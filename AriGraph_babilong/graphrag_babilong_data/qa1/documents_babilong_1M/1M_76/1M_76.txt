"Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

in the course of those official investigations which followed the
Revere disaster, and have already more than once been alluded to.Prior to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts had, as a
rule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom from accidents, and
there was every reason to suppose that their regulations were as
exact and their system as good as those in use in other parts of
the country.Yet it then appeared that in the rules of very few of
the Massachusetts roads had any provision, even of the simplest
character, been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders, or
the course to be pursued by employés in charge of trains on their
receipt.The appliances for securing intervals between following
trains were marked by a quaint simplicity.They were, indeed,
"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners on a
subsequent occasion described them, when it appeared that on one of
the principal roads of the state the interval between two closely
following trains was signalled to the engineer of the second train
by a station-master's holding up to him as he passed a number of
fingers corresponding to the number of minutes since the first
train had gone by.For the rest the examination revealed, as the
nearest approach to a block system, a queer collection of dials,
sand-glasses, green flags,  lanterns and hand-targets.The
climax in the course of that investigation was, however, reached
when some reference, involving a description of it, was made to the
English block.This was met by a protest on the part of one veteran
superintendent, who announced that it might work well under certain
circumstances, but for himself he could not be responsible for the
operation of a road running the number of trains he had charge of in
reliance on any such system.The subject, in fact, was one of which
he knew absolutely nothing;--not even that, through the block system
and through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually and safely
moved under circumstances where he moved one.This occurred in 1871,
and though eight years have since elapsed information in regard
to the block system is not yet very widely disseminated inside of
railroad circles, much less outside of them.It is none the less
a necessity of the future.It has got to be understood, and, in
some form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America there are
limits to the reliance which, when the lives and limbs of many are
at stake, can be placed on the "sharp look out" of any class of men,
no matter how intelligent they may be.The block system is of English origin, and it scarcely needs
to be said that it was adopted by the railroad corporations of
that country only when they were driven to it by the exigencies
of their traffic.But for that system, indeed, the most costly
portion of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity have
been duplicated years ago, as their traffic had fairly outgrown
those appliances of safety which have even to this time been found
sufficient in America.There were points, for instance, where two
hundred and seventy regular trains of one line alone passed daily.On the London & North-Western there are more than sixty through
down trains, taking no account of local trains, each day passing
over the same line of tracks, among which are express trains which
stop nowhere, way trains which stop everywhere, express-freight,
way-freight, mineral trains and parcel trains.On the Midland road
there are nearly twice as many similar trains on each track.On the
Metropolitan railway the average interval is three and one-third
minutes between trains.In one case points were mentioned where
270 regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction
during each twenty-four hours,--where 470 trains passed a single
station, the regular interval between them being but five-eighths
of a mile,--where 132 trains entered and left a single station
during three hours of each evening every day, being one train in
eighty-two seconds.In 1870 there daily reached or left the six
stations of the Boston roads some 385 trains; while no less than
650 trains a day were in the same year received and despatched from
a single one of the London stations.On one single exceptional
occasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons, were reported as
entering and leaving this station in the space of eighteen hours,
being rather more than a train a minute.Indeed it may well be
questioned whether the world anywhere else furnishes an illustration
so apt and dramatic of the great mechanical achievements of recent
times as that to be seen during the busy hours of any week-day from
the signal and interlocking galleries which span the tracks as
they enter the Charing Cross or Cannon street stations in London.Below and in front of the galleries the trains glide to and fro,
coming suddenly into sight from beyond the bridges and as suddenly
disappearing,--winding swiftly in and out, and at times four of them
running side by side on as many tracks but in both directions,--the
whole making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement under
the influence of which a head unaccustomed to the sight grows
actually giddy.Yet it is all done so quietly and smoothly, with
such an absence of haste and nervousness on the part of the stolid
operators in charge, that it is not easy to decide which most to
wonder at, the almost inconceivable magnitude and despatch of the
train-movement or the perfection of the appliances which make it
possible.No man concerned in the larger management of railroads,
who has not passed a morning in those London galleries, knows what
it is to handle a great city's traffic.Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be questioned
whether the block system as developed in England is likely to
be generally adopted on American railroads.Upon one or two of
them, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the
Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years.From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number
of objections.That in itself it is very perfect and has been
successfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible
contingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of
it.[13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of
work with comparative few accidents.The block system is, however,
none the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the
constant employment of a large number of skilled operators.Here
is the great defect in it from the American point of view.In this
country labor is scarce and capital costly.The effort is always
towards the perfecting of labor-saving machines.Hitherto the
pressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could
be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the
English system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,
would not have been warranted.As Barry says in his treatise on the
subject, "one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every possible known
precaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to
work a railway at all."[13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found
  in Barry's _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_.It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American
block system of the future will be essentially different from the
present English system.The basis--electricity--will of course be
the same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English
block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by
automatic action in the American.It is in this direction that the
whole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and
the advance has been very great.From peculiarities of condition
also the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak
points in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers
against which the English block provides only to a limited degree,
and always through the presence of yet other employés.For instance,
as will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,
far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact
with vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a
level therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout
America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these
crossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception.The English block affords protection against this danger by giving
electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed.So
also as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations
in crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare
to take their places in them.The rule in Europe is that passenger
crossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;
in America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,
but passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across
tracks as best they can in the face of passing trains.They are
expected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they
do it is most astonishing.Having been brought up to this self-care
all their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become
confused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the
statistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur
in America than in Europe.Nevertheless some provision is manifestly
desirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are
approaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves.Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest
source of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks.It
is, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by
accident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails.This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing
to do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such
break from being run into by any following train.The broken track
which the perfect block should give notice of is that where the
break is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the
fruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and
draw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in
the English reports, are most prominent among them.Wherever there
is a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will
be an accident.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,
in regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly
desirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges
or at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of
agents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat
in advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the
adoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been
directed towards the invention of an automatic system which at
one and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide
for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the
risks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of
nerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English
authorities are of opinion that it cannot.They insist that "if
automatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to
the duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be
used as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery
worked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to
exercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and
the machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go
wrong it shall check him."It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as
yet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has
undoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the
various automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or
brought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal
Company systems have been developed to a very marked degree of
perfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite
principles: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric
circuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and
conveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other
system, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric
circuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected
for the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the
breaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and
cars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential
difference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the
necessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in
the other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the
two the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,
having been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative
process common to all inventions, during which they are regarded
as of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a
succession of partial failures.So far as Hall's system is concerned
this period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in
established use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,
and especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily
incident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and
so complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,
stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block
system, through which it provides against dangers from collision and
broken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection
it affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so
designed that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,
but the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or
automatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is
notified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell
under Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of
the approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile
until it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents
can happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the
highway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within
half a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell
is ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the
prescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the
locomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance
from it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several
hundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.The electric
system improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point
of danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell
approaching the traveller.At any point of crossing which is really
dangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or
buildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is
vital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given
and cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really
given or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the
direction of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more
crowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are
protected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in
Great Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the
cabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block
system on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of
the approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has
heretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive
whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the
crossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under
the Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled
to be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is
neglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,
without releasing the corporation from its liability.In America
the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant
head lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the
locomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice
to the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring
experience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these
circumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a
matter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but
a watchman over him.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been
referred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief
use, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown
into the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,
which insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to
insure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment
into which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains
by, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each
other, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to
combine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the
throwing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The
Union Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than
this and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental
fracture or displacement of rails.Without attempting this the Hall
system has one other important feature in common with the English
block, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents
in case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within
half a mile or more of their stations on either side.Within the
given distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most
disastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at
Thorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,
whether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of
accident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of
the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means
without precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could
not but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been
tampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly
be provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is
not to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary
operation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,
or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary
assumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost
inseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the
great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The
complicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand
employés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and
did they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals
whose services are bought for money at the average market rate of
wages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic
machine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great
effort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this
result be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the
carelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track
instead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same
time a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small
economy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the
case of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the
Old Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped
on the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident
occurred, with Hall's system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was
well understood by the employés, and the company was sufficiently
satisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its
extension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure
involved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where
little danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these
was the "Foundry switch," so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch
been connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the
mere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,
and only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The
switch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,
and so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty
persons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the
delicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its
action necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged
against those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws
and level crossings, which have been particularly described.It
is argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a
great multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to
guard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any
electric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are
most likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway
grade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long
as the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly
when this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every
precaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,
by participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse
than nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains
and tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under
ordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,
go on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to
one serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor
by practical experience.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly
varied in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the
introduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first
and most persistently of all urged against the introduction of
railroads themselves.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it
is not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been
heard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,
and in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is
undeniable.In point of fact the whole
railroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to
train-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate
in that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that
it is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,
sensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of
visionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day
any sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and
rapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did
he not see it going on before his eyes.So it is with each new
appliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has
already been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be
seen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old "pretty and
ingenious" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case
of electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire
line of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train
movement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at
all, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the
vast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute
reliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon
to hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their
capacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do
not believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;
that, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what
to do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them
of responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if
they were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the
electric, in common with all other block systems by the large class
who prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather
than in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and
carelessness in employés;--that engine-drivers accustomed to rely
on the signals, rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of
recklessness which lead inevitably to accidents, for which they
then contend the signals, and not they themselves, are responsible.This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the "pretty and
ingenious" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and
disposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of
Trade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--

     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction
     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want
     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless
     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which
     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider
     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *
     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too
     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by
     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;
     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found
     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious
     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances
     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are
     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily
     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,
     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties
     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are
     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the
     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce
     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which
     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming
     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;
     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger
     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to
     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do
     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their
     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means
     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and
     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes
     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is
     constantly preserved.[14]

  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances
or greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to
carelessness in employés was carried to such an extent that only
within the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and
sunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and
stokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why
should not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too
comfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the
line of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched
men were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying
nature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined
before mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took
years in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn
that the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will
attend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long
experience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,
it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and
force, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next
new safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the
extracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block
system from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be
induced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument
from the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal
system entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has
it been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical
results, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of
fact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not
show that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents
during periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train
movements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances
more especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the
full average of accidents of the worst description appear to
have occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and
usually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of
accidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the
conditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose
that, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric
signals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,
with its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the
purely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been
in limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been
undergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable
degree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in
their earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not
been found open to the practical objections urged against them.At
first much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more
care than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a
single battery properly located can do all the necessary work for
a road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do
not lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph
wires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a
general signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with
railroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident
to exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now
through several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable
safeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they
will be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad
convergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage
of trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,
the English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,
indeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American
managers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an
indisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first
sight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and
simple methods, just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and
expense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is
most extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two
houses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,
could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is
not on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be
made very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and
Boston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street
station in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so
great that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground
devoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not
only must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be
idle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already
been referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing
spectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result
is that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,
more trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and
leave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad
stations in Boston combined.[15]

  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,
  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three
  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of
  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred
  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from
  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a
  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional
  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are
  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen
  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad
  Commissioners, p.141._

  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in
  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and
leave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It
contains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is
720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston
& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate
of 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily
accommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many
passengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic
of long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as
400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"

  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has
  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be
  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being
conducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks
utilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it
requires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London
standard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at
this time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other American
cities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a
slow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,
and the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself
felt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the
busy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but
be struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive
way in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all
connected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting
of switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never
stand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection
with each other, and during thirty years no change has been made
in the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be
shifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.The hall was named
Mazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s
took place in this old building.At a ball given in the hall during
one of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A.Ward,
bookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter
of one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance
of about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got
married.They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was
known all over the town the next day and produced great commotion.Miss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they
were finally divorced without having lived together.For a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in
this building.Heitz had participated in a number of battles under
the great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the
graphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often
relate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster
stew.*       *       *       *       *

During the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large
buildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel.Mozart hall was on
the Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner.At
a sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls
were thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was
held for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary
commission.Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the
principal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword
to the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the
front.A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities
on this plan, and the name of Col.Marshall of the Seventh regiment
and Col.Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it
was thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a
large vote.The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side
had some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number
of votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close
to carry off the prize.Uline had been a fireman and was very
popular with the young men of the city.Marshall was backed by
friends in the different newspaper offices.The contest was very
spirited and resulted in Col.Uline capturing the sword, he having
received more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last
five minutes the polls were open.This fair was very successful,
the patriotic citizens of St.Paul having enriched the funds of the
sanitary commission by several thousand dollars.*       *       *       *       *

One of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge
Square, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall.Whether it
was named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its
beverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine.*       *       *       *       *

In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more
pomp and glory than any holiday during the year.The Pioneer Guards,
the City Guards, the St.Paul fire
department and numerous secret organizations would form in
procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of
representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the
nation's first great hero would take place.Business was generally
suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the
following day.In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St.She was
about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company.They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river
towns.Their concert took place in the hall of the house of
representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available
place at the time.Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud
by an incident that has never been printed.Two boys employed as
messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business
men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a
number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they
were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of
playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations
as it was possible for kids to conceive.After an hour or so of
revelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated.In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall
and an alarm of fire was sounded.The door leading to the house was
forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned
through the floor.The boys knew at once that it was their
carelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids
never got together.They could see visions of policemen, prison bars,
and even Stillwater, day and night for many years.They would often
get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they
had yet been suspected.For more than a quarter of a century these two
kids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts,
and it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible
predicament.*       *       *       *       *

A few days after Maj.Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and
Stripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of
party, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives
for the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the
dastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government.Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was
packed and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of
the building in order that all who desired might take part in the
proceedings.John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided,
assisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents.John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the
principal speakers.Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for
congress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested
to hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict.Gilman was in hearty sympathy with
the object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great
demonstrations of approbation.Gilman
and made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr.There
were a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted
pledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling
on the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly
forming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid
when necessary to the dependant families of those left behind.Similar
meetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times
before the Rebellion was subdued.*       *       *       *       *

The first Republican state convention after the state was admitted
into the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives.The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time
and Col.Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for
representatives in congress.Aldrich did not pretend to be much
of an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while
he was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his
associates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and
he promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to
promote the success of the ticket.*       *       *       *       *

Aromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built
in 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of
the war.The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of
the social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by
the Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day.The Pioneer Guards
disbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members
were officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole
away and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's
staff during the entire war.Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others
followed as the war progressed.*       *       *       *       *

It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St.Paul could boast of a
genuine opera house.The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street,
on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished
that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local
talent.The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at
auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who
paid $72 for a seat in the parquet.This man Philbrick was a visitor
in St.Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him.It
was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and
when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people
were sure that he was at least a duke.He disappeared as mysteriously
as he had appeared.It was learned afterward that this mysterious
person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark.The first regular company to
occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily
Melville as the chief attraction.This little theater could seat about
1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long
before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed.Wendell
Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and
many others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old
opera house.An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was
in St.Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before
the lecture was to commence, and when Mr.Douglass commenced speaking
there was standing room only.A couple of enthusiastic Republicans
found standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in
front of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of
W.H.Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in
local Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous
swing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to
do was to swing around with him.Consequently the Republicans who
stood up behind Mr.Shelley thought they would have a little amusement
at his expense.Douglass made a point worthy
of applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great
demonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could
only see the huge outline of Mr.Shelley they concluded that he was
thoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the
Republican fold.Shelley stood it until the lecture was about
half over, when he left the opera house in disgust.Shelley was a
candidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St.Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson,
but as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked
confirmation.*       *       *       *       *

About the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England
a number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the
Athenaeum.There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at
that time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as
possible.James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the
Benecia boy.They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all
the attendants necessary for properly staging the melee.It was
prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock
Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and
Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged
plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out.And Hill has kept
right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,
and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty
years ago.PRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.SHELLEY THE PIONEER PRINTER OF MINNESOTA--A LARGE NUMBER OF

only known survivors: H.O.Bassford, George W. Benedict, David Brock,
John C. Devereux, Barrett Smith, J.B.H.Mitchell, David Ramaley, M.R.Prendergast, Jacob T. McCoy, A.S.Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer
editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to
the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed
by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of
people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, "the man behind
the gun," received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of
our early history.In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in
St.Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few
fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the
new territory of Minnesota.Accompanying him were two young printers,
named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot
on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the
great Northwest.These two young men quickly tired of their isolation
and returned to their former home.They were soon followed by another
young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains
of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his
country's honor.Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,
on the 25th of September, 1827.When a mere lad he removed to
Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on
the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule
and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to
take part in the campaign against the Mexicans.He was assigned to
the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of
hostilities.On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered
to report to Gen.Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across
the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista
followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces
were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third
dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special
mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position
against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the
leadership of Santa Ana.Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa
Ana withdrew from Gen.Taylor's front and retreated toward the City
of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the
American forces under the command of Gen.Peace was declared in
1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.Louis, where they were mustered out of the service.Shelly took
passage in a steamer for St.Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,
being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota.The
Pioneer was the first paper printed in St.Paul, but the Register and
Chronicle soon followed.Shelly's first engagement was in the
office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was
employed by Mr.Goodhue at the time of his tragic death.Shelly was connected
with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat
consolidated.Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and
when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the
old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with
Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's
battalion.Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they
were mustered into service in September, 1861.They were ordered to
report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known
as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry.In
February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and
arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and
surrender of Fort Donelson.Brackett's battalion was the only
Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were
not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and
exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.Buckner from receiving
reinforcements.After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual
scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and
the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them.From Fort Donelson
three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being
Capt.Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.Beauregard, who was only a short distance away.Brackett's company was
sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the
roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen.Buell to arrive at Pittsburg
Landing just in time to save Gen.Shelly's company was engaged in
protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,
Miss.On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the
rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief.This attack of the
rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,
1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort
Donelson.They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their
dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt.Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in
scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes
on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle.They
were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept
themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes.Opposed to
them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry
officers in the Confederate service.A number of severe actions ended
in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a
prominent part.After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept
on duty on the dividing line between the two forces.About the 1st
of January, 1864, most of Capt.Shelly's company reinlisted and they
returned home on a thirty days' furlough.After receiving a number
of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,
received orders to report to Gen.Sully at Sioux City, who was
preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux.On
the 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march
over the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana.It encountered the
Indians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way.About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and
the members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored
region.In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where
they went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since
leaving Fort Snelling.Shelly was mustered out of the service in
the spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has
been engaged at his old profession.Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many
stirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it
could well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that
"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country,
he would not in his old age have forsaken him."Political preferment
and self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye,
while others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of
their lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an
ungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.*       *       *       *       *

OTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer
office.He was an officer in the Pioneer Guards, and when the war
broke out was made a lieutenant in the First regiment, was in all the
battles of that famous organization up to and including Gettysburg;
was commander of the regiment for some time after the battle.After
the war he settled in Philadelphia, where he now resides.Jacob J. Noah at one time set type, with Robert Bonner.He was elected
clerk of the supreme court at the first election of state officers;
was captain of Company K Second Minnesota regiment, but resigned early
in the war and moved to New York City, his former home.Frank H. Pratt was an officer in the Seventh regiment and served
through the war.He published a paper at Taylor's Falls at one time.After the war he was engaged in the mercantile business in St.John C. Devereux was foreman of the old Pioneer and was an officer in
the Third regiment, and still resides in the city.Jacob T. McCoy was an old-time typo and worked in all the St.Paul
offices before and after the rebellion.McCoy was a fine singer
and his voice was always heard at typographical gatherings.He
enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four
years, returning as first lieutenant.He now resides in Meadeville,
Pa.Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both
before and after the war.He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota
cavalry.Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both
officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion
were engaged in the real estate business.Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the
war and foreman of the old St.He enlisted
during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and
served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier.No better
soldier ever left the state.He was collector of customs of the port
of St.Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and
Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press.The most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the
United States, was the late Charles R. Stuart.He claimed to be a
lineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart.For two years in
succession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more
type than any of his competitors.At an endurance test in New York he
is reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in
twenty-four hours.In the spring of
1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work.The
Minnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one
that day to help them out.Stuart was put to work and soon
distributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he
was going to do with it.After he had been at work a short time
they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had
distributed and probably more, too.When he pasted up the next morning
the foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over
and took a survey of Mr.Stuart, and then went back and measured it
again.He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no
one could discover anything wrong with it.The string measured 23,000
ems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in
this section of the country.Stuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for
the entire day.Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread
all over the city in a short time and people used to come to the
office to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to
see the typesetting machine.Stuart enlisted in the Eighth
regiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant.For
a number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which
place he died about five years ago.He was not only a good printer,
but a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything
connected with the printing business.Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers.He served three
years in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the
Pioneer.Clum is one of the oldest printers in St.He was born in
Rensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St.He learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late
minister to Greece, and also with C.L.McArthur, editor of the
Northern Budget.Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota,
and took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion.Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the
Union.At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St.During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who
were attached to the First regiment.S J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days.In 1859 he
went to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory.He was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion.For
many years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last
administration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska.Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business
for some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth
Minnesota during the rebellion.Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was
connected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years.Robert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St.He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy
Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley.He was a
member of the Seventh Minnesota.Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in
a hospital in Virginia.William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of
sharpshooters in St.Paul, and they served throughout the war in the
army of the Potomac.S. Teverbaugh and H.I.Vance were territorial printers, and were both
in the army, but served in regiments outside the state.There were a large number of other printers in the military service
during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their
names are not included in the above list.TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE.One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to
Minnesota at an early day was Mr.For a time he worked on
the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the
editorial department, where he remained for a number of years.After
the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for
a number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post.Paul who were musically inclined
no one was better known than the late O.G.He belonged to the
Great Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the
city for a number of years.Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and
when he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic
hall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city.Paul in 1850, and for a short time was
foreman for Mr.In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P.
Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian.He sold his interest
in that paper to Dr.Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by
President Lincoln collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he
held for more than twenty years.Louis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen.Paul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser.For a long time he
was one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press.He
was a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity.At one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket.Had it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been
nominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor.George W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers.He
wore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he
always appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than
most of his co-laborers.He was elected state treasurer on the
democratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office
devoted his attention to the real estate business.Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M.
Culver.Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect
how strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when
taking the third degree of that noble order.He is one of the best as well as
one of the best known printers in the Northwest.He has been printer,
reporter, editor, publisher and type founder.Although he has been
constantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active
and energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out
the century mark.Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and
cleanest compositers among the territorial printers.He was employed
on the Minnesotian.Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the
printing business--printer, reporter, editor.He was a most estimable
man, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to
his reward.The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years
familiar to most old-time residents.At one time he was foreman of the
old St.He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids
Sentinel.Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard
Bradley.He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held
the same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years.Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled "Who Stole Ben
Johnson's Spaces."The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St.Owens in the publication of the
Minnesotian.For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St.Paul,
and held several other positions of trust.Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum,
publishers of the Daily Times.For several years after the war he was
engaged as compositor in the St.Paul offices, and is now farming in
Northern Minnesota.Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet
printer by the name of Wentworth.He was called "Long Haired
Wentworth."Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment.Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut.Wentworth
would not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was
summarly dismissed from the service.After being ordered out of the
regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary
Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other
political prisoners.Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the
publication of the first paper at Glencoe.At one time he was a
compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state
printer for Nevada.Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat.He was a
printer-politician and possessed considerable ability.At one time he
was one of the editors of the Democrat.He was said to bear a striking
resemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with
any one without informing them of the fact.He was one of the original
Jacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar,
which he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was
christened.No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume
on one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver
dollar.He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that
the immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity.Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column
was J.Q.A.He was business manager
of the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper.The first
immigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product
of Jack's ingenuity.Jack created quite a sensation at one time by
marrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room
acquaintance.He was a very bright man and should have been one of the
foremost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was
his own worst enemy.Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour.His
theory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business
it was always better to give up the business.Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he
was also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity.It was
no uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to
be printers.Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent
actors were knights of the stick and rule.Frequently during the happy
distribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist
and the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would
receive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled
in a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat,
but modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will
receive their diplomas from the composing room.Since the introduction
of the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the
sociability that once existed in the composing room will be known
hereafter only to tradition.The late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old
Pioneer composing room.He was well posted on all topics and was
always ready to take either side of a question for the sake of
argument.Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that
would have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would
talk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often
surprised and always entertained the weary distributors.At one time
Jebb was reporter on the St.Raising blooded chickens
was one of his hobbies.One night some one entered his premises and
appropriated, a number of his pet fowls.The next day the Times had a
long account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article
he hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant.It was
a fatal bull and was Mr.A fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous
biography of Washington.The editor of the paper on which he was
employed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate
appearance.To make the matter more offensive the author on several
different occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship
to the editor who was compelled to apologize for it.In two different articles on nationalities by two different young
printer reporters, one referred to the Germans as "the beer-guzzling
Dutch," and the other, speaking of the English said "thank the Lord we
have but few of them in our midst," caused the writers to be promptly
relegated back to the case.Bishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times.A
short conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he
wasn't really a bishop.In an account of confirming a number of people
at Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said "Bishop
Willoughby administered the rite of confirmation," when he should have
said Bishop Whipple.He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder
that he at once tendered his resignation.Editors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated
than they are to-day.Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for
economical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same
room.All the offices contained blankets and cots, and as morning
newspapers were only morning newspapers in name, the tired and weary
printer could sleep the sleep of the just without fear of disturbance.Earle S. Goodrich,
editor-in-chief of the Pioneer: Thomas Foster, editor of the
Minnesotian; T.M.Newson, editor of the Times, and John P. Owens,
first editor of the Minnesotian, were all printers.When the old Press
removed from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner
of Third and Minnesota streets, Earle S. Goodrich came up into the
composing room and requested the privilege of setting the first type
in the new building.He was provided with a stick and rule and set
up about half a column of editorial without copy.The editor of the
Press, in commenting on his article, said it was set up as "clean as
the blotless pages of Shakespeare."In looking over the article the
next morning some of the typos discovered an error in the first line.THE DECISIVE BATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS.THE FIRST BATTLE DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNION FORCES SCORED
A DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE
REBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED.Every Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made
of the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the
great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion.At the outbreak
of the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so
intensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments
volunteered at the first call of the president.As only ten companies
could go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for
a second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming.On the
16th of June, 1861, Gov.Ramsey received notice that a second regiment
would be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized
with two or three additions made up the famous Second Minnesota.Van Cleve was appointed colonel, with headquarters at Fort Snelling.Several of the companies were sent to the frontier to relieve
detachments of regulars stationed at various posts, but on the 16th of
October, 1861, the full regiment started for Washington.On reaching
Pittsburgh, however, their destination was changed to Louisville, at
which place they were ordered to report to Gen.Sherman, then in
command of the Department of the Cumberland, and they at once received
orders to proceed to Lebanon Junction, about thirty miles south of
Louisville.The regiment remained at this camp about six weeks before
anything occurred to relieve the monotony of camp life, although there
were numerous rumors of night attacks by large bodies of Confederates.On the 15th of November, 1861, Gen.Buell assumed command of all the
volunteers in the vicinity of Louisville, and he at once organized
them into divisions and brigades.Early in December the Second
regiment moved to Lebanon, Ky., and, en route, the train was fired at.At Lebanon the Second Minnesota, Eighteenth United States infantry,
Ninth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments were organized into a brigade,
and formed part of Gen.Thomas started his troops on the Mill Springs campaign
and from the 1st to the 17th day of January, spent most of its time
marching under rain, sleet and through mud, and on the latter date
went into camp near Logan's Cross Roads, eight miles north of
Zollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove.18, Company A was on picket duty.It had been raining incessantly
and was so dark that it was with difficulty that pickets could be
relieved.Just at daybreak the rebel advance struck the pickets of
the Union lines, and several musket shots rang out with great
distinctness, and in quick succession, it being the first rebel shot
that the boys had ever heard.The
firing soon commenced again, nearer and more distinct than at first,
and thicker and faster as the rebel advance encountered the Union
pickets.The Second Minnesota had entered the woods and passing
through the Tenth Indiana, then out of ammunition and retiring and no
longer firing.The enemy, emboldened by the cessation and mistaking
its cause, assumed they had the Yanks on the run, advanced to the rail
fence separating the woods from the field just as the Second Minnesota
was doing the same, and while the rebels got there first, they were
also first to get away and make a run to their rear.But before
they ran their firing was resumed and Minnesotians got busy and the
Fifteenth Mississippi and the Sixteenth Alabama regiments were made
to feel that they had run up against something.To the right of the
Second were two of Kinney's cannon and to their right was the Ninth
Ohio.The mist and smoke which hung closely was too thick to see
through, but by lying down it was possible to look under the smoke and
to see the first rebel line, and that it was in bad shape, and back of
it and down on the low ground a second line, with their third line
on the high ground on the further side of the field.That the Second
Minnesota was in close contact with the enemy was evident all along
its line, blasts of fire and belching smoke coming across the fence
from Mississippi muskets.The contest was at times hand to hand--the
Second Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence,
firing and using the bayonet when opportunity offered.The firing was
very brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that
the enemy had disappeared.The battle was over, the Johnnies had
"skedaddled," leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field.Many
of the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered.After
the firing had ceased one rebel lieutenant bravely stood in front
of the Second and calmly faced his fate.After being called on to
surrender he made no reply, but deliberately raised his hand and shot
Lieut.His name proved
to be Bailie Peyton, son of one of the most prominent Union men in
Tennessee.Zollicoffer, commander of the Confederate forces, was
also killed in this battle.This battle, although a mere skirmish when
compared to many other engagements in which the Second participated
before the close of the war, was watched with great interest by the
people of St.Two full companies had been recruited in the city
and there was quite a number of St.Paulites in other companies of
this regiment.When it became known that a battle had been fought
in which the Second had been active participants, the relatives and
friends of the men engaged in the struggle thronged the newspaper
offices in quest of information regarding their safety.The casualties
in the Second Minnesota, amounted to twelve killed and thirty-five
wounded.Two or three days after the battle letters were received from
different members of the Second, claiming that they had shot Bailie
Payton and Zollicoffer.It afterward was learned that no one ever
knew who shot Peyton, and that Col.Fry of the Fourth Kentucky shot
Zollicoffer.Tuttle captured Peyton's sword and still has it in
his possession.It was presented to
Bailie Peyton by the citizens of New Orleans at the outbreak of the
Mexican war, and was carried by Col.Scott's staff at the close of the war, and
when Santa Anna surrendered the City of Mexico to Gen.Peyton was the staff officer designated by Scott to receive the
surrender of the city, carrying this sword by his side.It bears
this inscription: "Presented to Col.Bailie Peyton, Fifth Regiment
Louisiana Volunteer National Guards, by his friends of New Orleans.His deeds will add glory to
her arms."There has been considerable correspondence between the
government and state, officials and the descendants of Col.Peyton
relative to returning this trophy to Col.Peyton's relatives, but so
far no arrangements to that effect have been concluded.It was reported by Tennesseeans at the time of the battle that young
Peyton was what was known as a "hoop-skirt" convert to the Confederate
cause.Southern ladies were decidedly more pronounced secessionists
than were the sterner sex, and whenever they discovered that one of
their chivalric brethren was a little lukewarm toward the cause of the
South they sent him a hoop skirt, which indicated that the recipient
was lacking in bravery.For telling of his loyalty to the Union he
was insulted and hissed at on the streets of Nashville, and when he
received a hoop skirt from his lady friends he reluctantly concluded
to take up arms against the country he loved so well.He paid the
penalty of foolhardy recklessness in the first battle in which he
participated.A correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial, who was an eye-witness
of the battle, gave a glowing description of the heroic conduct of the
Second Minnesota during the engagement.He said: "The success of the
battle was when the Second Minnesota and the Ninth Ohio appeared in
good order sweeping through the field.The Second Minnesota, from its
position in the column, was almost in the center of the fight, and in
the heaviest of the enemy's fire.They were the first troops that used
the bayonet, and the style with which they went into the fight is the
theme of enthusiastic comment throughout the army."It was the boast of Confederate leaders at the outbreak of the
rebellion that one regiment of Johnnies was equal to two or more
regiments of Yankees.After the battle of Mill Springs they had
occasion to revise their ideas regarding the fighting qualities of the
detested Yankees.From official reports of both sides, gathered after
the engagement was over, it was shown that the Confederate forces
outnumbered their Northern adversaries nearly three to one.The victory proved a dominant factor in breaking up the Confederate
right flank, and opened a way into East Tennessee, and by transferring
the Union troops to a point from which to menace Nashville made the
withdrawal of Gen.Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green,
Ky., to Nashville necessary.Confederate loss, 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners.Union loss,
248 in killed and wounded.Twelve rebel cannon and caissons complete
were captured.Two hundred wagons with horses in harness were
captured, as were large quantities of ammunition, store and camp
equipments--in fact, the Union troops took all there was.Fry's version of the killing of Zollicoffer is as follows: While
on the border of "old fields" a stranger in citizen clothes rode up by
his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder,
and said: "Don't let us be firing on our own men.Those are our men,"
pointing at the same time toward our forces.Fry looked upon him
inquiringly a moment, supposing him to be one of his own men, after
which he rode forward not more than fifteen paces, when an officer
came dashing up, first recognizing the stranger and almost the same
instant firing upon Col.At the same moment the stranger wheeled
his horse, facing Col.Fry, when the colonel shot him in the breast.Zollicoffer was a prominent and influential citizen of Nashville
previous to the war, and stumped the state with Col.Peyton in
opposition to the ordinance of secession, but when Tennessee seceded
he determined to follow the fortunes of his state.Zollicoffer made a speech to his troops in which he said
he would take them to Indiana or go to hell himself.The poet of the Fourth Kentucky perpetrated the following shortly
after the battle:

  "Old Zollicoffer is dead
  And the last word he said:
  I see a wild cat coming.And he hit him in the eye
  And he sent him to the happy land of Canaan.Hip hurrah for the happy land of freedom."The loyal Kentuckians were in great glee and rejoiced over the
victory.It was their battle against rebel invaders from Tennessee,
Mississippi and Alabama, who were first met by their own troops of
Wolford's First cavalry and the Fourth Kentucky infantry, whose blood
was the first to be shed in defense of the Stars and Stripes; and
their gratitude went out to their neighbors from Minnesota, Indiana
and Ohio who came to their support and drove the invaders out of their
state.24, 1862, the Second Minnesota was again in Louisville,
where the regiment had admirers and warm friends in the loyal ladies,
who as evidence of their high appreciation, though the mayor of the
city, Hon.Dolph, presented to the Second regiment a silk flag."Each regiment is equally entitled to like honor, but
the gallant conduct of those who came from a distant state to unite
in subduing our rebel invaders excites the warmest emotions of our
hearts."25 President Lincoln's congratulations were read to the
regiment, and on Feb.9, at Waitsboro, Ky., the following joint
resolution of the Minnesota legislature was read before the regiment:


Whereas, the noble part borne by the First regiment, Minnesota
infantry, in the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, Va., is
yet fresh in our minds; and, whereas, we have heard with equal
satisfaction the intelligence of the heroism displayed by the Second
Minnesota infantry in the late brilliant action at Mill Springs, Ky.:

Therefore be it resolved by the legislature of Minnesota, That while
it was the fortune of the veteran First regiment to shed luster upon
defeat, it was reserved for the glorious Second regiment to add
victory to glory.Resolved, that the bravery of our noble sons, heroes whether in defeat
or victory, is a source of pride to the state that sent them forth,
and will never fail to secure to them the honor and the homage of the
government and the people.Resolved, That we sympathize with the friends of our slain soldiers,
claiming as well to share their grief as to participate in the renown
which the virtues and valor of the dead have conferred on our arms.Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, having the signature
of the executive and the great seal of the state, be immediately
forwarded by the governor to the colonels severally in command of
the regiments, to be by them communicated to their soldiers at dress
parade.The battle at Mill Springs was the first important victory achieved by
the Union army in the Southwest after the outbreak of the rebellion,
and the result of that engagement occasioned great rejoicing
throughout the loyal North.Although the battle was fought forty-five
years ago, quite a number of men engaged in that historic event
are still living in St.Paul, a number of them actively engaged in
business.Clum, William Bircher, Robert G. Rhodes,

OF THE CIVIL WAR--TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE--GALLANT ACTION OF THE FIRST
MINNESOTA BATTERY--DEATH OF CAPT.The battle of Pittsburg Landing on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, was
one of the most terrific of the many great battles of the great Civil
war.It has been likened to the battle of Waterloo.Napoleon sought to
destroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with
Blucher.Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of
the Tennessee, under Gen.Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland,
under Buell, could come to his assistance.At the second battle of
Bull Run Gen.Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns,
yet he remained inactive.At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by
military men that Gen.Buell could have made a junction with Grant
twenty-four hours sooner and thereby saved a terrible loss of life had
he chosen to do so.Both generals were subsequently suspended from
their commands and charges of disloyalty were made against them by
many newspapers in the North.Porter was tried by court-martial
and dismissed from the service.Many years after this decision was
revoked by congress and the stigma of disloyalty removed from his
name.Buell was tried by court-martial, but the findings of the
court were never made public.Buell
was guilty of the charges against him, and when he became
commander-in-chief of the army in 1864 endeavored to have him restored
to his command, but the war department did not seem inclined to do so.About two weeks before the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen.Grant
was suspended from the command of the Army of the Tennessee by Gen.Halleck, but owing to some delay in the transmission of the order, an
order came from headquarters restoring him to his command before he
knew that he had been suspended.Grant's success at Fort Henry
and Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous of his popularity.McClellan, but the order was held up by the
war department until Gen.The reason for
his arrest was that he went to Nashville to consult with Buell without
permission of the commanding general.Dispatches sent to Grant for
information concerning his command was never delivered to him, but
were delivered over to the rebel authorities by a rebel telegraph
operator, who shortly afterward joined the Confederate forces.Badeau, one of Grant's staff officers,
was in search of information for his "History of Grant's Military
Campaigns," and he unearthed in the archives of the war department the
full correspondence between Halleck, McClellan and the secretary of
war, and it was not until then that Gen.Grant learned the full extent
of the absurd accusations made against him.Halleck assumed personal
command of all the forces at that point and Gen.Grant was placed
second in command, which meant that he had no command at all.This
was very distasteful to Gen.Grant and he would have resigned his
commission and returned to St.Louis but for the interposition of his
friend, Gen.Grant had packed up his belongings
and was about to depart when Gen.Sherman met him at his tent and
persuaded him to refrain.In a short time Halleck was ordered to
Washington and Grant was made commander of the Department of West
Tennessee, with headquarters at Memphis.Grant's subsequent
career proved the wisdom of Sherman's entreaty.Halleck assumed command he constructed magnificent
fortifications, and they were a splendid monument to his engineering
skill, but they were never occupied.He was like the celebrated king
of France, who "with one hundred thousand men, marched up the hill and
then down again."Halleck had under his immediate command more
than one hundred thousand well equipped men, and the people of
the North looked to him to administer a crushing blow to the then
retreating enemy.The hour had arrived--the man had not."Flushed with the victory of Forts Henry and Donelson," said the
envious Halleck in a dispatch to the war department, previous to
the battle, "the army under Grant at Pittsburg Landing was more
demoralized than the Army of the Potomac after the disastrous defeat
of Bull Run."Scott predicted that the
war would soon be ended--that thereafter there would be nothing but
guerrilla warfare at interior points.Grant himself in his
memoirs says that had the victory at Pittsburg Landing been followed
up and the army been kept intact the battles at Stone River,
Chattanooga and Chickamauga would not have been necessary.Probably the battle of Pittsburg Landing was the most misunderstood
and most misrepresented of any battle occurring during the war.It
was charged that Grant was drunk; that he was far away from the
battleground when the attack was made, and was wholly unprepared to
meet the terrible onslaught of the enemy in the earlier stages of the
encounter.Beauregard is said to have stated on the morning
of the battle that before sundown he would water his horses in the
Tennessee river or in hell.That the rebels did not succeed in
reaching the Tennessee was not from lack of dash and daring on their
part, but was on account of the sturdy resistance and heroism of their
adversaries.Grant's own account of the battle,
though suffering intense pain from a sprained ankle, he was in the
saddle from early morning till late at night, riding from division to
division, giving directions to their commanding officers regarding the
many changes in the disposition of their forces rendered necessary
by the progress of the battle.The firm resistance made by the force
under his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the
charges made against him.Misunderstanding of orders, want of
co-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of
recruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter
of the Union forces on the first day of the battle.*       *       *       *       *

The battle of Pittsburg Landing is sometimes called the battle of
Shiloh, some of the hardest lighting having been done in the vicinity
of an old log church called the Church of Shiloh, about three miles
from the landing.The battle ground traversed by the opposing forces occupied a
semi-circle of about three and a half miles from the town of
Pittsburg, the Union forces being stationed in the form of a
semi-circle, the right resting on a point north of Crump's Landing,
the center being directly in front of the road to Corinth, and the
left extending to the river in the direction of Harrisburg--a small
place north of Pittsburg Landing.At about 2 o'clock on Sunday
morning, Col.Peabody of Prentiss' division, fearing that everything
was not right, dispatched a body of 400 men beyond the camp for the
purpose of looking after any body of men which might be lurking in
that direction.This step was wisely taken, for a half a mile advance
showed a heavy force approaching, who fired upon them with great
slaughter.This force taken by surprise, was compelled to retreat,
which they did in good order under a galling fire.At 6 o'clock the
fire had become general along the entire front, the enemy having
driven in the pickets of Gen.Sherman's division and had fallen with
vengeance upon three Ohio regiments of raw recruits, who knew nothing
of the approach of the enemy until they were within their midst.The
slaughter on the first approach of the enemy was very severe, scores
falling at every discharge of rebel guns.It soon became apparent that
the rebel forces were approaching in overwhelming numbers and there
was nothing left for them to do but retreat, which was done with
considerable disorder, both officers and men losing every particle of
their baggage, which fell into rebel hands.At 8:30 o'clock the fight had become general, the second line of
divisions having received the advance in good order and made every
preparation for a suitable reception of the foe.At this time many
thousand stragglers, many of whom had never before heard the sound
of musketry, turned their backs to the enemy, and neither threats or
persuasion could induce them to turn back.Grant, who had hastened up from Savannah, led to the adoption of
measures that put a stop to this uncalled-for flight from the battle
ground.A strong guard was placed across the thoroughfare, with orders
to hault every soldier whose face was turned toward the river, and
thus a general stampede was prevented.At 10 o'clock the entire line
on both sides was engaged in one of the most terrible battles ever
known in this country.The roar of the cannon and musketry was without
intermission from the main center to a point extending halfway down
the left wing.The great struggle was most upon the forces which had
fallen back on Sherman's position.By 11 o'clock quite a number of the
commanders of regiments had fallen, and in some instances not a single
field officer remained; yet the fighting continued with an earnestness
that plainly showed that the contest on both sides was for death or
victory.The almost deafening sound of artillery and the rattle of
musketry was all that could be heard as the men stood silently and
delivered their fire, evidently bent on the work of destruction which
knew no bounds.Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow
strip of open land dividing the opponents.Many who were maimed fell
back without help, while others still fought in the ranks until they
were actually forced back by their company officers.Finding it
impossible to drive back the center of our column, at 12 o'clock the
enemy slackened fire upon it and made a most vigorous effort on our
left wing, endeavoring to drive it to the river bank at a point about
a mile and a half above Pittsburg Landing.With the demonstration of
the enemy upon the left wing it was soon seen that all their fury was
being poured out upon it, with a determination that it should give
way.For about two hours a sheet of fire blazed both columns, the
rattle of musketry making a most deafening noise.For about an hour it
was feared that the enemy would succeed in driving our forces to the
river bank, the rebels at times being plainly seen by those on the
main landing below.While the conflict raged the hottest in this
quarter the gunboat Tyler passed slowly up the river to a point
directly opposite the enemy and poured in a broadside from her immense
guns.The shells went tearing and crashing through the woods, felling
trees in their course and spreading havoc wherever they fell.The
explosions were fearful, the shells falling far inland, and they
struck terror to the rebel force.Foiled in this attempt, they now
made another attack on the center and fought like tigers.They found
our lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming.Every
man was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite
conclusion.In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements,
under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every
effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the
battle ground.They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel.Volley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was
re-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both sides.At 5 o'clock there was a short cessation in the firing of the enemy,
their lines falling back on the center for about half a mile.They
again wheeled and suddenly threw their entire force upon the left
wing, determined to make the final struggle of the day in that
quarter.The gunboat Lexington in the meantime had arrived from
Savannah, and after sending a message to Gen.Grant to ascertain in
which direction the enemy was from the river, the Lexington and Tyler
took a position about half a mile above the river landing, and poured
their shells up a deep ravine reaching to the river on the right.Their shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect.Lew Wallace, who had taken a circuitous route from
Crump's Landing, appeared suddenly on the left wing of the rebels.In
face of this combination the enemy felt that their bold effort was for
the day a failure and as night was about at hand, they slowly fell
back, fighting as they went, until they reached an advantageous
position, somewhat in the rear, yet occupying the main road to
Corinth.The gunboats continued to send their shells after them until
they were far beyond reach.Throughout the day the rebels evidently had fought with the Napoleonic
idea of massing their entire force on weak points of the enemy, with
the intention of braking through their lines, creating a panic and
cutting off retreat.The first day's battle, though resulting in a terrible loss of Union
troops, was in reality a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders.They fully expected, with their overwhelming force to annihilate
Grant's army, cross the Tennessee river and administer the same
punishment to Buell, and then march on through Tennessee, Kentucky and
into Ohio.They had conceived a very bold movement, but utterly failed
to execute it.Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate forces,
was killed in the first day's battle, being shot while attempting to
induce a brigade of unwilling Confederates to make a charge on the
enemy.Buell was at Columbia, Tenn., on the 19th of March with a veteran
force of 40,000 men, and it required nineteen days for him to reach
the Tennessee river, eighty-five miles distant, marching less than
five miles a day, notwithstanding the fact that he had been ordered to
make a junction with Grant's forces as soon as possible, and was well
informed of the urgency of the situation.During the night steamers were engaged in carrying the troops of
Nelson's division across the river.As soon as the boats reached the
shore the troops immediately left, and, without music, took their way
to the advance of the left wing of the Union forces.They had come up
double quick from Savannah, and as they were regarded as veterans, the
greatest confidence was soon manifest as to the successful termination
of the battle.With the first hours of daylight it was evident that
the enemy had also been strongly reinforced, for, notwithstanding they
must have known of the arrival of new Union troops, they were first to
open the ball, which they did with considerable alacrity.The attacks
that began came from the main Corinth road, a point to which they
seemed strongly attached, and which at no time did they leave
unprotected.Within half an hour from the first firing in the morning
the contest then again spread in either direction, and both the main
and left wings were not so anxious to fight their way to the river
bank as on the previous day, having a slight experience of what they
might expect if again brought under the powerful guns of the Tyler and
Lexington.They were not, however, lacking in activity, and they
were met by our reinforced troops with an energy that they did not
anticipate.At 9 o'clock the sound of the artillery and musketry fully
equaled that of the day before.It now became evident that the rebels
were avoiding our extreme left wing, and were endeavoring to find a
weak point in our line by which they could turn our force and thus
create a panic.They left one point but to return to it immediately,
and then as suddenly would direct an assault upon a division where
they imagined they would not be expected.The fire of the united
forces was as steady as clockwork, and it soon became evident that
the enemy considered the task they had undertaken a hopeless one.Notwithstanding continued repulses, the rebels up to 11 o'clock had
given no evidence of retiring from the field.Their firing had been as
rapid and vigorous at times as during the most terrible hours of
the previous day.Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson and Crittenden were
present everywhere directing the movements on our part for a new
strike against the foe.Lew Wallace's division on the right had
been strongly reinforced, and suddenly both wings of our army were
turned upon the enemy, with the intention of driving the immense body
into an extensive ravine.At the same time a powerful battery had been
stationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into
the rebel ranks and with the most telling effect.At 11:30 o'clock the
roar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being
fired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory
inspired.The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began
to evince a desire to withdraw.They fought as they slowly moved back,
keeping up their fire from their artillery and musketry, apparently
disclaiming any notion that they thought of retreating.As they
retreated they went in excellent order, halting at every advantageous
point and delivering their fire with considerable effect.At noon it
was settled beyond dispute that the rebels were retreating.They were
making but little fire, and were heading their center column for
Corinth.From all divisions of our lines they were closely pursued,
a galling fire being kept up on their rear, which they returned at
intervals with little or no effect.From Sunday morning until Monday
noon not less than three thousand cavalry had remained seated In their
saddles on the hilltop overlooking the river, patiently awaiting the
time when an order should come for them to pursue the flying enemy.That time had now arrived and a courier from Gen.Grant had scarcely
delivered his message before the entire body was in motion.The wild
tumult of the excited riders presented a picture seldom witnessed on a
battlefield.*       *       *       *       *

Gen.Grant, in his memoirs, summarizes the results of the two days'
fighting as follows: "I rode forward several miles the day of the
battle and found that the enemy had dropped nearly all of their
provisions and other luggage in order to enable them to get off with
their guns.An immediate pursuit would have resulted in the capture
of a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns...." The
effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the 6th was
33,000 men.Lew Wallace brought 5,000 more after nightfall.Beauregard
reported the rebel strength at 40,955.Excluding the troops who fled,
there was not with us at any time during the day more than 25,000 men
in line.Our loss in the two days' fighting was 1,754 killed, 8,408
wounded and 2,885 missing.Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699,
of whom 1,728 were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing.Prentiss, during a change of
position of the Union forces, became detached from the rest of the
troops, and was taken prisoner, together with 2,200 of his men.Wallace, division commander, was killed in the early part of
the struggle.The hardest fighting during the first day was done in front of the
divisions of Sherman and McClernand."A casualty to Sherman," says
Gen.Grant, "that would have taken him from the field that day would
have been a sad one for the Union troops engaged at Shiloh.On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the
hand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a
slight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat.In addition to
this he had several horses shot during the day."Hawkins got beyond the left of our troops.There did not appear
to be an enemy in sight, but suddenly a battery opened on them from
the edge of the woods.They made a hasty retreat and when they were
at a safe distance halted to take an account of the damage.McPherson's horse dropped dead, having been shot just
back of the saddle.Hawkins' hat and a
ball had struck the metal of Gen.Grant's sword, breaking it nearly
off.On the first day of the battle about 6,000 fresh recruits who had
never before heard the sound of musketry, fled on the approach of the
enemy.They hid themselves on the river bank behind the bluff, and
neither command nor persuasion could induce them to move.Buell discovered them on his arrival he threatened to fire on them,
but it had no effect.Grant says that afterward those same men
proved to be some of the best soldiers in the service.Grant, in his report, says he was prepared with the
reinforcements of Gen.Lew Wallace's division of 5,000 men to assume
the offensive on the second day of the battle, and thought he could
have driven the rebels back to their fortified position at Corinth
without the aid of Buell's army.*       *       *       *       *

At banquet hall, regimental reunion or campfire, whenever mention is
made of the glorious record of Minnesota volunteers in the great Civil
war, seldom, if ever, is the First Minnesota battery given credit
for its share in the long struggle.Probably very few of the present
residents of Minnesota are aware that such an organization existed.This battery was one of the finest organizations that left the state
during the great crisis.It was in the terrible battle of Pittsburg
Landing, the siege of Vicksburg, in front of Atlanta and in the great
march from Atlanta to the sea, and in every position in which they
were placed they not only covered themselves with glory, but they were
an honor and credit to the state that sent them.The First Minnesota
battery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall
of 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain.Shortly after
being mustered in they were ordered to St.Louis, where they received
their accoutrements, and from there they were ordered to Pittsburg
Landing, arriving at the latter place late in February, 1862.The day
before the battle, they were transferred to Prentiss' division of
Grant's army.On Sunday morning, April 6, the battery was brought out
bright and early, preparing for inspection.About 7 o'clock great
commotion was heard at headquarters, and the battery was ordered to be
ready to march at a moment's notice.In about ten minutes they were
ordered to the front, the rebels having opened fire on the Union
forces.In a very short time rebel bullets commenced to come thick and
fast, and one of their number was killed and three others wounded.It
soon became evident that the rebels were in great force in front
of the battery, and orders were issued for them to choose another
position.At about 11 o'clock the battery formed in a new position
on an elevated piece of ground, and whenever the rebels undertook to
cross the field in front of them the artillery raked them down with
frightful slaughter.Several times the rebels placed batteries In the
timber at the farther end of the field, but in each instance the
guns of the First battery dislodged them before they could get into
position.For hours the rebels vainly endeavored to break the lines
of the Union forces, but in every instance they were repulsed with
frightful loss, the canister mowing them down at close range.About 5
o'clock the rebels succeeded in flanking Gen.Prentiss and took part
of his force prisoners.The battery was immediately withdrawn to an
elevation near the Tennessee river, and it was not long before firing
again commenced and kept up for half an hour, the ground fairly
shaking from the continuous firing on both sides of the line.At
about 6 o'clock the firing ceased, and the rebels withdrew to a safe
distance from the landing.The casualties of the day were three killed
and six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward.The fight
at what was known as the "hornet's nest" was most terrific, and had
not the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels
would have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a
point dangerously near the Tennessee river.Munch's horse
received a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself
received a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service
during the battle.Pfaender took
command of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during
the day.Buell having arrived, the
battery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle
that day.The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota
engaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the
struggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole
rebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the
commanding officer.It was the first battle in which they had taken
part, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks
before, they had not had much opportunity for drill work.Their
terrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they
had met a foe worthy of their steel.*       *       *       *       *

Among the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained
field of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in
the hearts of the patriotic people of St.Paul,--a name that was as
dear to the people of St.Paul as was the memory of the immortal
Ellsworth to the people of Chicago.William Henry Acker, while
marching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with
voice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray,
was pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the
ill-fated field.Acker was advised by his comrades not
to wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel
bullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die
he would die with his harness on.Soon after forming his command into
line, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out
by a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the."Loved, almost adored, by the
company," says one of them, writing of the sad event, "Capt.Acker's
fall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command."With a last look at their dead commander, and with the
watchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns
carried death into the ranks of his murderers.From that moment but
one feeling seemed to possess his still living comrades--that of
revenge for the death of their captain.How terribly they carried out
that purpose the number of rebel slain piled around the vicinity of
his body fearfully attest.Acker was a very severe blow to
his relatives and many friends in this city.No event thus far in the
history of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing
sense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the
battlefield.A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of
freedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the
nation's heroes.Acker was born a soldier--brave, able, popular and
courteous--and had he lived would undoubtedly been placed high in rank
long before the close of the rebellion.No person ever went to the
front in whom the citizens of St.Paul had more hope for a brilliant
future.He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight
years of age at the time of his death.Paul in 1854 and
commenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon.He did not remain long in the law business, however, but
soon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just
been established by ex-Gov.For some time he was captain of
the Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming,
and which was the finest military organization in the West at
that time.In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a
marching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham
Lincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that
exciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that
great struggle that soon followed.Little did the captain imagine at
that time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so
soon be the means of his untimely death.At the breaking out of the
war Capt.Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he
thought he would be of more use to his country in active service and
resigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota
regiment, of which he was made captain.At the first battle of Bull
Run he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in
the Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had
been recently created by act of congress.The Sixteenth regiment was
attached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle,
and Cat.Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day,
being shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded
at the first battle of Bull Run.As soon as the news was received in
St.Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon.Henry Acker, left for
Pittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his
martyred son and bring the body back to St.His body was easily
found, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the
Second Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after
the battle.Paul they were met at
the steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to
Masonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral.The
funeral obsequies were held at St.Paul's church on Sunday, May 4,
1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that
had ever attended a funeral in St.Paul, many being present from
Minneapolis, St.The respect shown to the
memory of Capt.Acker was universal, and of a character which fully
demonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St.When the first Grand Army post was formed in St.Paul a name
commemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the
organization.Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the
cause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the
heroic Capt.Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first
association of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as
Acker post.*       *       *       *       *

The terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been
assassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of
April 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling
announcement that had been made during the long crisis through which
the country had just passed.No tongue
could find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the
fiendish act.It was not
safe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred
president.At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity
more deeply felt than in St.All public and private buildings
were draped in mourning.The
services at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long
be remembered by all those who were there.The church was heavily
draped in mourning.It had been suddenly transformed from a house of
hope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe.The pastor of the church
was the Rev.He was one of the most eloquent and
learned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the
Henry Ward Beecher of the Northwest.The members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic.Many of
their number were at the front defending their imperiled country.Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the
eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring
a vigorous prosecution of the war.During the darkest days of the
Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the
Union seemed furthest off, Mr.Noble never faltered; he believed that
the cause was just and that right would finally triumph.When the
terrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet
had ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was
so paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating.Every member of the
congregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly
taken from them.The services at the church on the Sunday morning
following the assassination were most solemn and impressive.The
little edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor
was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed.He
was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony.With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with
almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent
and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience.Had the dead
body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity
of the occasion could not have been greater.In the discourse that
followed, Mr.Noble briefly sketched the early history of the
president, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had
accomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair.For more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the
progress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight,
when it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender
of Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war,
he was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin."With malice
towards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right,
as God gives us to see the right," were utterances then fresh from the
president's lips.To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed
a crime most horrible.There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience.It was supposed at the time that Secretary
of State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger.It was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice
president and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt
prove fatal.Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the
time.His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign
entanglements during the long and bitter struggle.He, too, was
eulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly
mournful.Since that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by
the hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was
terrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal
as when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of
Abraham Lincoln.AN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE

       *       *       *       *       *

IN TWO CHAPTERS.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST.As the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful
summer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have
been seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the
North Star State to the Gulf of Mexico.He was on a mission of peace
and good will to the red men of the distant forest.On nearing the
shore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed
on discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years
preceded him.he muttered to himself; "methinks I see a
paleface toying with a dusky maiden.On
approaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation
the voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to
the paleface by her side."From the stars I see in the firmament, the
fixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future
destiny of man.This elixer
which I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for
countless generations.The possession of it will enable thee to
conquer all thine enemies.Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground
upon which some day a great city will be erected.Thou art destined to
become the mighty chief of this great metropolis.Thy reign will be
long and uninterrupted.Thou wert born when the conjunction of the
planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude.As the years roll
away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity.Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will
often come before thee for adjustment.To be successful In thy calling
thou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any
subject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in
the advocacy of their various schemes.Thou must not antagonize either
side by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and
the gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and
thou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the
scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies
or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded
lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of
relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O
Robert.thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed
party that the result would have been far different had not thou been
called suddenly away.Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all
parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere
adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people.When the
requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone
to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the
lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will
come to thy aid.Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their
displeasure will mean thy downfall.Let all the ends thou aimest at be
to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the
followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the
stars in their orbits."After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky
maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the
paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness
and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY.After the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the
frigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man.A
wonderful change met the eye.A transformation as magnificent as it
was bewildering had occurred.The same grand old bluffs looked proudly
down upon the Father of Water.The same magnificent river pursued
its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean.The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of
civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side.Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great
Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the
rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared
on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the
eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's
nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded "St.Paul's
finest" before leaving the shores of his native land.In the midst of
this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity
of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the
Okons, was the high and mighty ruler.The Okons and the followers of
the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the
paleface.Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an
immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic
words: "For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith," Verily the prophecy of the
dusky maiden had been fulfilled.The paleface had become impregnably
intrenched.The Okons could never be dislodged.With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,
the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more
seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.*       *       *       *       *

When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in
one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern
part of Pennsylvania.It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that
locality.The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known
to-day.Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments
possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up
to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War
to-day.It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to
acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under
the peculiar conditions existing at that period.A school district
that was able to support a school for six months in each year was
indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were
not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services
were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in
those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better
class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a
geography or grammar, but they were regarded as "stuck up," and the
other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far
beyond their capacity.Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December
and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart
each week for a spelling-match and recitation.We had our spelling
match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with
schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest.I was
considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling
matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great
four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to
one of the great contests.One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country
crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to
participate.As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle
the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride
without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to
the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal.While
the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to
starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet
as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination.I had not
considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance.As
soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers
were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them
was from our school.I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place
and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers.When
they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the
fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless.The school-master
from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from
his seat and said:

"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our
school."My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the
foot of the column.I felt very grateful towards our master for his
compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the
line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct.The
school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,
and I inwardly rejoiced.After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had
fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word
"phthisic."My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's
lips.It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling
book.It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to
make way for the exercises to follow.As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I
felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.said the school-master, and my pulse beat
faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to
their seats.As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said "Next," I
could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly
spell the word.With a clear and
distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room
I spelled out "ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.""Correct," said the
school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he
laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:
"I told you he could spell."I had spelled down four schools, and my
reputation as a speller was established.Our school was declared to
have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever
after my name was not the last one to be called.On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the
composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth
anniversary of his connection with the paper.A dozen of the old
employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr.Moore at an informal
dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event.Moore's service
on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer
Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which
eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press.He has held his
present position as the head of the composing room for about forty
years.Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St.Paul from Tioga
county, Pa., where he was born.He came with his brother, George W.
Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian.His
brother had been East and brought the boy West with him.Moore's
first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St.There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his
brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a
printer's "devil."It is interesting in these days of water works and
telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the
office.He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now
stands.Another of his jobs was to meet the boats.Whenever a steamer
whistled Mr.Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the
boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office.It was from these
papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world.He also
was half the carrier staff of the paper.His territory covered all
the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill
was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh
street.When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr.Moore went with
it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr.His service has been continuous,
excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war.The
Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest.Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more
notable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that
to-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as
efficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man
when things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the
beginning.Successive managements found that his services always gave
full value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and
devotion to the interests of the paper.Successive generations of
employes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure
to have as a fellow workman.To this, the Parson made no reply, thinking, probably, that he had
carried the joke far enough, and not wishing to provoke a quarrel with
his companion."As to the affair of the cave," said Jones Bradley; "I think very much
as Old Ropes does about it.I'm opposed to troubling the dead, and I
believe there's them buried there that don't want to be disturbed by
us, and if we don't mind the warning they give us, still the worse for
us.""The captain don't seem to be very much alarmed about it," said the
Parson; "for he stays in the cave.And, then, there's the Indian woman
and the darkey; the ghost don't seem to trouble them much.""I'll say this for Captain Flint," remarked Old Ropes, "if ever I
knowed a man that feared neither man nor devil, that man is Captain
Flint; but his time'll come yet.""You don't mean to say you see breakers ahead, do you?""Not in the way of our business, I don't mean," said Ropes; "but, I've
had a pretty long experience in this profession, and have seen the
finishing up of a good many of my shipmates; and I never know'd one
that had long experience, that would not tell you that he had been put
more in fear by the dead than ever he had by the living.""We all seem to be put in low spirits by this afternoon," said the
Parson; "s'pose we go below, and take a little something to cheer us
up."To this the others assented, and all three went below.All Captain Flint's efforts to unravel the mysteries of the cave were
unsuccessful; and he was reluctantly obliged to give up the attempt,
at least for the present; but, in order to quiet the minds of the
crew, he told them that he had discovered the cause, and that it was
just what he had supposed it to be.As everything remained quiet in the cave for a long time after this,
and the minds of the men were occupied with more important matters,
the excitement caused by it wore off; and, in a while, the affair
seemed to be almost forgotten.And here we may as well go back a little in our narrative, and restore
the chain where it was broken off a few chapters back.When Captain Flint had purchased the schooner which he commanded, it
was with the professed object of using her as a vessel to trade with
the Indians up the rivers, and along the shore, and with the various
seaports upon the coast.To this trade it is true, he did to some extent apply himself, but
only so far as it might serve as a cloak to his secret and more
dishonorable and dishonest practices.Had Flint been disposed to confine himself to the calling he pretended
to follow, he might have made a handsome fortune in a short time, but
that would not have suited the corrupt and desperate character of the
man.He was like one of those wild animals which having once tasted blood,
have ever afterward an insatiable craving for it.It soon became known to a few of the merchants in the city, among the
rest Carl Rosenthrall, that Captain Flint had added to his regular
business, that of smuggling.This knowledge, however, being confined to those who shared the
profits with him, was not likely to be used to his disadvantage.After a while the whole country was put into a state of alarm by the
report that a desperate pirate had appeared on the coast.Several vessels which had been expected to arrive with rich cargoes
had not made their appearance, although the time for their arrival had
long passed.There was every reason to fear that they had been
captured by this desperate stranger who had sunk them, killing all on
board.The captain of some vessels which had arrived in safety reported
having been followed by a suspicious looking craft.They said she was a schooner about the size of one commanded by
Captain Flint, but rather longer, having higher masts and carrying
more sail.No one appeared to be more excited on the subject of the pirate, than
Captain Flint.He declared that he had seen the mysterious vessel, had
been chased by her, and had only escaped by his superior sailing.Several vessels had been fitted out expressly for the purpose of
capturing this daring stranger, but all to no purpose; nothing could
be seen of her.For a long time she would seem to absent herself from the coast, and
vessels would come and go in safety.Then all of a sudden, she would
appear again and several vessels would be missing, and never heard
from more.The last occurrence of this kind is the one which we have already
given an account of the capturing and sinking of the vessel in which
young Billings had taken passage for Europe.We have already seen how Hellena Rosenthrall's having accidentally
discovered her lover's ring on the finger of Captain Flint, had
excited suspicions of the merchant's daughter, and what happened to
her in consequence.Captain Flint having made it the interest of Rosenthrall to keep his
suspicions to himself if he still adhered to them, endeavored to
convince him that his daughter was mistaken, and that the ring however
much it might resemble the one belonging to her lover, was one which
had been given to him by his own mother at her death, and had been
worn by her as long as he could remember.This explanation satisfied, or seemed to satisfy the merchant, and the
two men appeared to be as good friends as ever again.The sudden and strange disappearance of the daughter of a person of so
much consequence as Carl Rosenthrall, would cause no little excitement
in a place no larger than New York was at the time of which we write.Most of the people agreed in the opinion with the merchant that the
girl had been carried off by the Indian Fire Cloud, in order to avenge
himself for the insult he had received years before.As we have seen,
Captain Flint encouraged this opinion, and promised that in an
expedition he was about fitting out for the Indian country, he would
make the recovery of the young woman one of his special objects.Flint knew all the while where Fire Cloud was to be found, and fearing
that he might come to the city ignorant as he was of the suspicion he
was laboring under, and thereby expose the double game he was playing,
he determined to visit the Indian in secret, under pretence of putting
him on his guard, but in reality for the purpose of saving himself.He sought out the old chief accordingly, and warned him of his danger.Fire Cloud was greatly enraged to think that he should be suspected
carrying off the young woman."He hated her father," he said, "for he was a cheat, and had a crooked
tongue.But the paleface maiden was his friend, and for her sake he
would find her if she was among his people, and would restore her to
her friends.""If you enter the city of the palefaces, they will hang you up like a
dog without listening to anything you have to say in your defence,"
said Flint."The next time Fire Cloud enters the city of the palefaces, the maiden
shall accompany him," replied the Indian.This was the sort of an answer that Flint wished, and expected, and he
now saw that there was no danger to be apprehended from that quarter.But if Captain Flint felt himself relieved from danger in this
quarter, things looked rather squally in another.If he knew how to
disguise his vessel by putting on a false bow so as to make her look
longer, and lengthen the masts so as to make her carry more sail, he
was not the only one who understood these tricks.And one old sailor
whose bark had been chased by the strange schooner, declared that she
very much resembled Captain Flint's schooner disguised in this way.And then it was observed that the strange craft was never seen when
the captain's vessel was lying in port, or when she was known to be up
the river where he was trading among the Indians.Another suspicious circumstance was, that shortly after the strange
disappearance of a merchant vessel, Flint's schooner came into port
with her rigging considerably damaged, as if she had suffered from
some unusual cause.Flint accounted for it by saying that he had been
fired into by the pirate, and had just escaped with the skin of his
teeth.These suspicions were at first spoken cautiously, and in whispers
only, by a very few.They came to the ears of Flint himself at last, who seeing the danger
immediately set about taking measures to counteract it by meeting and
repelling, what he pretended to consider base slanders invented by his
enemies for the purpose of effecting his ruin.He threatened to prosecute the slanderers, and if they wished to see
how much of a pirate he was, let them fit out a vessel such as he
would describe, arm her, and man her according to his directions, give
him command of her, and if he didn't bring that blasted pirate into
port he'd never return to it himself.He'd like no better fun than to
meet her on equal terms, in an open sea.This bragadocia had the desired effect for awhile; besides, although
it could hardly be said that Flint had any real friends, yet there
were so many influential men who were concerned with him in some of
his contraband transactions.These dreaded the exposure to themselves,
should Flint's real character be discovered, which caused them to
answer for him in the place of friends.These men would no doubt be the first to crush him, could they only do
so without involving themselves in his ruin.But all this helped to convince Flint that his time in this part of
the country was pretty near up, and if he meant to continue in his
present line of business, he must look out for some new field of
operations.More than ever satisfied on this point, Captain Flint anxiously
awaited the arrival of the vessel, the capture of which was to be the
finishing stroke of his operations in this part of the world.When Captain Flint had decided to take possession of the cavern, and
fit it up as a place of retreat and concealment for himself and his
gang, he saw the necessity of having some one whom he could trust to
take charge of the place in his absence.A moment's reflection
satisfied him there was no one who would be more likely to serve him
in this capacity than the Indian woman who had rescued him from the
fearful fate he had just escaped.Lightfoot, who in her simplicity, looked upon him as a great chief,
was flattered by the proposal which he made her, and immediately took
charge of the establishment, and Captain Flint soon found that he had
no reason to repent the choice he had made, so far as fidelity to his
interests was concerned.For a while at first he treated her with as much kindness as it was in
the nature of such as he to treat any one.He may possibly have felt some gratitude for the service she had
rendered him, but it was self-interest more than any other feeling
that caused him to do all in his power to gain a controling influence
over her.He loaded her with presents of a character suited to her uncultivated
taste.Her person fairly glittered with beads, and jewelry of the most gaudy
character, while of shawls and blankets of the most glaring colors,
she had more than she knew what to do with.This course he pursued until he fancied he had completely won her
affection, and he could safely show himself in his true character
without the risk of loosing his influence over her.His manner to her now changed, and he commenced treating her more as a
slave than an equal, or one to whom he felt himself under obligations.It is true he would now and then treat her as formerly, and would
occasionally make her rich presents, but it would be done in the way
that the master would bestow a favor on a servant.Lightfoot bore this unkind treatment for some time without resenting
it, or appearing to notice it.Thinking perhaps that it was only a
freak of ill-humor that would last but for a short time, and then the
great chiefs attachment would return.Flint fancied that he had won the heart of the Indian woman, and
acting on the presumption that "love is blind," he thought that he
could do as he pleased without loosing hold on her affections.He had only captured the woman's
fancy.So that when Lightfoot found this altered manner of the captain's
towards her was not caused by a mere freak of humor, but was only his
true character showing itself, her fondness for him, if fondness it
could be called, began to cool.Things had come to this pass, when Hellena Rosenthrall was brought
into the cave.The first thought of Lightfoot was that she had now discovered the
cause of the captain's change of manner towards her.He had found
another object on which to lavish his favors and here was her rival.And she was to be the servant, the slave of this new favorite.Flint, in leaving Hellena in charge of Lightfoot, gave strict charges
that she should be treated with every attention, but that she should
by no means be allowed to leave the cave.The manner of Lightfoot to Hellena, was at first sullen: and reserved,
and although she paid her all the attention that Hellena required of
her, she went no further.But after awhile, noticing the sad countenance of her paleface sister,
and that her face was frequently bathed in tears, her heart softened
toward her, and she ventured to ask the cause of her sorrow.And when
she had heard Hellena's story, her feelings towards her underwent an
entire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot
pledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make
her take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so
without endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since
her capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in
the person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be
perfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,
his admiration for her could hardly have been greater.He could not
keep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though
generally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,
as to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts
of kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black
Bill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the
narrative.When it was finished, and Hellena's eyes were filled with
tears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:

"Don't cry, don't cry misses, de debble's comin arter massa Flint
berry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de
white angel."This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the
<DW64>, expressed as it was in such a strange manner, brought a smile
to the face of the maiden, notwithstanding the affliction which was
crushing her to the earth."Why Bill," said Hellena, "you don't mean to say you ever saw the
devil here, do you?""Never seed him, but heer'd him doe, sometimes," replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means
free from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and
witches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of
considerable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:

"I hope there ain't any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.""No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to
Hellena) or Lightfoot," said the Indian woman."The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of
spirits come back here sometimes.""Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime," replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, "are they not my friends?"Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena's curiosity, as well as her fears
were excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,
commenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to
the cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:

She said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had
put foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land
for a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a
great nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in
the bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough
to contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not
utterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for
bravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted
as much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land
was overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was
because they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to
them in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal
chiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit
would speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,
every thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said
he would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him
that they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if
he persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and
told them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great
Spirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose
of frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a
great brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to
him, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country
of all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his
own, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then
he laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into
the magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to
say.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came
out sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,
and his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation
scattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.But by
this time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united
against him as a common enemy.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste, as
theirs had been laid waste before.And the war was carried on for many years, until the prophesy was
fulfilled that had been spoken by the Great Spirit, and the people of
this once mighty nation were scattered to the four winds.This people as a great nation are known no longer, but a remnant still
remains scattered among the other tribes.Occasionally some of them
visit this cave, to whom alone its mysteries are known, or were,
Lightfoot said, until she had brought Captain Flint there in order to
escape their pursuers."Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard
there since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the
spirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back
from the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the
friends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of
Hellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a
dreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to
her imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly
be placed in.CHAPTER X.


When there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of
Lightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the
cavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night
following the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad
history of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl's sleep would be very
sound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob
goblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking
over the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and
expecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its
appearance in the shape of an enormous Indian in his war paint, and
his hands reeking with blood.After a while she fell into a doze in which she had a horrid dream,
where all the things she had been thinking of appeared and took form,
but assuming shapes ten times more horrible than any her waking
imagination could possibly have created.She had started from one of these horrid dreams,
and afraid to go to sleep again, lay quietly gazing around the cavern
on the ever varying reflections cast by the myriads of crystals that
glittered upon the wall and ceiling.Although there were in some portions of the cavern walls chinks or
crevices which let in air, and during some portion of the day a few
straggling sunbeams, it was found necessary even during the day to
keep a lamp constantly burning.And the one standing on the table in
the centre of the cave was never allowed to go out.As we have said, Hellena lay awake gazing about her.A perfect stillness reigned in the cave, broken only by the rather
heavy breathing of the Indian woman who slept soundly.Suddenly she heard, or thought she heard a slight grating noise at the
further side of the cavern.or does she actually
see the wall of the cavern parting?Such actually seems to be the
case, and from the opening out steps a figure dressed like an Indian,
and bearing in his hand a blazing torch.Hellena's tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth, and her limbs are
paralyzed with terror.The figure moves about the room with a step as noiseless as the step
of the dead, while the crystals on the walls seem to be set in motion,
and to blaze with unnatural brilliancy as his torch is carried from
place to place.He carefully examines everything as he proceeds; particularly the
weapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take
his fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined
it.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and
gazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white
maiden.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as
stealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and
everything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences
of the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed
were real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.The horrible
spectres which she had seen in the fore part of the night seemed like
those which visit us in our dreams when our minds are troubled.But
the apparition of the Indian seemed more real.or were the two
scenes only different parts of one waking vision?To this last opinion she seemed most inclined, and was fully confirmed
in the opinion that the cavern was haunted.Although Hellena was satisfied in her own mind that the figure that
had appeared so strangely was a disembodied spirit, yet she had a
vague impression that she had somewhere seen that form before.But
when, or where, she could not recollect.When in the morning she related the occurrences of the night to
Lightfoot, the Indian expressed no surprise, and exhibited no alarm.Nor did she attempt to offer any explanation seeming to treat it as a
matter of course.Although this might be unsatisfactory to Hellena in some respects, it
was perhaps after all, quite as well for her that Lightfoot did not
exhibit any alarm at what had occurred, as by doing so she imparted
some of her own confidence to her more timid companion.All this while Black Bill had not been thought of but after a while he
crawled out from his bunk, his eyes twice their usual size, and coming
up to Hellena, he said:

"Misses, misses, I seed do debble last night wid a great fire-brand in
his hand, and he went all round de cabe, lookin' for massa Flint, to
burn him up, but he couldn't fine him so he went away agin.Now I know
he's comin' after massa Flint, cause he didn't touch nobody else.""No; but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at
me, but he didn't say noffen, so I know'd it wasn't dis darkey he was
after."This statement of the <DW64>'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been
dreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the
horrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took
a lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could
discover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass
through, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing
like what she was in search of.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any
other entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had
entered.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that
she might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the
dark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following
day, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous
night, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as
something called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story
made up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Or perhaps invented for the purpose of arousing his superstition in
order to make him leave the cave, and take her to some place where
escape would be more easy.So she concluded to say nothing to him about it.About a week after the occurrence of the events recorded in the last
chapter, Captain Flint and his crew were again assembled in the
cavern.It was past midnight, and they evidently had business of
importance before them, for although the table was spread as upon the
former occasion, the liquors appeared as yet to be untasted, and
instead of being seated around the table, the whole party were sitting
on skins in a remote corner of the cavern, and conversing in a
suppressed tone of voice as if fearful of being heard."Something must be done," said one of the men, "to quiet this darn
suspicion, or it's all up with us.""I am for leaving at once," said Old Ropes; "the only safety for us
now is in giving our friends the slip, and the sooner we are out of
these waters the better it will be for us.""What, and leave the grand prize expecting to take care of itself?""Darn the prize," said Old Ropes, "the East Indiaman ain't expected
this two weeks yet, and if the suspicions agin us keep on increasin'
as they have for the last ten days, the land pirates'll have us all
strung up afore the vessel arrives."This opinion was shared by the majority of the men.Even the Parson
who took delight in opposing Old Ropes in almost every thing, agreed
with him here."Whether or not," said he, "I am afraid to face death in a fair
business-like way, you all know, but as sure as I'm a genuine parson,
I'd rather be tortured to death by a band of savage Indians, than to
be strung up to a post with my feet dangling in the air to please a
set of gaping fools.""Things do look rather squally on shore, I admit," said the captain,
"but I've hit upon a plan to remedy all that, and one that will make
us pass for honest men, if not saints, long enough to enable us to
finish the little job we have on hand.""Why, merely to make a few captures while we are lying quietly in the
harbour or a little way up the river.That'll turn the attention of
the people from us in another direction, in the mean while, we can
bide our time."We must man a whale boat or two and
attack some one of the small trading vessels that are coming in every
day.She must be run on the rocks where she may be examined
afterwards, so that any one may see that she has falling in the hands
of pirates.None of the crew must be allowed to escape, as that would
expose the trick."All this must take place while I am known to be on shore, and the
schooner lying in port."This plot, which was worthy the invention of a fiend, was approved by
all but Jones Bradley who declared that he would have nothing to do
with it.For which disobedience of orders he would have probably been
put to death had he been at sea.The plan of operations having been decided upon, the whole party
seated themselves round the table for the purpose as they would say of
making a night of it.But somehow or other they seemed to be in no humor for enjoyment, as
enjoyment is understood by such characters.A gloom seemed to have settled on the whole party.They could not even get their spirits up, by pouring spirits down.And although they drank freely, they drank for the most part in
silence.shouted captain Flint, "at last have we all lost our
voices?Can no one favor us with a song, or toast or a yarn?"Hardly had these words passed the lips of the captain, when the
piteous moan which had so startled the pirates, on the previous
evening again saluted them, but in a more suppressed tone of voice.The last faint murmurs of this moan had not yet died away, when a
shout, or rather a yell like an Indian war whoop, rang through the
cavern in a voice that made the very walls tremble, its thousand
echoes rolling away like distant thunder.The whole group sprang to their feet aghast.The two woman followed by Black Bill, terror stricken, joined the
group.This at least might be said of Hellena and the <DW64>.The latter
clinging to the skirts of the white maiden for protection, as a mortal
in the midst of demons might be supposed to seek the protection of an
Angel.Captain Flint, now laying his hand violently on Lightfoot, said, "What
does all this mean?do you expect to frighten me by your juggling
tricks, you infernal squaw?"At these words he gave her a push that
sent her staggering to the floor.In a moment he saw his mistake, and went to her assistance (but she
had risen before he reached her,) and endeavored to conciliate her
with kind words and presents.He took a gold chain from his pocket, and threw it about her neck, and
drew a gold ring from his own finger and placed it upon hers.These attentions she received in moody silence.All this was done by Flint, not from any feelings of remorse for the
injustice he had done the woman, but from a knowledge of how much he
was in her power and how dangerous her enmity might be to him.Finding that she was not disposed to listen to him, he turned from her
muttering to himself:

"She'll come round all right by and by," and then addressing his men
said:

"Boys, we must look into this matter; there's something about this
cave we don't understand yet.There may be another one over it, or
under it.He did not repeat the explanation he had given before, feeling no
doubt, that it would be of no use.A careful examination of the walls of the cave were made by the whole
party, but to no purpose.Nothing was discovered that could throw any
light upon the mystery, and they were obliged to give it up.And thus they were compelled to let the matter rest for the present.When the morning came, the pirates all left with the exception of the
captain, who remained, he said, for the purpose of making further
investigations, but quite as much for the purpose of endeavoring to
find out whether or not, Lightfoot had anything to do with the
production of the strange noises.But here again, he was fated to
disappointment.The Indian could not, or would not, give any
satisfactory explanation.The noises she contended were made by the braves of her nation who had
gone to the spirit world, and who were angry because their sacred
cavern had been profaned by the presence of the hated palefaces.Had he consulted Hellena, or Black Bill, his investigations would
probably have taken a different turn.The figure of the Indian having been seen by both Hellena and the
black, would have excited his curiosity if not his fears, and led him
to look upon it as a more serious matter than he had heretofore
supposed.But he did not consult either of them, probably supposing them to be a
couple of silly individuals whose opinions were not worth having.If any doubt had remained in the minds of the men in regard to the
supernatural character of the noises which had startled them in the
cave, they existed no longer.Even the Parson although generally ridiculing the idea of all sorts of
ghosts and hobgoblins, admitted that there was something in this
affair that staggered him, and he joined with the others in thinking
that the sooner they shifted their quarters, the better."Don't you think that squaw had a hand in it?"asked one of the men:
"didn't you notice how cool she took it all the while?""That's a fact," said the Parson; "it's strange I didn't think of that
before.I shouldn't wonder if it wasn't after all, a plot contrived by
her and some of her red-skinned brethren to frighten us out of the
cave, and get hold of the plunder we've got stowed away there."Some of the men now fell in with this opinion, and were for putting it
to the proof by torturing Lightfoot until she confessed her guilt.The majority of the men, however, adhered to the original opinion that
the whole thing was supernatural, and that the more they meddled with
it, the deeper they'd get themselves into trouble."My opinion is," said Old Ropes, "that there's treasure buried there,
and the whole thing's under a charm, cave, mountain, and all.""If there's treasure buried there," said the Parson, "I'm for having a
share of it.""The only way to get treasure that's under charm," said Old Ropes, "is
to break the charm that binds it, by a stronger charm.""It would take some blasting to get at treasure buried in that solid
rock," said Jones Bradley."If we could only break the charm that holds the treasure, just as
like as not that solid rock would all turn into quicksand," replied
Old Ropes."No; but I've seen them as has," replied Old Ropes."And more than that," continued Old Ropes, "my belief is that Captain
Flint is of the same opinion, though he didn't like to say so."I shouldn't wonder now, if he hadn't some charm he was tryin', and
that was the reason why he stayed in the cave so much.""I rather guess the charm that keeps the captain so much in the cave
is a putty face," dryly remarked one of the men.While these things had been going on at the cavern, and Captain Flint
had been pretending to use his influence with the Indians for the
recovery of Hellena, Carl Rosenthrall himself had not been idle in the
meantime.He had dealings with Indians of the various tribes along the river,
and many from the Far North, and West, and he engaged them to make
diligent search for his daughter among their people, offering tempting
rewards to any who would restore her, or even tell him to a certainty,
where she was to be found.In order to induce Fire Cloud to restore her in case it should prove
it was he who was holding her in captivity, he sent word to that
chief, that if he would restore his child, he would not only not have
him punished, but would load him with presents.These offers, of course made through Captain Flint, who it was
supposed by Rosenthrall, had more opportunities than any one else of
communicating with the old chief.How likely they would have been to reach the chief, even if he had
been the real culprit, the reader can guess.In fact he had done all in his power to impress the Indian that to put
himself in the power of Rosenthrall, would be certain death to him.Thus more than a month passed without bringing to the distracted
father any tidings of his missing child.We may as well remark here, that Rosenthrall had lost his wife many
years before, and that Hellena was his only child, so that in losing
her he felt that he had lost everything.The Indians whom he had employed to aid him in his search, informed
him that they could learn nothing of his daughter among their people,
and some of them who were acquainted with Fire Cloud, told him that
the old chief protested he knew nothing of the matter.Could it be that Flint was playing him false?He could hardly think that it was Flint himself who had stolen his
child, for what motive could he have in doing it?The more he endeavored to unravel the mystery, the stranger and more
mysterious it became.Notwithstanding the statements to the contrary made by the Indians,
Flint persisted in giving it as his belief, that Fire Cloud had
carried off the girl and was still holding her a prisoner.He even
said that the chief had admitted as much to him.Yet he was sure that
if he was allowed to manage the affair in his own way, he should be
able to bring the Indian to terms.It was about this time that the dark suspicions began to be whispered
about that Captain Flint was in some way connected with the horrible
piracies that had recently been perpetrated on the coast, if he were
not in reality the leader of the desperate gang himself, by whom they
had been perpetrated.Those suspicions as we have seen, coming to Flint's own ears, had
caused him to plan another project still more horrible than the one he
was pursuing, in order to quiet those suspicions until he should have
an opportunity of capturing the rich prize which was to be the
finishing stroke to his achievements in this part of the world.The suspicions in regard to Captain Flint had reached the ears of
Rosenthrall, as well as others, who had been secretly concerned with
him in his smuggling transactions, although in no way mixed up with
his piracies.Rosenthrall feared that in case these suspicions against Flint should
lead to his arrest, the whole matter would come out and be exposed,
leading to the disgrace if not the ruin, of all concerned.It was therefore with a feeling of relief, while joining in the
general expression of horror, that he heard of a most terrible piracy
having been committed on the coast.Captain Flint's vessel was lying
in port, and he was known to be in the city.There was one thing too connected with this affair that seemed to
prove conclusively, that the suspicions heretofore harboured against
the captain were unjust.And that was the report brought by the crew of a fishing smack, that
they had seen a schooner answering to the description given of the
pirate, just before this horrible occurrence took place.Captain Flint now assumed the bearing of a man whose fair fame had
been purified of some foul blot stain that had been unjustly cast upon
it, one who had been honorably acquitted of base charges brought
against him by enemies who had sought his ruin.He had not been ignorant, he said, of the dark suspicions that had
been thrown out against him.But he had trusted to time to vindicate his character, and he had not
trusted in vain.Among the first to congratulate Captain Flint on his escape from the
danger with which he had been threatened, was Carl Rosenthrall.He admitted that he had been to some extent, tainted with suspicion,
in common with others, for which he now asked his forgiveness.The pardon was of course granted by the captain, coupled with hope
that he would not be so easily led away another time.The facts in regard to this last diabolical act of the pirates were
these.Captain Flint, in accordance with the plan which he had decided upon,
and with which the reader has already been made acquainted, fitted out
a small fishing vessel, manned by some of the most desperate of his
crew, and commanded by the Parson and Old Ropes.Most of the men went on board secretly at night, only three men
appearing on deck when she set sail.In fact, no one to look at her, would take her for anything but an
ordinary fishing smack.They had not been out long, before they came in sight of a vessel
which they thought would answer their purpose.It was a small brig
engaged in trading along the coast, and such a vessel as under
ordinary circumstances they would hardly think worth noticing.But
their object was not plunder this time, but simply to do something
that would shield them from the danger that threatened them on shore.The time seemed to favor them, for the night was closing in and there
were no other vessels in sight.On the pirates making a signal of distress, the commander of the brig
brought his vessel to, until the boat from the supposed smack could
reach him, and the crew could make their wants known.To his surprise six men fully armed sprang upon his deck.To resist this force there were only himself, and two men, all
unarmed.Of these the pirates made short work not deigning to answer the
questions put to them by their unfortunate victims.When they had murdered all on board, and thrown overboard such of the
cargo as they did not want they abandoned the brig, knowing from the
direction of the wind, and the state of the tide, that she would soon
drift on the beach, and the condition in which she would be found,
would lead people to believe that she had been boarded by pirates, and
all on board put to death.After having accomplished this hellish act, they turned their course
homeward, bringing the report that they had seen the notorious
piratical schooner which had committed so many horrible depredations,
leading every one to conclude that this was another of her terrible
deeds.Captain Flint, satisfied with the result of this last achievement,
felt himself secure for the present.He could now without fear of interruption, take time to mature his
plans for carrying out his next grand enterprise, which was to be the
crowning one of all his adventures, and which was to enrich all
engaged in it.Captain Flint's plan for the accomplishment of his last grand
enterprise was, as soon as it should be announced to him by those he
had constantly on the lookout, that the expected vessel was in sight,
to embark in a large whale boat which he had secretly armed, and
fitted for the purpose.After killing the crew of the vessel they expected to capture, he
would tack about ship, and take her into some port where he could
dispose of the vessel and cargo.As, in this case, it was his intention to abandon the country for
ever, he removed under various pretences, all his most valuable
property from the cavern.The schooner he was to leave in charge of Jones Bradley, under
pretence that it was necessary to do so, in order to divert suspicion
from him when the thing should have been accomplished.The fact was, that as he should have no further use for the schooner,
and having for some time past, feared that Bradley seemed to be too
tender-hearted to answer his purpose, he had determined to abandon him
and the schooner together.At last, news was brought to Captain Flint that a vessel answering the
one they were expecting was in sight.Flint who, with his crew of desperators, was lying at a place now
known as Sandy Hook, immediately started in pursuit.The doomed ship was making her
way under a light breeze apparently unconscious of danger.There was one thing about the ship, that struck the pirates as rather
unusual.There seemed to be more hands on board than were required to
man such a vessel."I'm afraid there's more work for us than we've bargained for," said
one of the men."They seem to have a few passengers on board," remarked Flint, "but we
can soon dispose of them."The principal part of Flint's men had stretched themselves on the
bottom of the boat for fear of exciting the suspicion of those on
board the ship by their numbers.As the pirate craft approached the merchant man, apparently with no
hostile intention, those on board the ship were watching the boat as
closely as they were themselves watched.As soon as they came within hailing distance, the man at the bow of
the boat notified the captain of the ship that he wished to come along
side, as he had something of importance to communicate.The captain of the ship commenced apparently making preparations to
receive the visit, when one of the men on deck who had been observing
the boat for some time came to him and said:

"That's he.The man on the bow of the
boat is the notorious pirate Flint."In a moment more they would be along side, and nothing could prevent
them from boarding the ship.In that moment the captain of the ship, by a skilful movement suddenly
tacked his vessel about just as the pirates came up, coming in contact
with the boat in such a manner as to split her in two in a moment.A dozen men sprung up from the bottom of the boat, uttering horrid
curses while they endeavored to reach the ship or cling to portions of
their shattered boat.The greater portion of them were drowned, as no efforts were made to
rescue them.Three only succeeded in reaching the deck of the ship in safety, and
these would probably have rather followed their comrades had they
known how few were going to escape.These three were Captain Flint, the one called the Parson and Old
Ropes.These were at first disposed to show fight, but it was of no use.Their arms had been lost in their struggle in the water.They were soon overpowered and put in irons.Great was the excitement caused in the goodly little City of New York,
by the arrival of the merchant ship bringing as prisoners, the daring
pirate with two of his men whose fearful deeds had caused all the
inhabitants of the land to thrill with horror.And great was the surprise of the citizens to find in that terrible
pirate a well-known member of the community, and one whom nearly all
regarded as a worthy member of society.Another cause of surprise to the good people of the city, was the
arrival by this vessel, of one whom all had long given up as lost, and
that was Henry Billings, the lover of Hellena Rosenthrall.He it was who had recognized in the commander of the whale boat, the
pirate Flint, and had warned the captain of the ship of his danger,
thereby enabling him to save his vessel, and the lives of all on
board.Captain Flint made a slight mistake when he took the vessel by which
he was run down, for the India man he was looking out for.It was an
ordinary merchant ship from Amsterdam, freighted with merchandise from
that port.Though in appearance she very much resembled the vessel
which Captain Flint had taken her for.The reason young Billings happened to be on board of her was this:

It will be remembered that when the ship in which Billings had taken
passage for Europe, was attacked by the pirates, he was forced to walk
the plank.By the pirates, he was of course supposed to have been drowned, but in
this they were mistaken.He had been in the water but a few moments
when he came in contact with a portion of a spar which had probably
come from some wreck or had been washed off of some vessel.To this he lashed himself with a large handkerchief which it was his
good fortune to have at the time.Lashed to this spar he passed the night.When morning came he found that he had drifted out to sea; he could
not tell how far.He was out of sight of land, and no sail met his anxious gaze.His strength was nearly exhausted, and he felt a stupor coming over
him.How long he lay in this condition he could not tell.When he came to
himself, he found that he was lying in the birth of a vessel, while a
sailor was standing at his side.He had been discovered by the Captain of a ship bound for England,
from Boston.He had been taken on board, in an almost lifeless condition, and
kindly cared for.In a little while he recovered his usual strength, and although his
return home must necessarily be delayed, he trusted to be enabled
before a great while to do so and bring to justice the villains who
had attempted his murder.Unfortunately the vessel by which he had been rescued, was wrecked on
the coast of Ireland, he and the crew barely escaping with their
lives.After a while, he succeeded in getting to England by working his
passage there.From London, he made his way in the same manner, to Amsterdam, where
the mercantile house with which he was connected being known, he found
no difficulty in securing a passage for New York.Billings now for the first time heard the story of Hellena's
mysterious disappearance.It immediately occurred to him that Captain Flint was some way
concerned in the affair not withstanding his positive denial that he
knew anything of the matter further than he had already made known.The capture of Captain Flint, and the other two pirates of course led
to the arrest of Jones Bradley who had been left in charge of the
schooner.He was found on board of the vessel, which was lying a short distance
up the river, and arrested before he had learned the fate of his
comrades.He was cast into prison with the rest, though each occupied a separate
cell.As no good reason could be given for delaying the punishment of the
prisoners, their trial was commenced immediately.The evidence against them was too clear to make a long trial
necessary.They were all condemned to death with the exception of Jones Bradley,
whose punishment on account of his not engaged in last affair, and
having recommended mercy in the case of Henry Billings, was committed
to imprisonment for life.When the time came for the carrying out of sentence of the three who
had been condemned to death, it was found that one of them was missing
and that one, the greatest villain of them all, Captain Flint himself!No one had visited him on the previous
day but Carl Rosenthrall, and he was a magistrate, and surely he would
be the last one to aid in the escape of a prisoner!That he was gone however, was a fact.But If it were a fact that he had made his escape, it was equally
true, that he could not have gone very far, and the community were not
in the humor to let such a desperate character as he was now known to
be, escape without making a strenuous effort to recapture him.The execution of the two who had been sentenced to die at the same
time, was delayed for a few days in the hope of learning from them,
the places where Flint would most probably fly to, but they maintained
a sullen silence on the subject.They then applied to Jones Bradley with, at first, no better result.But when Henry Billings, who was one of those appointed to visit him,
happened to allude to the strange fate of Hellena Rosenthrall, he
hesitated a moment, and then said he knew where the girl was, and that
she had been captured by Captain Flint, and kept in close confinement
by him.He had no wish he said to betray his old commander, though he knew
that he had been treated badly by him, but he would like to save the
young woman.Captain Flint might be in the same place, but if he was, he thought
that he would kill the girl sooner than give her up.If Captain Flint, was not there, the only ones in the cave besides the
girl, were a squaw, and Captain Flint's <DW64> boy, Bill.For the sake of the girl Bradley said he would guide a party to the
cave.This offer was at once accepted, and a party well armed, headed by
young Billings, and guided by Jones Bradley, set out immediately.When Captain Flint made his escape from prison, it naturally enough
occurred to him, that the safest place for him for awhile, would be
the cave.In it he thought he could remain in perfect safety, until he should
find an opportunity for leaving the country.The cave, or at least the secret chamber, was unknown to any except
his crew, and those who were confined in it.On leaving the cave, the last time, with a heartlessness worthy a
demon, he had barred the entrance to the cavern on the outside, so as
to render it impossible for those confined there to escape in that
direction.In fact, he had, be supposed, buried them alive--left them to die of
hunger.Captain Flint reached the entrance of the cave in safety, and found
everything as he had left it.On reaching the inner chamber where he had left the two women and the
<DW64> boy, he was startled to find the place apparently deserted,
while all was in total darkness, except where a few rays found their
way through the crevices of the rocks.He called the names first of one, and then another, but the only
answer he received was the echo of his own voice.They certainly could not have made their escape, for the fastenings
were all as he had left them.The means of striking fire were at hand, and a lamp was soon lighted.He searched the cave, but could discover no trace of the missing ones.A strange horror came over him, such as he had never felt before.The stillness oppressed him; no living enemy could have inspired him
with the fear he now felt from being alone in this gloomy cavern."I must leave this place," he said, "I would rather be in prison than
here."Again he took up the lamp, and went round the cave, but more this time
in hopes of finding some weapon to defend himself with, in case he
should be attacked, than with the hope of discovering the manner in
which those he had left there had contrived to make their escape.It had been his custom, lately, on leaving the cavern, to take his
weapons with him, not knowing what use might be made of them by the
women under the provocation, to which they were sometimes subjected.The only weapon he could find was a large dagger.This he secured, and
was preparing to leave the cavern, when he thought he saw something
moving in one corner.In order to make sure that he had not been mistaken, he approached the
place.It was a corner where a quantity of skins had been thrown, and which
it had not been convenient for him to remove, when he left the cavern.Thinking that one of these skins might be of service to him in the
life he would be obliged to live for some time, he commenced sorting
them over, for the purpose of finding one that would answer his
purpose, when a figure suddenly sprang up from the pile.It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more frightened."Dat you, massa," at length exclaimed the familiar voice of Black
Bill."I tought it was de debil come back agin to carry me off."said Flint, greatly relieved, and glad to
find some one who could explain the strange disappearance of Hellena
and Lightfoot.he asked; "where's the white girl and the
Indian woman?""Debble carry dim off," said Bill."What do you mean, you black fool?"said his master; "if you don't
tell me where they've gone, I'll break your black skull for you.""Don't know where dar gone," said Bill, tremblingly, "Only know dat de
debble take dem away."Flint finding that he was not likely to get anything out of the boy by
frightening him, now changed his manner, saying;

"Never mind, Bill, let's hear all about it."The boy reassured, now told his master that the night before while he
was lying awake near the pile of skins and the women were asleep, he
saw the walls of the cavern divide and a figure holding a blazing
torch such as he had never seen before, enter the room."I tought," said Bill, "dat it was de debble comin' arter you agin,
massa, and I was 'fraid he would take me along, so I crawled under de
skins, but I made a hole so dat I could watch what he was doin'.""He looked all round a spell for you, massa, an' when he couldn't find
you, den he went were de women was sleepin' an woke dem up and made
dem follow him."Den da called me and looked all ober for me an' couldn't find me, an'
de debble said he couldn't wait no longer, an' dat he would come for
me annudder time, An den de walls opened agin, an' da all went true
togedder.When I heard you in de cave, massa, I tought it was de
debble come agin to fetch me, an' so I crawled under de skins agin."From this statement of the boy, Flint come to the conclusion that Bill
must have been too much frightened at the time to know what was
actually taking place.One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had
been aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most
strange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the
same result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass
out through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,
for he found everything as he had left it.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled
and disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell
of enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in
the manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was
telling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even
though a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the
feeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon
entering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,
before taking his departure.This determination of Captain Flint's was by no means agreeable to the
<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the
clutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him
that he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the
captain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of
the cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day
passed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his
appearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the
cave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and
not to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,
however, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it
at all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no
disposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards
him, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much
longer, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go
in search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the
others to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was
barred against her from the outside.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of
the captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they
immediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by
that means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,
and endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold
ring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain
Flint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look
at it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by
her lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was
satisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden
disappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this
villain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now
desirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time
before sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when
Hellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure
she had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a
spectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, "has the little paleface
maiden forgotten; no, no!"she recognized in the intruder, her old
friend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing
her arms around the old chief, exclaimed:

"Save me, no, no, save me!"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the
appearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she
had expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a
place of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in
charge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And
she recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He
was also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with
all the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and
bade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for
the first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to
perish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was
called to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go
without him, the chief promising to return and make another search for
him, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under
the pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might
be called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,
and stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a
sudden pressure, when a portion of the wall moved aside, disclosing a
passage, till then unknown to all except Fire Cloud himself.It was
one of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the
purpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed
after him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could
not see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over
the difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path
widening until it might be called another cavern, and then again
becoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they
suddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter's wand could
open the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the
passage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower
part, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and
making an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves
in the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one
unacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking
rock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the
mountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of
Indian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his
own hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find
herself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white
face to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a
stranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found
herself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling
himself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately
escaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to
persuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for
passing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in
sleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern
was the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would
certainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this
he would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him
also, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the
loud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast
asleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had
thrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the
captain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the
table, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards
the entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,
and the fastening could be easily removed.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit
of boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may
come arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain't a goun to ketch
dis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de
sea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might
be overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further
into the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the
devil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his
slumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a
crevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as
we have said had been carried off by the <DW64>."Hello, there, Bill, you black imp," shouted the captain, "bring a
light."But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times
repeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he
always kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place
of the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought
to have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in
silence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy
place, once more came over him."Who knows," he thought, "but this black imp may betray me into the
hands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his
power to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on
the outside, bury me alive!"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the
cavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard
the sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in
order to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,
who seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man
his old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the
cave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and
reconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of
everything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,
when Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, "So it's you, you
traitor, who has betrayed me," at the same moment plunging his dagger
in the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several
shots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the
advantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon
hidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident
that his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the
unfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,
and they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them
stumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang
Black Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had
discovered that he was among friends."Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?""Gone dat way, and a-runnin' as if de debble was arter him, an' I
guess he is, too."The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a
precipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low
growl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to
shrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were
in pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from
wounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?"De debble got him now," said Black Bill, and the whole party took
their way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in
company with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to
their coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the
devil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,
that they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his
mind not to return to the city, until he had learned something
definite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages
belonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had
come up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,
for the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,
occupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of
canoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt
to avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the
savages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to
trade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced
endeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their
astonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their
prisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their
course down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke
English tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that
he was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape
they had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and
they thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as
to bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of
their mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was
of no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently
his arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they
had made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for
having performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and
reproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And
Billings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left
for him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of
success were greatly against him this time, on account of the time
that had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this
delay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,
now came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing
maiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the
streams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while
traveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was
gladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered
to accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the
protection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must
travel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under
such a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian
country, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred
worth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the
remainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was
the residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father
of Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure
and disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted
in the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was
answered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of
his Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a
single canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of
Old Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man
somewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian
woman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,
Lightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,
but not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or
otherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being
delayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have
saved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her
father and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never
expected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena's happiness would now have been complete, had it
not been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled
by without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was
fast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the
one for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her
wonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did
we not think that justice to the reader, required that we should
explain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet
accounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she
had seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but
we have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so
alarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a
recess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>'s bed, there was a deep
fissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,
to amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,
when to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and
over, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,
which came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the
wall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of
times, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed
it to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, "The debil comin' after master," and repeated it a
great many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had
been talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,
Bill was lying awake, listening to the captain's story.When he came
to the part where he describes the throwing the boy's father
overboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the
crevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in
his memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had
learned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm
was caused by Fire Cloud after his visit to the cave on the occasion
that he had been taken for the devil by Bill, and an Indian ghost by
Hellena.Fire Cloud had remained in another chamber of the cavern connected
with the secret passage already described, and where the echo was even
more wonderful than the one pronounced from the opening through which
the <DW64> had spoken.Here he could hear all that was passing in the great chamber occupied
by the pirates, and from this chamber the echoes were to those who did
not understand their cause, perfectly frightful.All these peculiarities of the cavern had been known to the ancient
Indian priests or medicine men, and by them made use of to impose on
their ignorant followers.BEADLE'S FRONTIER SERIES

one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too much interested, though for very different reasons, to refuse; and
I succeeded in inducing them to conceal themselves in the two rooms from
which you saw them issue, knowing that if either of them had committed
this deed, he had done it for the love of Mary Leavenworth, and
consequently could not hear her charged with crime, and threatened
with arrest, without betraying himself.I did not hope much from the
experiment; least of all did I anticipate that Mr.Harwell would prove
to be the guilty man--but live and learn, Mr.A FULL CONFESSION


    "Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of a man,
    Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection."I AM not a bad man; I am only an intense one.Ambition, love, jealousy,
hatred, revenge--transitory emotions with some, are terrific passions
with me.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents
that make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and
relentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known
this.Often and often have I heard
her say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so
indifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;
called me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned
upon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,
laid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before
my foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me
Dough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even
less appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,
they thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and
feeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never
laughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed
heart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month
without showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more
than they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the
certainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others
had done.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,
to care for any man's opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead
level plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such
it might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house
for a seat in Mr.Leavenworth's library, a blazing torch fell into
my soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom
before me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new
employer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me
in her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning
flash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was
in one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a
passing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me
then.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look
unrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the
flower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination
were in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the
moment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the
emotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to
study her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way
of turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I
wished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being
that nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly
as now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;
I might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not
even turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,
months, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank
me for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as
I passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this
thought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth's dictation and pleased him.My
methodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the
family, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her
proud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,
but kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she
met every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was
none too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary
Leavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune
above every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in
the possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this
was, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became
convinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth's disposition almost as
perfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind
he would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills
something might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only
thing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the
man in whom she was interested.One
day--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:

"HOFFMAN HOUSE,

"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:

"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who
seems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can
give her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,
manner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and
your rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as
she is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the
rights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking
the spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don't believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who
and what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared
at my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name
signed to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself
was that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as
you know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I
stood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew
calm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually
the arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and
then and, by threatening to place it in her uncle's hand, won from her
a look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than
that.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to
win her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice
before she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided
to allow the letter to pass into my employer's hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without
exciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it
for what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into
the room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the
envelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents
and tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no
sign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked
at me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far
enough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,
devoured the remainder in silence.I waited a moment, then withdrew to
my own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently
rereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he
passed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I
saw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he
went directly to Mary's room, and when in a few hours later the family
collected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking
up, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him
and his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had
begun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its
relentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my
life blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert
and listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual
sound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;
I have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat
it here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my
statement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his
hand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact
which made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily
down-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my
account of the matter was true.a
forewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for
my own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable
gulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to
consider the possibilities which could make this the only path to
my elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending
gratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some
emergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I
must go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the
dizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated
visions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs
and entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my
employer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes
upon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would
be before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand
I did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with
him the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour
of action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,
I caught the sound of a lady's dress rustling through the hall, and
listening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the
library, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something
was going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed
necessary.Casting about in my mind
for the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running
up through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth's bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of
the large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of
the communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and
standing there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary
and her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of
vital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat
evidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change
his will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her
fault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her
declare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than
love; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free
from all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her
uncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I
was, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest
hope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle
reply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her
claims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry
of shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,
for me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own
room, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as
I had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen
myself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went
in.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,
and think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I
went for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the
pistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had
taken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary
Leavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching
the table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that
it was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my
pocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived
lying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was
done did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp
report must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of
the murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that
Mr.But I was saved from committing such
a folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed
to create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my
work undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid
detection.A moment's study of the wound made in his head by the
bullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as
a suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such
matters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one
hope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by
destroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the
pistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of
cleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the
handkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It
was Miss Eleanore's, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean
the barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me
I forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do
away with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a
purpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought
for means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by
thrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the
hope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I
reloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a
thunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I
locked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not
till I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it
was too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written
on every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking
at me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a
low tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned
suspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the
key into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I
have seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will
be disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,
I put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly
knew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which
came into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she
prepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two
previous tokens I had had of this girl's unreasonable susceptibility to
my influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and
made to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of
the great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming
way possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course
intensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position
evidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that
I did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it
was I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library
key in my hand."But I won't tell," she whispered, trembling violently
in her fright and eagerness.I will say I
didn't see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep
her secret if the police once began to question her, and, following
up my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in
winning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown
over.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her
comprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her
things.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some
day if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in
the face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently
possessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only
get to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would
keep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can't get there
to-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight
train did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to
the depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn't find
her way!She still hesitated, but
at length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the
method I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook's which I put on her, and in
another moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say
nothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in
parting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come
and marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about
my neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she
dropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till
now.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl
I can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the
additional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted
to dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street
or dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed
by the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot
everything else.Hannah's pale face, Hannah's look of terror, as she
turned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before
me.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was
less vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the
white face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in
something--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing
white and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the
morning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result
possible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that
little cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag
of danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would
come back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization
of the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my
possession.I dared not leave my room again,
or open my window.Indeed I was
afraid to move about in my room.Yes, my
morbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I
myself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful
to the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt
finally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from
my pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of
the two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till
it was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,
and nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it
to my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the
flitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I
have heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily
believe it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing
on the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her
sake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the
presence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose
calm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved
itself also.Instead of that I would
put them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being
overlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the
spare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,
went down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door
as I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me
made this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without
her knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the
second hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as
self-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,
looking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which
for a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,
thinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I
should proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and
afterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have
done if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key
or go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing
all the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow
of evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,
uncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer's nieces
was not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected
of the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed
all the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving
Mr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the
morning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I
resolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as
I could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that
they lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,
and that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary
Leavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference
was drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth's
glass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my
leaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in
her direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few
minutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made
by Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected
with the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an
instant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured
with the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more
plainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed
towards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began
to lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately
visible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the
burden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The
consequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been
given to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up
seemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth's own pistol had been used in the assassination,
and that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought
to acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while
before, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence
mischievous enough to have been of the devil's own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned
became very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my
ascent, Mary had gone to her uncle's room for the purpose of persuading
him not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what
consequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to
influence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not
only suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the
fact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or
less circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny
whatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore's generosity not to
be contradicted.Though, by the course
she took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife
against herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when
a true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,
a lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially
endeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration
and made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could
be given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have
led me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid
upon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us
all while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the
handkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their
destruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed
I immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to
the floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the
lighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary
Leavenworth's room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire
there in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there
were only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my
design, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming
up-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that
time, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But
in the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a
chair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching
steps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when
Eleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of
the staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight
reassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing
of it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further
word of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the
questionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in
me no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested
upon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the
inquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the
tragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute
proof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my
course would have been any different.Mary's peril was the one thing
capable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the
contrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance
of guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had
given one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized
as my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least
distrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,
lulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by
without suffering any fears on her account.But not without many
anxieties for myself.Hannah's existence precluded all sense of personal
security.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod
the verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had
lost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she
evince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of
her uncle's wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,
the characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of
winning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary
round in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have
I stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that
I could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it
up again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his
wonder at my sitting in my dead employer's chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I
was enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange
gentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth
in a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him
whisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may
say or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make
her mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,
maddening!I had either to yell in
my fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did
not dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung
caution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury
denounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had
I done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom
nothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a
superstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former
position without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague
doubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of
going any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that
for some reason Mr.But
that once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the
burden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe
that any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I
had not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,
in which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the
house on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not
hope to accomplish?While she remained
alive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy
her and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what
means could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with
her without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;
but Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without
result.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,
and I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her
into destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking
myself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she
having distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played
upon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling
her I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was
afraid she didn't, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would
use according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,
next to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow
the powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose
of poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely
criminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in
the corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to
agreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though
I had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt
that the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the
least particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal
results must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the
powder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my
letter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result
of my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch
of the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started
when the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short
paragraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least
produced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any
sense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,
and--let these prison walls, this confession itself, tell the rest.I am
no longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME


    "Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet

    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you
prepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks
and give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet
to you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,
for she looked ready to faint."I don't know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine
may differ.No news can be good but----"

"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to
have reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do
not be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become
a part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;
that she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
cousin the guilt of her uncle's death, her first words were a prayer to
be taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my
knees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,
procuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin's home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be
right!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like
this can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in
my suspicions.If you knew--"

"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"

"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
change.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
which the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
again."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
composed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she
crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when
it was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their
way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin's feet, and that
her cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin
against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:
"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that
the lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and
that, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were
in store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception
room, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary
standing on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,
I own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in
her haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly
murmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I
never thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by
my side."I have much to be grateful for; how
much I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What
I wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept
this fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or
would have been if--"

"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
subject somehow awakened.Is it your
determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin's hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
drawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
said:

"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow
me to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document
which ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,
the act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of
my mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever
indebted to you; if not----"

"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to
a past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as
possible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone
miseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
rejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
result.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted
to the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of
magnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its
unfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,
especially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
task of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been
now the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.He knew Ben's character; he had no
reason, after their interview, to suppose it was changed; and he could
not wrong his employers by permitting them ignorantly to engage a bad
boy, especially when he had been questioned directly on the point.Towards evening Harry was sent with a bundle to a place in Boylston
Street, which required him to cross the Common.On his return, when he
reached the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who had evidently
followed him, and lay in wait at this spot for him, sprang from his
covert upon him.The young villain struck him a heavy blow in the eye
before Harry realized his purpose.The blow, however, was vigorously
returned; but Ben, besides being larger and stronger than his victim,
had a large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a blow on the
side of his head, knocking him insensible to the ground.The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled along the side of
the walk of the burying ground, pursued by several persons who had
witnessed the assault.Ben was a fleet runner this time, and succeeded
in making his escape.CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEN HEAD MAY BE OF SOME USE TO A
PERSON


When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found himself in an
elegantly furnished chamber, with several persons standing around the
bed upon which he had been laid.A physician was standing over him,
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received in the side of
his head."There, young man, you have had a narrow escape," said the doctor, as
he saw his patient's eyes open.asked Harry, faintly, as he tried to concentrate his
wandering senses."You are in good hands, my boy.replied the sufferer, trying to
rise on the bed."Do you feel as though you could walk home?""I don't know; I feel kind of faint.""No, sir; it feels numb, and everything seems to be flying round."Harry expressed an earnest desire to go home, and the physician
consented to accompany him in a carriage to Mrs.He
had been conveyed in his insensible condition to a house in Boylston
Street, the people of which were very kind to him, and used every
effort to make him comfortable.A carriage was procured, and Harry was assisted to enter it; for he
was so weak and confused that he could not stand alone.Ben had struck
him a terrible blow; and, as the physician declared, it was almost a
miracle that he had not been killed.Flint and Katy were shocked and alarmed when they saw the
helpless boy borne into the house; but everything that the
circumstances required was done for him.he asked, when they had placed him on the bed."They will wonder what has become of me at the store," continued the
sufferer, whose thoughts reverted to his post of duty."I will go down to the store and tell them what has happened," said
Mr.Callender, the kind gentleman to whose house Harry had been
carried, and who had attended him to his home."Thank you, sir; you are very good.I don't want them to think that I
have run away, or anything of that sort.""They will not think so, I am sure," returned Mr.Callender, as he
departed upon his mission."Do you think I can go to the store to-morrow?"asked Harry, turning
to the physician."I am afraid not; you must keep very quiet for a time."He had never been sick a day in
his life; and it seemed to him just then as though the world could not
possibly move on without him to help the thing along.A great many
persons cherish similar notions, and cannot afford to be sick a single
day.I should like to tell my readers at some length what blessings come to
us while we are sick; what angels with healing ministrations for the
soul visit the couch of pain; what holy thoughts are sometimes kindled
in the darkened chamber; what noble resolutions have their birth in
the heart when the head is pillowed on the bed of sickness.But my
remaining space will not permit it; and I content myself with
remarking that sickness in its place is just as great a blessing as
health; that it is a part of our needed discipline.When any of my
young friends are sick, therefore, let them yield uncomplainingly to
their lot, assured that He who hath them in his keeping "doeth all
things well."Harry was obliged to learn this lesson; and when the pain in his head
began to be almost intolerable, he fretted and vexed himself about
things at the store.He was not half as patient as he might have been;
and, during the evening, he said a great many hard things about Ben
Smart, the author of his misfortune.I am sorry to say he cherished
some malignant, revengeful feelings towards him, and looked forward
with a great deal of satisfaction to the time when he should be
arrested and punished for his crime.Wade called upon him as soon as they heard of
his misfortune.They were very indignant when they learned that Harry
was suffering for telling the truth.They assured him that they should
miss him very much at the store, but they would do the best they
could--which, of course, was very pleasant to him.But they told him
they could get along without him, bade him not fret, and said his
salary should be paid just the same as though he did his work.Wade continued; "and, as it will cost you more to be sick,
we will raise your wages to four dollars a week."Certainly," replied the junior, warmly.There was no possible excuse for fretting now.With so many kind
friends around him, he had no excuse for fretting; but his human
nature rebelled at his lot, and he made himself more miserable than
the pain of his wound could possibly have made him.Flint, who
sat all night by his bedside, labored in vain to make him resigned to
his situation.It seemed as though the great trial of his lifetime had
come--that which he was least prepared to meet and conquer.His head ached, and the pain of his
wound was very severe.His moral condition was, if possible, worse
than on the preceding night.He was fretful, morose, and unreasonable
towards those kind friends who kept vigil around his bedside.Strange
as it may seem, and strange as it did seem to himself, his thoughts
seldom reverted to the little angel.Once, when he thought of her
extended on the bed of pain as he was then, her example seemed to
reproach him.She had been meek and patient through all her
sufferings--had been content to die, even, if it was the will of the
Father in heaven.With a peevish exclamation, he drove her--his
guardian angel, as she often seemed to him--from his mind, with the
reflection that she could not have been as sick as he was, that she
did not endure as much pain as he did.For several days he remained in
pretty much the same state.His head ached, and the fever burned in
his veins.His moral symptoms were not improved, and he continued to
snarl and growl at those who took care of him."Give me some cold water, marm; I don't want your slops," fretted he,
when Mrs."But the doctor says you mustn't have cold water."Give me a glass of cold water, and I will--"

The door opened then, causing him to suspend the petulant words; for
one stood there whose good opinion he valued more than that of any
other person.I am so sorry to see you so sick!"exclaimed Julia Bryant,
rushing to his bedside.She was followed by her father and mother; and Katy had admitted them
unannounced to the chamber.replied Harry, smiling for the first time since
the assault."Yes, Harry; I hope you are better.When I heard about it last night,
I would not give father any peace till he promised to bring me to
Boston.""Don't be so wild, Julia," interposed her mother."You forget that he
is very sick.""Forgive me, Harry; I was so glad and so sorry.I hope I didn't make
your head ache," she added, in a very gentle tone.It was very good of you to come and see me."Harry felt a change come over him the moment she entered the room.The
rebellious thoughts in his bosom seemed to be banished by her
presence; and though his head ached and his flesh burned as much as
ever, he somehow had more courage to endure them.Bryant had asked him a few questions, and expressed
their sympathy in proper terms, they departed, leaving Julia to remain
with the invalid for a couple of hours."I did not expect to see you, Julia," said Harry, when they had gone."Didn't you think I would do as much for you as you did for me?"I am only a poor boy, and you are a
rich man's child."You can't think how bad I
felt when father got Mr."It's a hard case to be knocked down in that way, and laid up in the
house for a week or two.""I know it; but we must be patient."I haven't any patience--not a bit.If I could get
hold of Ben Smart, I would choke him.I hope they will catch him and
send him to the state prison for life."These malignant words did not sound like those of
the Harry West she had known and loved.They were so bitter that they
curdled the warm blood in her veins, and the heart of Harry seemed
less tender than before."Harry," said she, in soft tones, and so sad that he could not but
observe the change which had come over her."No, I am sure you don't.asked he, deeply impressed by the sad and solemn
tones of the little angel."Forgive Ben Smart, after he has almost killed me?"Julia took up the
Bible, which lay on the table by the bedside--it was the one she had
given him--and read several passages upon the topic she had
introduced.The gentle rebuke she administered
touched his soul, and he thought how peevish and ill-natured he had
been."You have been badly hurt, Harry, and you are very sick.Now, let me
ask you one question: Which would you rather be, Harry West, sick as
you are, or Ben Smart, who struck the blow?""I had rather be myself," replied he, promptly."You ought to be glad that you are Harry West, instead of Ben Smart.Sick as you are, I am sure you are a great deal happier than he can
be, even if he is not punished for striking you."Here I have been
grumbling and growling all the time for four days.It is lucky for me that I am Harry, instead of Ben.""I am sure I have been a great deal better since I was sick than
before.When I lay on the bed, hardly able to move, I kept thinking
all the time; and my thoughts did me a great deal of good."Harry had learned his lesson, and Julia's presence was indeed an
angel's visit.For an hour longer she sat by his bed, and her words
were full of inspiration; and when her father called for her he could
hardly repress a tear as she bade him good night.Flint and Katy to forgive him for
being so cross, promising to be patient in the future.She read to him, conversed
with him about the scenes of the preceding autumn in the woods, and
told him again about her own illness.In the afternoon she bade him a
final adieu, as she was to return that day to her home.The patience and resignation which he had learned gave a favorable
turn to his sickness, and he began to improve.It was a month,
however, before he was able to take his place in the store again.Without the assistance of Julia, perhaps, he had not learned the moral
of sickness so well.As it was, he came forth from his chamber with
truer and loftier motives, and with a more earnest desire to lead the
true life.Ben Smart had been arrested; and, shortly after his recovery, Harry
was summoned as a witness at his trial.It was a plain case, and Ben
was sent to the house of correction for a long term.CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS
GREATEST TRIUMPH


Three years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim
through life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as "a
tale that is told."To note all the events of Harry's experience
through this period would require another volume; therefore I can only
tell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that
time.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were
overcome without care and privation.Often he failed, was often
disappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred
against the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things
which would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur
and influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,
causing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while
the body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew
older, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and
the object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an
attentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his
character was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and
tried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials
and temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he
associated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is
true, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and
dissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet
he had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a
salary of five dollars a week.Flint,
though Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient
to disgust his "fast" companion with the homely fare and homely
quarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight
dollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class
hotel.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the
Savings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully
watched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very
handsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended
them in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,
it was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the
poor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had
inherited, he might never have known that it was "more blessed to give
than to receive."As he grew older, and the worth of money was more
apparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care
of themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his
gifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no
more ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,
encouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a
year since he had been on a "spree."Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before
the event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of
his life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of
interest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had
first met the "little angel"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he
could not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he
first began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that
he had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom
of childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in
each, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence
between them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the
interference of the "powers" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing
sense of the "fitness of things" in the parties.But they occasionally
met, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety
demanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's
severest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and
his increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry
saw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard
him say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he
attended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore
a gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder
that he was "short."He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though
eight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his
expenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five
dollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he
was good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially
as Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the
occasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth
some excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he
obtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a
two-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a
further application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when
Edward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got
his money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to
dinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when
they had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as
rather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of
his employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, "we have been losing money from the store for
the last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times."exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a
confidant or as the suspected person."To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he
purchased some goods."Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself."I can form no idea, sir," returned Harry."I can only speak for
myself.""Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you," added Mr."I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to
keep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon."Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them
in such a way that they could be readily identified, and then
dismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles
Wallis were in close conversation."I say, Harry, what's in the wind?"asked the former, as our hero
returned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who
were very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much
alike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that
something unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen
spools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his
eye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he
knew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was
the guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any
result was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on
the fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal
of money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making
change, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he
forgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to
inform Mr."Only to the office," replied he; and his appearance and manner might
have attracted the attention of any skillful rogue."Come, Harry, don't leave your place," added Edward, playfully
grasping him by the collar, on his return."Don't stop to fool, Edward," answered Harry, as he shook him off and
took his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame
shook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very
unpleasant business."Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of
your pockets, Edward," said Mr."Certainly not, sir;" and he turned every one of his pockets inside
out.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,
for that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully
expected to convict the culprit on the spot."I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this," continued
Edward, with a sneer."I'll bet five dollars he stole the money
himself, if any has been stolen."Search me, sir, by all means," added Harry; and he began to turn his
pockets out.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop
bill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my
pocket.""But you seem to know more about it than Edward," remarked Mr.Wade,
as he took the parcel.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it
contained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to
condemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,
there was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that
our hero was the victim of a conspiracy."As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake," interposed
Edward, "I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My
mother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,
you will find more marked pieces."Wake, I'm innocent," protested Harry, when he had in some measure
recovered from the first shock of the heavy blow."I never stole a
cent from anybody.""I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this
money happened to be in your pocket?"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs."Don't let him go with you, though," said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the
money, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone."So you have been
watching me, I thought as much."Wade told me to do," replied Harry, exceedingly
mortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and
lay it to me!""I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it
possible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be
a thief?But your career is finished," said he, very sternly, as he
entered the office."Nothing strange to the rest of us," added Edward."I never knew one
yet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal."Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite," replied Harry, with
spirit."I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,
at Mrs.Flint's," said the senior, severely.Those half dollars were part of the money paid
him by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise."I
never borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid
him a cent."Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered
the monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but
the young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and
art that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were
against him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in
Leverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he
was not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon
that special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate
him from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say
when she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he
was sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced
when she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in
proportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name
was called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an
exclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and
monstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity
of the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner
saved him.Wake, he questioned him in
regard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the
most intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,
as the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the
lawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to
the prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's
counsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or
paid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's
arrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had
returned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in
relation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to
unmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to
pay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason
the fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He
produced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from
Edward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his
confusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his
coolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally
acknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close
questioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found
in Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the
shop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his
return from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the
thief.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he
had managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate
Harry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly
interposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy
termination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly
man elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood."Young man, what is your father's name?"he asked, in tones tremulous
with emotion."You had a father--what was his name?""Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to
Valparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from
him."exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while
the tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement."Is it possible that you are my father?""I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing
me that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I
met a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also."They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to
the store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed
that, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had
accomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which
had nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;
and since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing
to send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to
his wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of
the death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his
remaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a
condition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had
rendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his
remaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and
happened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son
who, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.Edward Flint finished his career of "fashionable dissipation" by being
sentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he
confessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,
three years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of
accompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.He was in exuberant
spirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly
realize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared
the joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how
astonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see
the spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his
father--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of
his life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through
trial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found
a rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is
in those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,
of his career have planted in his soul.CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN
END


Perhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's
subsequent life; and we will "drop in" upon him at his pleasant
residence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The
years have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant
discharge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return
to his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into
possession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him
to choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West
is quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time
at his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the
village, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from
the turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of
the charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two
nights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very
rock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel
brought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the
side of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the
events of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected
with the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or
gay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the
articles are rich and tasteful.Who is that
beautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?Do you not recognize her,
gentle reader?West, and an old
acquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell
her height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much
of an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in
the garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and
though he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks
he is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so
himself."This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and
see friend Nason," said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his
wife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's."Do you see that high rock, Julia?""That is the very one where I dodged Leman, and took the back track;
and there is where I knocked the bull-dog over."It is a pleasant little
cottage, for he is no longer in the service of the town.Connected with it is a fine farm of
twenty acres.Nason by his
protege, though no money was paid.Harry would have made it a free
gift, if the pride of his friend would have permitted; but it amounts
to the same thing.West and his lady are warmly welcomed by Mr.The ex-keeper is an old man now.He is a member of the church, and
considered an excellent and useful citizen.West
his "boy," and regards him with mingled pride and admiration.Our friends dine at the cottage; and, after dinner, Mr.West talk over old times, ride down to Pine Pleasant, and visit the
poorhouse.Squire Walker, Jacob
Wire, and most of the paupers who were the companions of our hero, are
dead and gone, and the living speak gently of the departed.At Pine Pleasant, they fasten the horse to a tree, and cross over to
the rock which was Harry's favorite resort in childhood."By the way, Harry, have you heard anything of Ben Smart lately?""After his discharge from the state prison, I heard that he went to
sea."They say she never smiled after she
gave him up as a hopeless case."I pity a mother whose son turns out badly.In their absence, a letter for Julia from Katy Flint
has arrived.Joe is a
steady man, and, with Harry's assistance, has purchased an interest in
the stable formerly kept by Major Phillips, who has retired on a
competency.asked Harry, as she broke the seal."Yes; he has just been sent to the Maryland penitentiary for
housebreaking.""Katy says her mother feels very badly about it."Flint is an excellent woman; she was a mother to
me.""She says they are coming up to Rockville next week.""Glad of that; they will always be welcome beneath my roof.I must
call upon them to-morrow when I go to the city.""Do; and give my love to them."And, here, reader, I must leave them--not without regret, I confess,
for it is always sad to part with warm and true-hearted friends; but
if one must leave them, it is pleasant to know that they are happy,
and are surrounded by all the blessings which make life desirable, and
filled with that bright hope which reaches beyond the perishable
things of this world.It is cheering to know that one's friends, after
they have fought a hard battle with foes without and foes within, have
won the victory, and are receiving their reward.If my young friends think well of Harry, let me admonish them to
imitate his virtues, especially his perseverance in trying to do well;
and when they fail to be as good and true as they wish to be, to TRY
AGAIN.THE END

NEW YORK, N. Y.Was it serious or was it
assumed?Had this seemingly sudden resolve only the failure of Royster
& Axtell behind it, or was there a woman there, as well?Was Elaine
Cavendish the real reason?There could be no doubt of Croyden's
devotion to her--and her more than passing regard for him.Was it
because he could not, or because he would not--or both?Croyden was
practically penniless--she was an only child, rich in her own right,
and more than rich in prospect----

"Will you dine with me, this evening?""Sorry, old man, but I'm due at the Cavendishes'--just a pick-up by
telephone.I shall see you, again, shan't I?"Have
breakfast with me in the morning--if I'm not too early a bird, at eight
o'clock.""I'll speak to Francois," said Macloud, arising.Croyden slowly straightened his tie and drew on his coat."Macloud is a square chap," he reflected."I've had a lot of so-called
friends, here, but he is the only one who still rings true.I may
imagine it, but I'm sure the rest are beginning to shy off.Well, I
shan't bother them much longer--they can prepare for a new victim."He picked up his hat and went downstairs, making his way out by the
front entrance, so as to miss the crowd in the grill-room.He did not
want the trouble of speaking or of being spoken to.He saw Macloud, as
he passed--out on the piazza beyond the porte-cochere, and he waved his
hand to him.Then he signalled the car, that had been sent from
Cavencliffe for him, and drove off to the Cavendishes.II

GOOD-BYE


The Cavendishes were of those who (to quote Macloud's words) "did
belong and, thank God, showed it."Henry Cavendish had married
Josephine Marquand in the days before there were any idle-rich in
Northumberland, and when the only leisure class were in jail.Now, when
the idea, that it was respectable not to work, was in the ascendency,
he still went to his office with unfailing regularity--and the fact
that the Tuscarora Trust Company paid sixty per cent.on its capital
stock, and sold in the market (when you could get it) at three thousand
dollars a share, was due to his ability and shrewd financiering as
president.It was because he refused to give up the active management
even temporarily, that they had built their summer home on the Heights,
where there was plenty of pure air, unmixed with the smoke of the mills
and trains, and with the Club near enough to give them its life and
gayety when they wished.The original Cavendish and the original Marquand had come to
Northumberland, as officers, with Colonel Harmer and his detachment of
Regulars, at the close of the Revolution, had seen the possibilities of
the place, and, after a time, had resigned and settled down to
business.Having brought means with them from Philadelphia, they
quickly accumulated more, buying up vast tracts of Depreciation lands
and numerous In-lots and Out-lots in the original plan of the town.These had never been sold, and hence it was, that, by the natural rise
in value from a straggling forest to a great and thriving city, the
Cavendish and the Marquand estates were enormously valuable.And hence,
also, the fact that Elaine Cavendish's grandparents, on both sides of
the house, were able to leave her a goodly fortune, absolutely, and yet
not disturb the natural descent of the bulk of their possessions.Having had wealth for generations, the Cavendishes were as natural and
unaffected in their use of it, as the majority of their neighbors were
tawdry and flashy.They did things because they wanted to do them, not
because someone else did them.And they did not do things that others
did, and never thought what the others might think.Because an iron-magnate, with only dollars for ballast, had fifteen
bath pools of Sienna marble in his flaunting, gaudy "chateau," and was
immediately aped by the rest of the rattle-brained, moved the
Cavendishes not at all.Because the same bounder gave a bathing-suit
party (with the ocean one hundred and fifty miles away), at which
prizes were bestowed on the man and woman who dared wear the least
clothes, while the others of the _nouveaux riches_ applauded and
marvelled at his audacity and originality, simply made the Cavendishes
stay away.Because another mushroom millionaire bought books for his
library by the foot, had gold mangers and silver stalls for his horses,
and adorned himself with diamonds like an Indian Rajah, were no
incentives to the Cavendishes to do likewise.They pursued the even
tenor of the well-bred way.Cavencliffe was a great, roomy country-house, in the Colonial style,
furnished in chintz and cretonnes, light and airy, with wicker
furniture and bird's-eye maple throughout, save in the dining-room,
where there was the slenderest of old Hepplewhite.Wide piazzas flanked
the house on every side, screened and awninged from the sun and wind
and rain.A winding driveway between privet hedges, led up from the
main road half a mile away, through a maze of giant forest trees amid
which the place was set.Croyden watched it, thoughtfully, as the car spun up the avenue.He saw
the group on the piazza, the waiting man-servant, the fling upward of a
hand in greeting by a white robed figure."It's a bully place, and
a bully girl--and, I think, I had a chance, if I hadn't been such a
fool."Elaine Cavendish came forward a little way to greet him.And Croyden
sighed, again, as--with the grace he had learned as a child from his
South Carolina mother, he bent for an instant over her hand.He had
never known how handsome she was, until this visit--and he had come to
say good-bye!"You were good to come," she said."It was good of you to ask me," he replied.The words were trite, but there was a note of intenseness in his tones
that made her look sharply at him--then, away, as a trace of color came
faintly to her cheek."You know the others," she said, perfunctorily.And Croyden smiled in answer, and greeted the rest of the guests.Chichester, a young matron, of less
than thirty, whose husband was down in Panama explaining some contract
to the Government Engineers; Nancy Wellesly, a rather petite blonde,
who was beginning to care for her complexion and other people's
reputations, but was a square girl, just the same; and Charlotte
Brundage, a pink and white beauty, but the crack tennis and golf player
of her sex at the Club and a thorough good sport, besides.The men were: Harold Hungerford, who was harmlessly negative and
inoffensively polite; Roderick Colloden, who, after Macloud, was the
most popular man in the set, a tall, red haired chap, who always seemed
genuinely glad to meet anyone in any place, and whose handshake gave
emphasis to it.He had not a particularly good memory for faces, and
the story is still current in the Club of how, when he had been
presented to a newcomer four times in one week, and had always told him
how glad he was to meet him, the man lost patience and blurted out,
that he was damn glad to know it, but, if Colloden would recognize him
the next time they met, he would be more apt to believe it.The
remaining member of the party was Montecute Mattison.He was a small
man, with peevishly pinched features, that wore an incipient smirk when
in repose, and a hyena snarl when in action.He had no friends and no
intimates.He was the sort who played dirty golf in a match:
deliberately moving on the green, casting his shadow across the hole,
talking when his opponent was about to drive, and anything else to
disconcert.In fact, he was a dirty player in any game--because it was
natural.He would not have been tolerated a moment, even at the
Heights, if he had not been Warwick Mattison's son, and the heir to his
millions.He never made an honest dollar in his life, and could not, if
he tried, but he was Assistant-Treasurer of his father's company, did
an hour's work every day signing the checks, and drew fifteen thousand
a year for it.A man's constant inclination was to smash him in the
face--and the only reason he escaped was because it would have been
like beating a child.One man had, when Mattison was more than
ordinarily offensive, laid him across his knee, and, in full sight of
the Club-house, administered a good old-fashioned spanking with a golf
club.The others did not take the
trouble, however.They simply shrugged their shoulders, and swore at
him freely and to his face.At present, he was playing the devoted to Miss Brundage and hence his
inclusion in the party.She cared nothing for him, but his money was a
thing to be considered--having very little of her own--and she was
doing her best to overcome her repugnance sufficiently to place him
among the eligibles.Mattison got through the dinner without any exhibition of ill nature,
but, when the women retired, it came promptly to the fore.The talk had turned on the subject of the Club Horse Show.It was
scheduled for the following month, and was quite the event of the
Autumn, in both a social and an equine sense.The women showed their
gowns and hosiery, the men their horses and equipment, and how
appropriately they could rig themselves out--while the general herd
stood around the ring gaping and envious.Presently, there came a momentary lull in the conversation and Mattison
remarked:

"I see Royster & Axtell went up to-day.I reckon," with an insinuating
laugh, "there will be some entries withdrawn.""Both--and men who haven't horses, as well," with a sneering glance at
Croyden."I am not responsible for the direction of Mr.Mattison's eyes,"
Croyden answered with assumed good nature."I knew, of course, you were hit,
but I hoped it was only for a small amount.""If you haven't any
appreciation of propriety, you can at least keep quiet.""Oh, I don't know----"

"Don't you?"said Colloden, quietly, reaching across and grasping him
by the collar."Think again,--_and think quickly_!"A sickly grin, half of surprise and half of anger, overspread
Mattison's face."Can't you take a little pleasantry?""We don't like your pleasantries any more than we like you, and that is
not at all.He shook him, much as
a terrier does a rat, and jammed him back into his chair."Now, either
be good or go home," he admonished.Mattison was weak with anger--so angry, indeed, that he was helpless
either to stir or to make a sound.The others ignored him--and, when he
was a little recovered, he got up and went slowly from the room."It wasn't a particularly well bred thing to do," observed Colloden,
"but just the same it was mighty pleasant.If it were not for the law,
I'd have broken his neck.""He isn't worth the exertion, Roderick," Croyden remarked."But I'm
obliged, old man.When they rejoined the ladies on the piazza, a little later, Mattison
had gone.After a while, the others went off in their motors, leaving Croyden
alone with Miss Cavendish.Hungerford had offered to drop him at the
Club, but he had declined.He would enjoy himself a little
longer--would give himself the satisfaction of another hour with her,
before he passed into outer darkness.He had gone along in his easy, bachelor way, without a serious thought
for any woman, until six months ago.Then, Elaine Cavendish came home,
after three years spent in out-of-the-way corners of the globe, and,
straightway, bound him to her chariot wheels.At least, so the women said--who make it their particular business to
observe--and they never make mistakes.They can tell when one is
preparing to fall in love, long before he knows himself.Indeed, there
have been many men drawn into matrimony, against their own express
inclination, merely by the accumulation of initiative engendered by
impertinent meddlers.They want none of it, they even fight desperately
against it, but, in the end, they succumb.And Geoffrey Croyden would have eventually succumbed, of his own
desires, however, had Elaine Cavendish been less wealthy, and had his
affairs been more at ease.Now, he thanked high Heaven he had not
offered himself.She might have accepted him; and think of all the
heart-burnings and pain that would now ensue, before he went out of her
life!"What were you men doing to Montecute Mattison?""He appeared perfectly furious when he came out, and he went off
without a word to anyone--even Charlotte Brundage was ignored.""He and Colloden had a little difficulty--and Mattison left us,"
Croyden answered."Didn't he stop to say good-night?""He called something as he drove off--but I think
he was swearing at his man.""He needed something to swear at, I fancy!""Took him by the collar and shook him--and told him either to go home
or be quiet.""Yes--when he had recovered himself sufficiently.I thought, at first,
his anger was going to choke him.""Imagine big, good-natured Roderick stirred sufficiently to lay hands
on any one!""But imagine him _when_ stirred," he said."I hadn't thought of him in that way," she said, slowly--"Ough!"with a
little shiver, "it must have been terrifying--what had Mattison done to
him?""Nothing--Mattison is too much of a coward ever to _do_ anything.""Oh, some brutality about one of Colloden's friends, I think," Croyden
evaded."I didn't quite hear it--and we didn't discuss it afterward.""I'm told he is a scurrilous little beast, with the men," she
commented; "but, I must say, he is always polite to me, and reasonably
charitable.Indeed, to-night is the only deliberately bad manners he
has ever exhibited.""He knows the men won't hurt him," said Croyden, "whereas the women, if
he showed his ill nature to them, would promptly ostracize him.He is
a canny bounder, all right.""We have had
enough of Mattison--let us find something more interesting--yourself, for
instance."Which reminds
me--Miss Southard is coming to-morrow; you will be over, of course?""I'm going East to-morrow night," he said."But she is to stay two weeks--you will be back before she leaves,
won't you?""I fear not--I may go on to London.""I've been anticipating it for some time," sending a cloud of cigarette
smoke before his face."But it grew imminent only to-day."When the smoke faded, her eyes were looking questioningly into his.There was something in his words that did not ring quite true.It was
too sudden to be genuine, too unexpected.It struck her as vague and
insincere.Yet there was no occasion to mistrust--it was common enough
for men to be called suddenly to England on business.----

"When do you expect to return?""I do not know," he said, reading something that was in her mind."If I
must go, the business which takes me will also fix my return."Pride's Crossing wishes to talk with
you."Croyden arose--it was better to make the farewell brief--and
accompanied her to the doorway."Good-bye," he said, simply."Yes--there are some things that must be done to-night.""Good-bye, then--and _bon voyage_," she said, extending her hand.He took it--hesitated just an instant--lifted it to his lips--and,
then, without a word, swung around and went out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

The next day--at noon--when, her breakfast finished, she came down
stairs, a scare headline in the morning's paper, lying in the hall, met
her eyes.Royster Found Dead in His Bath-room!ROYSTER & AXTELL FAIL!Many Prominent Persons Among the Creditors.She seized the paper, and nervously ran her eyes down the columns until
they reached the list of those involved.----

Yes!And Croyden read it, too, as he sped Eastward toward the unknown life.III

CLARENDON


Croyden left Northumberland in the morning--and his economy began with
the ride East: he went on Day Express instead of on the Limited,
thereby saving the extra fare.At Philadelphia he sent his baggage to
the Bellevue-Stratford; later in the evening, he had it returned to the
station, and checked it, himself, to Hampton--to avoid the possibility
of being followed by means of his luggage.He did not imagine that any one would go to the trouble to trace him,
but he was not taking any chances.He wanted to cut himself away,
utterly, from his former life, to be free of everyone he had ever
known.Some one would say: "I haven't seen Croyden lately," would be answered:
"I think he went abroad suddenly--about the time of the Royster &
Axtell failure," and, with that, he would pass out of notice.If he
were to return, any time within the next five years, he would be met by
a languid: "Been away, somewhere, haven't you?I thought I hadn't
noticed you around the Club, lately."--And that would be the extent of
it.His going and his coming are not
watched.There is no time to bother with another's affairs.Everyone
has enough to do to look after his own.The curiosity about one's
neighbors--what he wears, what he eats, what he does, every item in his
daily life--that is developed by idleness, thrives in littleness, and
grows to perfection in scandal and innuendo--belongs solely to the
small town.If one comes down street with a grip--instantly: So and so
is "going away"--speculation as to why?--where?--what?One puts on a
new suit, it is observed and noted.--A pair of new shoes, ditto.--A new
necktie, ditto.Every particular of his life is public property, is
inspected for a motive, and, if a motive cannot be discovered, one is
supplied--usually mean and little, the latter unctuously preferred.All this Croyden was yet to learn, however.He took the night's express on the N. Y., P.& N., whence, at Hampton
Junction, he transferred to a branch line.For twenty miles the train
seemed to crawl along, burrowing into the sand hills and out again into
sand, and in and out again, until, at length, with much whistling and
escaping steam, they wheezed into the station and stopped.There were a dozen white men, with slouch hats and nondescript
clothing, standing aimlessly around, a few score of <DW64>s, and a
couple of antique carriages with horses to match.The white men looked
at the new arrival, listlessly, and the <DW64>s with no interest at
all--save the two who were porters for the rival hotels.They both made
for Croyden and endeavored to take his grip."I don't want your hotel, boys," he said."But if you can tell me where
Clarendon is, I will be obliged."yass, seh," said one, "right out at de een' o' de
village, seh--dis street tek's yo dyar, seh, sho nuf.""Dis een', seh, de fust house beyon' Majah Bo'den's, seh.""'Tain't no blocks--it's jest de fust
place beyon' Majah Bo'den's.""Here," he said, "you take my bag out to
Clarendon--I'll walk till I find it."but yo bettah ride, seh!"said Croyden, looking at the vehicle.He tossed the <DW64> a quarter and turned away."Thankee, seh, thankee, seh, I'll brings it right out, seh."Croyden went slowly down the street, while the crowd stared after him,
and the shops emptied their loafers to join them in the staring.He was
a strange man--and a well-dressed man--and they all were curious.Presently, the shops were replaced by dwellings of the humbler sort,
then they, in turn, by more pretentious residences--with here and there
a new one of the Queen Anne type.Croyden did not need the information,
later vouchsafed, that they belong to _new_ people.It was as
unmistakable as the houses themselves.About a mile from the station, he passed a place built of English
brick, covered on the sides by vines, and shaded by huge trees.It
stood well back from the street and had about it an air of aristocracy
and exclusiveness."I wonder if this is the Bordens'?"said Croyden looking about him for
some one to ask--"Ah!"Down the path from the house was coming a young woman.He slowed down,
so as to allow her to reach the entrance gates ahead of him.She was
pretty, he saw, as she neared--very pretty!--positively beautiful!dark
hair and----

He took off his hat."Yes--this is Major Borden's," she answered, with a deliciously soft
intonation, which instantly stirred Croyden's Southern blood."Then Clarendon is the next place, is it not?"She gave him the quickest glance of interest, as she replied in the
affirmative."Colonel Duval is dead, however," she added--"a caretaker is the only
person there, now."There was no excuse for detaining her longer.he ended, bowed slightly, and went on.It is ill bred and rude to stare back at a woman, but, if ever Croyden
had been tempted, it was now.He heard her footsteps growing fainter in
the distance, as he continued slowly on his way.Something behind him
seemed to twitch at his head, and his neck was positively stiff with
the exertion necessary to keep it straight to the fore.He wanted another look at that charming figure, with the mass of blue
black hair above it, and the slender silken ankles and slim tan-shod
feet below.He remembered that her eyes were blue, and that they met
him through long lashes, in a languidly alluring glance; that she was
fair; and that her mouth was generous, with lips full but delicate--a
face, withal, that clung in his memory, and that he proposed to see
again--and soon.He walked on, so intent on his visual image, he did not notice that the
Borden place was behind him now, and he was passing the avenue that led
into Clarendon.hyar yo is, marster!--hyar's Clarendon," called the <DW64>,
hastening up behind him with his bag.Croyden turned into the walk--the black followed."Cun'l Duval's done been daid dis many a day, seh," he said."Folks sez
ez how it's owned by some city fellah, now.Mebbe yo knows 'im, seh?"Croyden did not answer, he was looking at the place--and the <DW64>,
with an inquisitively curious eye, relapsed into silence.The house was very similar to the Bordens'--unpretentious, except for
the respectability that goes with apparent age, vine clad and tree
shaded.It was of generous proportions, without being large--with a
central hall, and rooms on either side, that rose to two stories, and
was topped by a pitch-roof.There were no piazzas at front or side,
just a small stoop at the doorway, from which paths branched around to
the rear."I done'speck, seh, yo go roun' to de back," said the <DW64>, as
Croyden put his foot on the step."Ole Mose 'im live dyar.I'll bring
'im heah, ef yo wait, seh.""Who is old Mose--the caretaker?"The place was looked after by a real estate man of the village, and
neither his father nor he had bothered to do more than meet the
accounts for funds.The former had preferred to let it remain
unoccupied, so as to have it ready for instant use, if he so wished,
and Croyden had done the same.Mose he's Cun'l Duval's body-survent, seh.Him an'
Jos'phine--Jos'phine he wif', seh--dey looks arfter de place sence de
ole Cun'l died."They followed the right hand path, which seemed to be more used than
its fellow.The servants' quarters were disclosed at the far end of the
lot.Before the tidiest of them, an old <DW64> was sitting on a stool,
dreaming in the sun.At Croyden's appearance, he got up hastily, and
came forward--gray-haired, and bent.he said, with the remains of what once must have been a
wonderfully graceful bow, and taking in the stranger's attire with a
single glance.Cun'l Duval's boy--seh, an' I looks
arfter de place, now.De Cun'l he's daid, yo knows, seh.What can I do
fur yo, seh?"the <DW54> answered, inquiringly.It was evident the name conveyed no meaning to him."I'm the new owner, you know--since Colonel Duval died," Croyden
explained.So yo's de new marster, is yo?I'm
pow'ful glad yo's come, seh!What mout yo name be, seh?""Now, Moses, will you open the house and
let me in?""Coz why, seh--I'm beggin' yo pa'den, seh, but Marster Dick sez, sez
he, 'Don' nuvver lets no buddy in de house, widout a writin' from me.'I ain' doubtin' yo, seh, 'deed I ain', but I ruther hed de writin'.""You're perfectly right," Croyden answered."Here, boy!--do you know
Mr.Well, go down and tell him that Mr.Croyden is at Clarendon,
and ask him to come out at once.Or, stay, I'll give you a note to
him."He took a card from his pocketbook, wrote a few lines on it, and gave
it to the <DW64>.said the porter, and, dropping the grip where
he stood, he vanished.Old Mose dusted the stool with his sleeve, and proffered it."I'll lie here," he answered, stretching himself out on the grass."You
were Colonel Duval's body-servant, you say."from de time I wuz so 'igh.I don''member when I warn' he
body-survent.I follows 'im all th'oo de war, seh, an' I wus wid 'im
when he died."Tears were in the <DW54>'s eyes."Hit's purty nigh time
ole Mose gwine too.""And when he died, you stayed and looked after the old place.That was
the right thing to do," said Croyden."Didn't Colonel Duval have any
children?"De Cun'l nuvver married, cuz Miss Penelope----"

He caught himself."I toles yo 'bout hit some time, seh, mebbe!"he
ended cautiously--talking about family matters with strangers was not
to be considered."I should like to hear some time," said Croyden, not seeming to notice
the <DW54>'s reticence."Eight years ago cum corn plantin' time, seh.He jes' wen' right off
quick like, when de mis'ry hit 'im in de chist--numonya, de doctors
call'd it.De Cun'l guv de place to a No'thern gent'man, whar was he
'ticular frien', and I done stay on an' look arfter hit.yo's de gent'mans, mebbe.""I am his son," said Croyden, amused."An' yo owns Cla'endon, now, seh?What yo goin' to do wid it?""Goin' to live heah!--yo means it, seh?"the <DW54> asked, in great
amazement."Provided you will stay with me--and if you can find me
a cook.Didn' Jos'phine cook fur de Cun'l all he
life--Jos'phine, she my wife, seh--she jest gone nex' do', 'bout
some'n."He got up--"I calls her, seh.""Never mind," he said; "she will be back, presently, and there is ample
time.De udder <DW65>s done gone 'way, sence de
Cun'l died, coz deah war nothin' fur dem to do no mo', an' no buddy to
pays dem.--Dyar is Jos'phine, now, sir, she be hear torectly.An' heah
comes Marster Dick, hisself."Croyden arose and went toward the front of the house to meet him.The agent was an elderly man; he wore a black broadcloth suit, shiny at
the elbows and shoulder blades, a stiff white shirt, a wide roomy
collar, bound around by a black string tie, and a broad-brimmed
drab-felt hat.His greeting was as to one he had known all his life."I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance, sir."He drew out a key and opened the front door."Welcome to Clarendon, sir, welcome!Let us hope you will like it
enough to spend a little time here, occasionally.""I'm sure I too hope so," returned Croyden; "for I am thinking of
making it my home.""It's
convenient to Baltimore; and Philadelphia, and New York, and Washington
aren't very far away.Exactly what the city people who can afford it,
are doing now,--making their homes in the country.Hampton's a town,
but it's country to you, sir, when compared to Northumberland--open the
shutters, Mose, so we can see.... This is the library, with the
dining-room behind it, sir--and on the other side of the hall is the
drawing-room.Open it, Mose, we will be over there presently.You see,
sir, it is just as Colonel Duval left it.Your father gave instructions
that nothing should be changed.He was a great friend of the Colonel,
was he not, sir?""I believe he was," said Croyden."They met at the White Sulphur, where
both spent their summers--many years before the Colonel died.""There, hangs the Colonel's sword--he carried it through the war,
sir--and his pistols--and his silk-sash, and here, in the corner, is
one of his regimental guidons--and here his portrait in
uniform--handsome man, wasn't he?And as gallant and good as he was
handsome.Maryland lost a brave son, when he died, sir.""He looks the soldier," Croyden remarked."And he was one, sir--none better rode behind Jeb Stuart--and never far
behind, sir, never far behind!"Seventh Maryland Cavalry--he commanded it during the last
two years of the war--went in a lieutenant and came out its colonel.A
fine record, sir, a fine record!Pity it is, he had none to leave it
to!--he was the last of his line, you know, the last of the line--not
even a distant cousin to inherit."Croyden looked up at the tall, slender man in Confederate gray, with
clean-cut aristocratic features, wavy hair, and long, drooping
mustache.What a figure he must have been at the head of his command,
or leading a charge across the level, while the guns of the Federals
belched smoke, and flame and leaden death."They offered him a brigade," the agent was saying, "but he declined
it, preferring to remain with his regiment.""What did he do when the war was over?""Came home, sir, and resumed his law practice.Like his great leader,
he accepted the decision as final.He didn't spend the balance of his
life living in the past."Surely, such a man" (with a wave of his
hand toward the portrait) "could have picked almost where he chose!""No one ever just knew, sir--it had to do with Miss Borden,--the sister
of Major Borden, sir, who lives on the next place.They were
sweethearts once, but something or somebody came between them--and
thereafter, the Colonel never seemed to think of love.Perhaps, old
Mose knows it, and if he comes to like you, sir, he may tell you the
story.You understand, sir, that Colonel Duval is Mose's old master,
and that every one stands or falls, in his opinion, according as they
measure up to him.I hope you intend to keep him, sir--he has been a
faithful caretaker, and there is still good service in him--and his
wife was the Colonel's cook, so she must have been competent.She would
never cook for anyone, after he died.She thought she belonged to
Clarendon, sort of went with the place, you understand.Just stayed and
helped Mose take care of it.She doubtless will resume charge of the
kitchen again, without a word.It's the way of the old <DW64>s, sir.The young ones are pretty worthless--they've got impudent, and
independent and won't work, except when they're out of money.Excuse
me, I ramble on----"

"I'm much interested," said Croyden; "as I expect to live here, I must
learn the ways of the people.""Well, let Mose boss the <DW65>s for you, at first; he understands
them, he'll make them stand around.Come over to the drawing-room, sir,
I want you to see the furniture, and the family portraits.... There,
sir, is a set of twelve genuine Hepplewhite chairs--no doubt about it,
for the invoice is among the Colonel's papers.I don't know much about
such things, but a man was through here, about a year ago, and, would
you believe it, when he saw the original invoice and looked at the
chairs, he offered me two thousand dollars for them.Of course, as I
had been directed by your father to keep everything as the Colonel had
it, I just laughed at him.You see, sir, they have the three feathers,
and are beautifully carved, otherwise.And, here, is a lowboy, with the
shell and the fluted columns, and the cabriole legs, carved on the
knees, and the claw and ball feet.And this sofa, with the lion's claw and the eagle's wing, he wanted
to buy it, too.In fact, sir, he wanted to buy about everything in the
house--including the portraits.There are two by Peale and one by
Stuart--here are the Peales, sir--the lady in white, and the young
officer in Continental uniform; and this is the Stuart--the gentleman
in knee breeches and velvet coat.I think he is the same as the one in
uniform, only later in life.They are the Colonel's grandparents, sir:
Major Daniel Duval, of the Tenth Maryland Line, and his wife; she was a
Miss Paca--you know the family, of course, sir.The Major's commission,
sir, hangs in the hall, between the Colonel's own and his father's--he
was an officer in the Mexican war, sir.It was a fighting family, sir,
a fighting family--and a gentle one as well.'The bravest are the
tenderest, the loving are the daring.'"There was enough of the South Carolinian of the Lowlands in Croyden,
to appreciate the Past and to honor it.He might not know much
concerning Hepplewhite nor the beauty of his lines and carving, and he
might be wofully ignorant of his own ancestors, having been bred in a
State far removed from their nativity, for he had never given a thought
to the old things, whether of furniture or of forebears--they were of
the inanimate; his world had to do only with the living and what was
incidental to it.The Eternal Now was the Fetich and the God of
Northumberland, all it knew and all it lived for--and he, with every
one else, had worshipped at its shrine.and the spirit of his long dead
mother, with her heritage of aristocratic lineage, called to him,
stirring him strangely, and his appreciation, that was sleeping and not
dead, came slowly back to life.The men in buff-and-blue, in
small-clothes, in gray, the old commissions, the savour of the past
that clung around them, were working their due.For no man of culture
and refinement--nay, indeed, if he have but their veneer--can stand in
the presence of an honorable past, of ancestors distinguished and
respected, whether they be his or another's, and be unmoved."And you say there are none to inherit all these things?""Didn't the original Duval leave children?""There was but one son to each generation,
sir--and with the Colonel there was none.""Then, having succeeded to them by right of purchase, and with no
better right outstanding, it falls to me to see that they are not
shamed by the new owner.Their portraits shall remain undisturbed
either by collectors or by myself.Moreover, I'll look up my own
ancestors.I've got some, down in South Carolina and up in
Massachusetts, and if their portraits be in existence, I'll add
reproductions to keep the Duvals company.Ancestors by inheritance and
ancestors by purchase.The two of them ought to keep me straight, don't
you think?"IV

PARMENTER'S BEQUEST


Croyden, with Dick as guide and old Mose as forerunner and
shutter-opener, went through the house, even unto the garret.As in the downstairs, he found it immaculate.Josephine had kept
everything as though the Colonel himself were in presence.The bed
linen, the coverlids, the quilts, the blankets were packed in trunks,
the table-linen and china in drawers and closets.None of them was
new--practically the entire furnishing antedated 1830, and much of them
1800--except that, here and there, a few old rugs of oriental weaves,
relieved the bareness of the hardwood floors.The one concession to modernism was a bath-room, but its tin tub and
painted iron wash-stand, with the plumbing concealed by wainscoting,
proclaimed it, alas, of relatively ancient date.And, for a moment,
Croyden contrasted it with the shower, the porcelain, and the tile, of
his Northumberland quarters, and shivered, ever so slightly.It would
be the hardest to get used to, he thought.As yet, he did not know the
isolation of the long, interminably long, winter evenings, with
absolutely nothing to do and no place to go--and no one who could
understand.At length, when they were ready to retrace their steps to the lower
floor, old Mose had disappeared."Gone to tell his wife that the new master has come," said Dick."Let
us go out to the kitchen."And there they found her--bustling around, making the fire, her head
tied up in a bandana, her sleeves rolled to the shoulders.She turned,
as they entered, and dropped them an old-fashioned curtsy.Can you
cook for him, as well as you did for Colonel Duval?""Survent, marster," she said to Croyden, with another curtsy--then, to
the agent, "Kin I cooks, Marster Dick!Sut'n'y, I kin.Don' yo t'inks dis <DW65>'s forgot--jest yo waits, Marster Croyden, I
shows yo, seh, sho' nuf--jest gives me a little time to get my han' in,
seh.""You won't need much time," Dick commented."The Colonel considered her
very satisfactory, sir, very satisfactory, indeed.And he was a
competent judge, sir, a very competent judge.""Oh, we'll get along," said Croyden, with a smile at Josephine."If you
could please Colonel Duval, you will more than please me.""Have you had any experience with <DW64> servants?"Dick asked, as they
returned to the library."No," Croyden responded: "I have always lived at a Club.""Well, Mose and his wife are of the old times--you can trust them,
thoroughly, but there is one thing you'll have to remember, sir: they
are nothing but overgrown children, and you'll have to discipline them
accordingly.They don't know what it is to be impertinent, sir; they
have their faults, but they are always respectful.""Can I rely on them to do the buying?""I think so, sir, the Colonel did, I know.If you wish, I'll send you a
list of the various stores, and all you need do is to pay the bills.Is
there anything else I can do now, sir?""And thank you very much for all you have
done.""How about your baggage--can I send it out?No trouble, sir, I assure
you, no trouble.I'll just give your checks to the drayman, as I pass.By the way, sir, you'll want the telephone in, of course.And you needn't fear to speak to your neighbors;
they will take it as it's meant, sir.The next on the left is Major
Borden's, and this, on the right, is Captain Tilghman's, and across the
way is Captain Lashiel's, and Captain Carrington's, and the house
yonder, with the huge oaks in front, is Major Markoe's.""Sort of a military settlement," smiled Croyden."Yes, sir--some of them earned their title in the war, and some of
them in the militia and some just inherited it from their pas.Sort of
handed down in the family, sir.The men will call on you, promptly,
too.I shouldn't wonder some of them will be over this evening."Croyden thought instantly of the girl he had seen coming out of the
Borden place, and who had directed him to Clarendon."Would it be safe to speak to the good-looking girls, too--those who
are my neighbors?""Certainly, sir; if you tell them your name--and don't try to flirt
with them," Dick added, with a laugh."Yonder is one, now--Miss
Carrington," nodding toward the far side of the street.the girl of the blue-black hair and
slender silken ankles."She's Captain Carrington's granddaughter," Dick went on with the
Southerner's love for the definite in genealogy."Her father and mother
both died when she was a little tot, sir, and they--that is, the
grandparents, sir--raised her.That's the Carrington place she's
turning in at.Ah----"

The girl glanced across and, recognizing Dick (and, it must be
admitted, her Clarendon inquirer as well), nodded.But Croyden noticed that the older man
could teach him much in the way it should be done.He did it shortly,
sharply, in the city way; Dick, slowly, deferentially, as though it
were an especial privilege to uncover to her."Are there more like her, in Hampton?""I'm too old, sir, to be a competent judge," returned Dick, "but I
should say we have several who trot in the same class.I mean,
sir----"

"I understand!""It's no disrespect in a Marylander, I
take it, when he compares the ladies with his race-horses."At least, that's the way we of the older generation
feel; our ladies and our horses run pretty close together.But that spirit
is fast disappearing, sir!The younger ones are becoming--commercialized,
if you please.It's dollars first, and _then_ the ladies, with them--and
the horses nowhere.Though I don't say it's not wise.Horses and the
war have almost broken us, sir.We lost the dollars, or forgot about
them and they lost themselves, whichever way it was, sir.It's right that
our sons should start on a new track and run the course in their own
way--Yes, sir," suddenly recollecting himself, "Miss Carrington's a
pretty girl, and so's Miss Tayloe and Miss Lashiel and a heap more.Indeed, sir, Hampton is famed on the Eastern Sho' for her women.I'll
attend to your baggage, and the telephone, sir, and if there is
anything else I can do, pray command me.Drop in and see me when you
get up town.And removing his hat with a bow
just a little less deferential than the one he had given to Miss
Carrington, he proceeded up the street, leisurely and deliberately, as
though the world were waiting for him."The man who,
according to our way of thinking, is the acme of hustle and bustle and
business, and schemes to trap the unwary.Truly, the Eastern Shore has
much to learn--or we have much to unlearn!Well, I have tried the
one--and failed.Now, I'm going to try the other.It seems to promise a
quiet life, at least."He turned, to find Moses in the doorway, waiting."Marster Croyden," he said, "shall I puts yo satchel an' things in de
Cun'l's room, seh?"He did not know which was the Colonel's room, but it
was likely to be the best in the house, and, moreover, it was well to
follow him wherever he could."And see that my luggage is taken there, when the man brings it," he
directed--"and tell Josephine to have luncheon at one and dinner at
seven.""De Cun'l hed dinner in de middle o' de day, seh," he said, as though
Croyden had inadvertently erred.And Croyden appreciating the situation, answered:

"Well, you see, Moses, I've been used to the other way and I reckon you
will have to change to suit me."Lunch is de same as supper, I
s'pose, seh?""Yes," he said, "that will answer--like a light supper.""There may be an objection, after all, to taking over Colonel Duval's
old servants," he reflected."It may be difficult to persuade them that
he is no longer the master.I run the chance of being ruled by a dead
man."Presently his luggage arrived, and he went upstairs to unpack.Moses
looked, in wonder, at the wardrobe trunk, with every suit on a separate
hanger, the drawers for shirts and linen, the apartments for hats, and
collars, and neckties, and the shoes standing neatly in a row below."Whar's de use atak'in de things out t'al, Marster Croyden!"I mo'nt a kno'd hit.Hit's mons'us strange, seh, whar yo mon't
a' kno'd ef yo'd only stop to t'ink.F' instance, I mon't a kno'd yo'd
cum back to Clarendon, seh, some day, cuz yo spends yo money on hit."Dyar's dinner--I means lunch, seh," said Moses."And I'm ready for it," said Croyden, as he went to the iron
wash-stand, and then slowly down stairs to the dining-room.From some place, Moses had resurrected a white coat, yellow with its
ten years' rest, and was waiting to receive him.He drew out Croyden's
chair, as only a family servant of the olden times can do it, and bowed
him into his place.The table was set exactly as in Colonel Duval's day, and very prettily
set, Croyden thought, with napery spotless, and china that was thin and
fine.The latter, if he had but known it, was Lowestoft and had served
the Duvals, on that very table, for much more than a hundred years.There was cold ham, and cold chicken, lettuce with mayonnaise, deviled
eggs, preserves, with hot corn bread and tea.When Croyden had about
finished a leisurely meal, it suddenly occurred to him that however
completely stocked Clarendon was with things of the Past, they did not
apply to the larder, and _these_ victuals were undoubtedly fresh and
particularly good.Moses," he said, "I'm glad you were thoughtful enough to
send out and purchase these things," with an indicating motion to the
table."Dese things not pu'chased.Dey's borro'd, seh, from Majah Bo'den's, yass, seh!""You don't mean you borrowed my
luncheon!"Jose jes' went ovah an' sez to Cassie--she's
de cook, at de Majah's, seh--sez she, Marster Croyden don' cum and
warns some'n to eat.An' she got hit, yass, seh!""Is it the usual thing, here, to borrow an entire meal from the
neighbor's?""Sut'n'y, seh!We borrows anything we needs from the neighbors, an'
they does de same wid us.""Well, I don't want any borrowing by _us_, Moses, please remember,"
said Croyden, emphatically."The neighbors can borrow anything we have,
and welcome, but we won't claim the favor from them, you understand?"said the old <DW54>, wonderingly.Such a situation as one kitchen not borrowing from another was
incomprehensible.It had been done by the servants from time
immemorial--and, though Croyden might forbid, yet Josephine would
continue to do it, just the same--only, less openly."And see that everything is returned not later than to-morrow," Croyden
continued.I tote's dem back dis minut, seh!----"

"What?""Dese things, heah, whar yo didn' eat, seh----"

"Do you mean--Oh, Lord!""Sut'n'y, seh," returned the <DW54>."Dat's what I wuz gwine do in de
fust place."The ways they had,
were the ways that would hold them.He might protest, and order
otherwise, until doomsday, but it would not avail.For them, it was
sufficient if Colonel Duval permitted it, or if it were the custom."I think I shall let the servants manage me," he thought."They know
the ways, down here, and, besides, it's the line of least resistance."He went into the library, and, settling himself in a comfortable chair,
lit a cigarette.... It was the world turned upside down.Less than
twenty-four hours ago it was money and madness, bankruptcy and divorce
courts, the automobile pace--the devil's own.Now, it was quiet and
gentility, easy-living and refinement.Had he been in Hampton a little
longer, he would have added: gossip and tittle-tattle, small-mindedness
and silly vanity.He wondered what
Elaine Cavendish had done last evening--if she had dined at the
Club-house, and what gown she had worn, if she had played golf in the
afternoon, or tennis, and with whom; he wondered what she would do this
evening--wondered if she thought of him more than casually.Then he wondered again: who had his old quarters at
the Heights?He knew a number who would be jumping for them--who had
his old table for breakfast?it, too, would be eagerly sought--who
would take his place on the tennis and the golf teams?--what Macloud
was doing?the only man in Northumberland he
would trust, the only man in Northumberland, likely, who would care a
rap whether he came back or whether he didn't, or who would ever give
him a second thought.He wondered if Gaspard, his particular waiter,
missed him?yes, he would miss the tips, at least; yes, and the boy who
brushed his clothes and drew his bath would miss him, and his caddie,
as well.Every one whom he _paid_, would miss him....

He threw away his cigarette and sat up sharply.An old mahogany slant-top escritoire, in the corner by the window,
caught his eye.It had a shell, inlaid in maple, in the front, and the
parquetry, also, ran around the edges of the drawers and up the sides.There was one like it in the Cavendish library, he remembered.He went
over to it, and, the key being in the lock, drew out pulls and turned
back the top.Inside, there was the usual lot of pigeon holes and small
drawers, with compartments for deeds and larger papers.Either Colonel Duval, in anticipation of death, had cleaned it out, or
Moses and Josephine, for their better preservation, had packed the
contents away.He was glad of it; he could use it, at least, without
ejecting the Colonel.He closed the lid and had turned away, when the secret drawer, which,
sometimes, was in these old desks, occurred to him.He went back and
began to search for it.... And, presently, he found it.Under the
middle drawer was a sliding panel that rolled back, when he pressed on
a carved lion's head ornamentation, and which concealed a hidden
recess.It was yellow with age, and, when Croyden took it in his fingers, he
caught the faint odor of sandal wood.It was brittle in the creases,
and threatened to fall apart.So, opening it gently, he spread it on
the desk before him.Here is what he read:

                                     "Annapolis, 10 May, 1738."Honoured Sir:

  "I fear that I am about to Clear for my Last Voyage--the old
  wounds trouble me, more and more, especially those in my head and
  chest.I am confined to my bed, and though Doctor Waldron does
  not say it, I know he thinks I am bound for Davy Jones' locker.So be it--I've lived to a reasonable Age, and had a fair Time in
  the living.I've done that which isn't according to Laws, either
  of Man or God--but for the Former, I was not Caught, and for the
  Latter, I'm willing to chance him in death.When you were last
  in Annapolis, I intended to mention a Matter to you, but
  something prevented, I know not what, and you got Away ere I was
  aware of it.Now, fearing lest I Die before you come again, I
  will Write it, though it is against the Doctor's orders--which,
  however, I obey only when it pleases me."You are familiar with certain Episodes in my Early Life, spent
  under the Jolly Roger on the Spanish Main, and you have
  maintained Silence--for which I shall always be your debtor.You
  have, moreover, always been my Friend, and for that, I am more
  than your debtor.It is, therefore, but Mete that you should be
  my Heir--and I have this day Executed my last Will and Testament,
  bequeathing to you all my Property and effects.Dulany, the Attorney, who wrote it, to be probated in due
  Season."But there still remains a goodly portion which, for obvious
  reasons, may not be so disposed of.I
  buried it in September, 1720, shortly after I came to Annapolis,
  trusting not to keep so great an Amount in my House.It amounts
  to about half my Fortune, and Approximates near to Fifty Thousand
  Pounds, though that may be but a crude Estimate at best, for I am
  not skilled in the judging of Precious Stones.Where I obtained
  this wealth, I need not mention, though you can likely guess.And
  as there is nothing by which it can be identified, you can use it
  without Hesitation.Subject, however, to one Restriction: As it
  was not honestly come by (according to the World's estimate,
  because, forsooth, I only risked my Life in the gathering,
  instead of pilfering it from my Fellow man in Business, which is
  the accepted fashion) I ask you not to use it except in an
  Extremity of Need.If that need does not arise in your Life, you,
  in turn, may pass this letter on to your heir, and he, in turn,
  to his heir, and so on, until such Time as the Need may come, and
  the Restriction be lifted.And now to find the Treasure:--

  "Seven hundred and fifty feet--and at right angles to the water
  line--from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, below Annapolis,
  where the Severn runs into the Chesapeake, are four large Beech
  trees, standing as of the corners of a Square, though not
  equidistant.Bisect this Square, by two lines drawn from the
  Corners.At a Point three hundred and thirty feet,
  North-by-North-East, from where these two lines intersect and at
  a depth of Six feet, you will come upon an Iron Box.And I wish you (or whoever recovers it) Joy of
  it!--as much joy with it as I had in the Gathering."Lest I die before you come again to Annapolis, I shall leave
  this letter with Mr.Dulany, to be delivered to you on the First
  Occasion.I judge him as one who will respect a Dead man's seal.If I see you not again, Farewell.I am, sir, with great
  respect,

                          "Y'r humb'l & obed't Serv'nt

                                            "Robert Parmenter."To Marmaduke Duval, Esq'r."Below was written, by another hand:

  "The Extremity of Need has not arisen, I pass it on to my son.And below that, by still another hand:

  "Neither has the Need come to me.And below that, by still another hand:

  "Nor to me.And below that:

  "The Extremity of Need brushed by me so close I heard the
  rustling of its gown, but I did not dig.I have sufficient for
  me, and I am the last of my line.I pass it, therefore, to my
  good friend Hugh Croyden (and, in the event that he predecease
  me, to his son Geoffrey Croyden), to whom Clarendon will go upon
  my demise.Croyden read the last endorsement again; then he smiled, and the smile
broadened into an audible laugh.Well, at least, it promised something to engage
him, if time hung heavily on his hands.The Duvals seem to have taken
the bequest seriously--so, why not he?And, though the extremity of
need seems never to have reached them, it was peculiar that none of the
family had inspected the locality and satisfied himself of the accuracy
of the description.The extreme tip of Greenberry Point had shifted, a
dozen times, likely, in a hundred and ninety years, and the four beech
trees had long since disappeared, but there was no note of these facts
to aid the search.He must start just where Robert Parmenter had left
off: with the letter.He found an old history of Maryland in the book-case.Annapolis was somewhere on the Western Shore, he knew.He ran his
eyes down the Chesapeake.Yes, here it was--with Greenberry Point just
across the Severn.So much of the letter was accurate, at least.Some time soon he would go across, and
take a look over the ground.Greenberry Point, for all he knew, might
be built up with houses, or blown half a mile inland, or turned into a
fort, or anything.It was not likely to have remained the same, as in
Parmenter's day; and, yet, if it had changed, why should not the Duvals
have remarked it, in making their endorsements.He put the letter back in the secret compartment, where it had rested
for so many years.Evidently, Colonel Duval had forgotten it, in his
last brief illness.Would it
help him to the treasure as well?For with him, the restriction was
lifted--the extremity of need was come.Moreover, it was time that the
letter should be put to the test.V

MISS CARRINGTON


Croyden was sitting before the house, later in the afternoon, when an
elderly gentleman, returning leisurely from town, turned in at the
Clarendon gates."My first caller," thought Croyden, and immediately he arose and went
forward to meet him."Permit me to present myself, sir," said the newcomer."I am very glad to meet you, Captain Carrington," said Croyden, taking
the proffered hand."This is your first visit to Hampton, I believe, sir," the Captain
remarked, when they were seated under the trees."It is not
Northumberland, sir; we haven't the push, and the bustle, and the
smoke, but we have a pleasant little town, sir, and we're glad to
welcome you here.It's a long time since
Clarendon had a tenant, sir.Colonel Duval's been dead nearly ten years
now.Your father and he were particular friends, I believe."Croyden assured him that such was the case."Yes, sir, the Colonel often spoke of him to me with great affection.I
can't say I was surprised to know that he had made him his heir.He was
the last of the Duvals--not even a collateral in the family--there was
only one child to a generation, sir."Manifestly, it was not known in Hampton how Hugh Croyden came to be the
Colonel's heir, and, indeed, friendship had prompted the money-loan,
without security other than the promise of the ultimate transfer of
Clarendon and its contents.And Croyden, respecting the Colonel's wish,
evident now, though unexpressed either to his father or himself,
resolved to treat the place as a gift, and to suppress the fact that
there had been an ample and adequate consideration.After a short visit, Captain Carrington arose to go."Come over and take supper with us, this evening, sir," said he."I'll come with pleasure," Croyden answered, thinking of the girl with
the blue-black hair and slender ankles."It's the house yonder, with the white pillars--at half-after-six,
then, sir."*       *       *       *       *

As Croyden approached the Carrington house, he encountered Miss
Carrington on the walk."We have met before," she said, as he bowed over her hand."I was your
original guide to Clarendon."But you wanted to hear me say it?""I wanted to know if you could say it," she answered, gayly."Shall I put your name on the list--at the foot?""The last comer--you have to work your way up by merit, you know.""_That_ you will have to discover.""No, it should not be so difficult--for you," she answered, with a
flash of her violet eyes.as they reached the piazza--"let me
present Mr.Carrington arose to greet him--a tall, slender woman, whose age
was sixty, at least, but who appeared not a day over forty-five,
despite the dark gown and little lace cap she was wearing.She seemed
what the girl had called her--the mother, rather than the grandmother."You play Bridge, of course, Mr.Croyden," said Miss Carrington, when
the dessert was being served."I like it very much," he answered."I was sure you did--so sure, indeed, I asked a few friends in
later--for a rubber or two--and to meet you.""So it's well for me I play," he smiled.Carrington--"that is, if you care aught
for Davila's good opinion.If one can't play Bridge one would better
not be born.""When you know Mother a little better, Mr.Croyden, you will recognize
that she is inclined to exaggerate at times," said Miss Carrington."I
admit that I am fond of the game, that I like to play with people who
know how, and who, at the critical moment, are not always throwing the
wrong card--you understand?""In other words, you haven't any patience with stupidity," said
Croyden."Nor have I--but we sometimes forget that a card player is
born, not made.All the drilling and teaching one can do won't give
card sense to one who hasn't any."Miss Carrington exclaimed, "and life is too short to
bother with such people.They may be very charming otherwise, but not
across the Bridge table.""Yet ought you not to forgive them their misplays, just because they
are charming?""If you were given your choice
between a poor player who is charming, and a good player who is
disagreeable, which would you choose, Mr.Croyden?--Come, now be
honest.""It would depend upon the size of the game," Croyden responded."If it
were half a cent a point, I should choose the charming partner, but if
it were five cents or better, I am inclined to think I should prefer
the good player.""I'll remember that," said Miss Carrington."As we don't play, here,
for money stakes, you won't care if your partner isn't very expert.""The stipulation is that she shall be
charming.I should be willing to take _you_ for a partner though you
trumped my ace and forgot my lead.""_Merci_, _Monsieur_," she answered."Though you know I should do
neither."We'll go down to the Club, some evening.We old fellows aren't
much on Bridge, but we can handle a pair or three of-a-kind, pretty
good."You must not let the Captain beguile you," interposed Mrs."The men all play poker with us,--it is a heritage of the old
days--though the youngsters are breaking away from it.""And it is just as
well--we have sense enough to stop before we're broke, but they
haven't.""To hear father talk, you would think that the present generation is no
earthly good!""Yet I suppose, when he was
young, his elders held the same opinion of him.""The old ones always think the young
ones have a lot to learn--and they have, sir, they have!But it's of
another sort than we can teach them, I reckon.""We'll smoke on the piazza, sir--the ladies don't object."As they passed out, a visitor was just ascending the steps.Miss
Carrington gave a smothered exclamation and went forward."How do you do, Miss Erskine!"returned Miss Erskine, "and Mrs.Carrington--and the dear Captain, too.--I'm charmed to find you all at
home."She spoke with an affected drawl that would have been amusing in a
handsome woman, but was absurdly ridiculous in one with her figure and
unattractive face.She turned expectantly toward Croyden, and Miss Carrington presented
him."So this is the new owner of Clarendon," she gurgled with an 'a' so
broad it impeded her speech."You have kept us waiting a long time, Mr."I'm afraid you will find me a very husky myth," Croyden answered."'Husky' is scarcely the correct word, Mr.Croyden; _animated_ would be
better, I think.We scholars, you know, do not like to hear a word used
in a perverted sense."She waddled to a chair and settled into it.Croyden shot an amused
glance toward Miss Carrington, and received one in reply."No, I suppose not," he said, amiably."But, then, you know, I am not a
scholar."Miss Erskine smiled in a superior sort of way."Very few of us are properly careful of our mode of speech," she
answered.Croyden, I hope you intend to open Clarendon,
so as to afford those of us who care for such things, the pleasure of
studying the pictures, and the china, and the furniture.I am told it
contains a Stuart and a Peale--and they should not be hidden from those
who can appreciate them.""I assume you're talking of pictures," said Croyden."I am, sir,--most assuredly!""Well, I must confess ignorance, again," he replied."I wouldn't know a
Stuart from a--chromo."Miss Erskine gave a little shriek of horror.Croyden!--you're playing on my credulity.I
shall have to give you some instructions.I will lecture on Stuart and
Peale, and the painters of their period, for your especial
delectation--and soon, very soon!""I'm afraid it would all be wasted," said Croyden."I'm not fond of
art, I confess--except on the commercial side; and if I've any
pictures, at Clarendon, worth money, I'll be for selling them."Will you listen--did you ever hear such heresy?""I can't believe it of you, Mr.Let me lend you
an article on Stuart to read.I shall bring it out to Clarendon
to-morrow morning--and you can let me look at all the dear treasures,
while you peruse it."Croyden has an appointment with me to-morrow, Amelia," said
Carrington, quickly--and Croyden gave him a look of gratitude."It will be but a pleasure deferred, then, Mr.Croyden," said Miss
Erskine, impenetrable in her self conceit."The next morning will do,
quite as well--I shall come at ten o'clock--What a lovely evening this
is, Mrs.The Captain snorted with sudden anger, and, abruptly excusing himself,
disappeared in the library.Miss Carrington stayed a moment, then, with
a word to Croyden, that she would show him the article now, before the
others came, if Miss Erskine would excuse them a moment, bore him off."Pompous and stupid--an irritating nuisance, I should call her.""She's more!--she is the most arrogant, self-opinionated,
self-complacent, vapid piece of humanity in this town or any other
town.She irritates me to the point of impoliteness.She never sees
that people don't want her."At first, yes--pretty soon you will be throwing things at her--or
wanting to."She thinks she's qualified to speak on every
subject under the sun, Literature--Bridge--Teaching--Music.She went away to some preparatory school, and
finished off with another that teaches pedagogy.Straightway she became
an adept in the art of instruction, though, when she tried it, she had
the whole academy by the ears in two weeks, and the faculty asked her
to resign.Next, she got some one to take her to Europe--spent six
weeks in looking at a lot of the famous paintings, with the aid of a
guide book and a catalogue, and came home prepared to lecture on
Art--and, what's more, she has the effrontery to do it--for the benefit
of Charity, she takes four-fifths of the proceeds, and Charity gets the
balance.She read the lives of Chopin and Wagner and some of
the other composers, went to a half dozen symphony concerts, looked up
theory, voice culture, and the like, in the encyclopaedias, and now
she's a critic!Literature she imbibed from the bottle, I suppose--it
came easy to _her_!And she passes judgment upon it with the utmost
ease and final authority.She doesn't hesitate to
arraign Elwell, and we, of the village, are the very dirt beneath her
feet.I hear she's thinking of taking up Civic Improvement.I hope it
is true--she'll likely run up against somebody who won't hesitate to
tell her what an idiot she is.""Why don't you throw her out
of society, metaphorically speaking.""We can't: she belongs--which is final with us, you know.Moreover, she
has imposed on some, with her assumption of superiority, and they
kowtow to her in a way that is positively disgusting.""Why don't you, and the rest who dislike her, snub her?"You can't snub her--she never takes a snub to herself.If
you were to hit her in the face, she would think it a mistake and meant
for some one else.""Then, why not do the next best thing--have fun with her?""We do--but even that grows monotonous, with such a mountain of
Egotism--she will stay for the Bridge this evening, see if she
doesn't--and never imagine she's not wanted."Then she laughed: "I
think if she does I'll give her to you!"If she is any more
cantankerous than some of the women at the Heights, she'll be an
interesting study.Yes, I'll be glad to play a rubber with her.""If you start, you'll play the entire evening with her--we don't change
partners, here.""Look on--at the _other_ table."Then the greater the sacrifice I'm making, the greater the credit I
should receive.""It depends--on how you acquit yourself," she said gayly."There are
the others, now--come along."Miss Tilghman, Miss Lashiel and Miss Tayloe,
Mr.They all had heard of
Croyden's arrival, in Hampton, and greeted him as they would one of
themselves.And it impressed him, as possibly nothing else could have
done--for it was distinctly new to him, after the manners of chilliness
and aloofness which were the ways of Northumberland."We are going to play Bridge, Miss Erskine, will you stay and join us?""This is an ideal
evening for Bridge, don't you think so, Mr."Yes, that's what we _thought_!""And who is to play with me, dear Davila?"Croyden, I am a very exacting
partner.I may find fault with you, if you violate rules--just draw
your attention to it, you know, so you will not let it occur again.I
cannot abide blunders, Mr.Croyden--there is no excuse for them, except
stupidity, and stupidity should put one out of the game.""I'll try to do my very best," said Croyden humbly."I do not doubt that you will," she replied easily, her manner plainly
implying further that she would soon see how much that "best" was.As they went in to the drawing-room, where the tables were arranged,
Miss Erskine leading, with a feeling of divine right and an appearance
of a Teddy bear, Byrd leaned over to Croyden and said:

"She's the limit!"said Leigh, "she's past the limit; she's the sublimated It!""Which is another way of saying, she's a superlative d---- fool!""Before you came, she tackled
me on Art, and, when I confessed to only the commercial side, and an
intention to sell the Stuart and Peale, which, it seems, are at
Clarendon, the pitying contempt was almost too much for me.""She's coming out to inspect my 'treasures,' on Thursday morning.""I shall turn her over to Moses, and decamp before she gets there."came Miss Erskine's voice."I trust I'm not at her
table."And he was not--Miss Tilghman and Dangerfield were designated."Come over and help to keep me straight," Croyden whispered to Miss
Carrington.She shook her head at him with a roguish smile."You'll find your partner amply able to keep you straight," she
answered.Miss Tilghman won the cut and made it a Royal Spade."They no longer play Royal Spades in New York," said Miss Erskine."Don't know about New York," returned Miss Tilghman, placidly, "but
_we're_ playing them here, this evening.The latter shut her thick lips tightly, an instant."Oh, well, I suppose we must be provincial a little longer," she said,
sarcastically."Of course, you do not still play Royal Spades in
Northumberland, Mr.Play anything to keep the game moving," Croyden
answered.I forgot, for the instant, that Northumberland _is_ a
rapid town.--I call that card, Edith--the King of Hearts!"as Miss
Tilghman inadvertently exposed it.A moment later, Miss Tilghman, through anger, also committed a revoke,
which her play on the succeeding trick disclosed.That it was a game for pure pleasure, without stakes, made no
difference to Miss Erskine.Technically it was a revoke, and she was
within her rights when she exclaimed it.she said exultantly, "and you cannot make game this
hand.""I'm very sorry, partner," Miss Tilghman apologized."It's entirely excusable under the circumstances," said Dangerfield,
with deliberate accent.Dangerfield is," Miss Erskine smiled."To my mind,
nothing excuses a revoke except sudden blindness.""And you would claim it even then, I suppose?""I said, sudden blindness was the only excuse, Mr.Had you
observed my language more closely, you doubtless would have
understood.--It is your lead, partner."Dangerfield, with a wink at Croyden, subsided, and the hand was
finished, as was the next, when Croyden was dummy, without further
jangling.But midway in the succeeding hand, Miss Erskine began.Croyden," she said, "when you have the Ace, King, and _no
more_ in a suit, you should lead the Ace and then the King, to show
that you have no more--give the down-and-out signal.We would have made
an extra trick, if you had done so--I could have given you a diamond to
trump.As it was, you led the King and then the Ace, and I supposed, of
course, you had at least four in suit.""I'm very sorry; I'll try to remember in future," said Croyden with
affected contrition.But, at the end of the hand, he was in disgrace again."If your original lead had been from your fourth best, partner, I could
have understood you," she said."As it was, you misinformed me.Under
the rule of eleven, I had but the nine to beat, I played the ten and
Mr.Dangerfield covered with the Knave, which by the rule you should
have held.We lost another trick by it, you see."Croyden answered; "that's two tricks we've
lost by my stupid playing.I'm afraid I'm pretty ignorant, Miss
Erskine, for I don't know what is meant by the rule of eleven."Miss Erskine's manner of cutting the cards was somewhat indicative of
her contempt--lingeringly, softly, putting them down as though she
scorned to touch them except with the tips of her fingers."The rule of eleven is usually one of the first things learned by a
beginner at Bridge," she said, witheringly."I do not always agree with
Mr.Elwell, some of whose reasoning and inferences, in my opinion, are
much forced, but his definition of this rule is very fair.I give it in
his exact words, which are: 'Deduct the size of the card led from
eleven, and the difference will show how many cards, higher than the
one led, are held outside the leader's hand.'For example: if you lead
a seven then there are four higher than the seven in the other three
hands.""What a bully rule!--It's very informing,
isn't it?""Yes, it's very informing--in more ways than one," she answered.Whereat Miss Tilghman laughed outright, and Dangerfield had to retrieve
a card from the floor, to hide his merriment.asked Miss Carrington, coming over to their
table."You people seem to be enjoying the game."Which sent Miss Tilghman into a gale of laughter, in which Dangerfield
joined.Miss Erskine frowned in disapproval and astonishment."They really know better, but
this is the silly season, I suppose.They have much to learn, too--much
to learn, indeed.""I was explaining a
few things about the game to Mr.Croyden, Davila, the rule of eleven
and the Ace-King lead, and, for some reason, it seemed to move them to
jollity."exclaimed Miss Carrington, her violet eyes gleaming
with suppressed mirth.Croyden does not think we were laughing at _him_!"returned Croyden solemnly, "and, if you were, my
stupidity quite justified it, I'm sure.If Miss Erskine will only bear
with me, I'll try to learn--Bully thing, that rule of eleven!"It was now Croyden's deal and the score, games all--Miss Erskine having
made thirty-six on hers, and Dangerfield having added enough to Miss
Tilghman's twenty-eight to, also, give them game."How cleverly you deal the cards," Miss Erskine remarked."You're
particularly nimble in the fingers.""I acquired it dealing faro," Croyden returned, innocently.exclaimed Miss Carrington, choking back a laugh."A game about which you should know nothing, my dear," Miss Erskine
interposed."Faro is played only in gambling hells and mining camps.""And in some of the Clubs _in New York_," Croyden added--at which Miss
Tilghman's mirth burst out afresh."That's where I learned to copper
the ace or to play it open.--I'll make it no trumps.""Somebody will win the rubber, this hand," Miss Erskine
platitudinized,--with the way such persons have of announcing a self
evident fact--as she spread out her hand."It is fair support,
partner."Then proceeded with much apparent thought and
deliberation, to play the hand like the veriest tyro.Miss Erskine fidgeted in her seat, gave half smothered exclamations,
looked at him appealingly at every misplay.Croyden
was wrapped in the game--utterly oblivious to anything but the
cards--leading the wrong one, throwing the wrong one, matching
pasteboards, that was all.And when, at the last, holding only a
thirteener and a fork in Clubs, he led the losing card of the latter,
she could endure the agony no longer."That is five tricks you have lost, Mr.Croyden, to say nothing of the
rubber!""I must go, now--a delightful game!thank you, my
dear Davila.So much obliged to you all, don't you know.Ah, Captain
Carrington, will you see me as far as the front gate?--I won't disturb
the game."Yes, I'll take her to the gate!"muttered the Captain aside to
Croyden, who was the very picture of contrition."But if she only were
a man!"I think it was lovely--perfectly lovely!"exclaimed Miss
Tilghman.--"Oh!that last hand was too funny for words.--If only you
could have seen her face, Mr.[Illustration: LEADING THE WRONG ONE, THROWING THE WRONG ONE, MATCHING
PASTEBOARDS, THAT WAS ALL]

"I didn't dare!""One look, and I'd have given the whole
thing away.""She never suspected.--I tell you, she is as dense as asphalt," said
Miss Carrington."Come, now we'll have some Bridge.""And I'll try to observe the rule of eleven!"He lingered a moment, after the game was ended and the others had gone.When he came to say good-night, he held Miss Carrington's slender
fingers a second longer than the occasion justified."As often as you wish," she answered."You have the advantage of
proximity, at least."VI

CONFIDENCE AND SCRUPLES


The next month, to Croyden, went pleasantly enough.He was occupied
with getting the household machinery to run according to his ideas--and
still retain Moses and Josephine, who, he early discovered, were
invaluable to him; in meeting the people worth knowing in the town and
vicinity, and in being entertained, and entertaining--all very quietly
and without ostentation.He had dined, or supped, or played Bridge at all the houses, had given
a few small things himself, and ended by paying off all scores with a
garden party at Clarendon, which Mrs.Carrington had managed for him
with exquisite taste (and, to him, amazing frugality)--and, more
wonderful still, with an entire effacement of _self_.It was Croyden's
party throughout, though her hand was at the helm, her brain
directed--and Hampton never knew.And the place _had_ looked attractive; with the house set in its wide
sweep of velvety lawn amid great trees and old-fashioned flowers and
hedges.With the furniture cleaned and polished, the old china
scattered in cupboard and on table, the portraits and commissions
freshly dusted, the swords glistening as of yore.And in that month, Croyden had come to like Hampton immensely.The
absence, in its society, of all attempts at show, to make-believe, to
impress, to hoodwink, was refreshingly novel to him, who, hitherto, had
known it only as a great sham, a huge affectation, with every one
striving to outdo everyone else, and all as hollow as a rotten gourd.He had not got used, however, to the individual espionage of the
country town--the habit of watching one's every movement, and telling
it, and drawing inferences therefrom--inferences tinctured according to
the personal feelings of the inferer.He learned that, in three weeks, they had him "taken" with every
eligible girl in town, engaged to four and undecided as to two more.They busied themselves with his food,--they nosed into his drinks, his
cigars, his cigarettes, his pipes,--they bothered themselves about his
meal hours,--they even inspected his wash when it hung on the line!The rest were totally different; they let every
one alone.They did not intrude nor obtrude--they went their way, and
permitted every one to go his.So much had been the way of Northumberland, so much he had been used to
always.But--and here was the difference from Northumberland, the vital
difference, indeed--they were interested in you, if _you_ wished them
to be--and it was genuine interest, not pretense.This, and the way
they had treated him as one of them, because Colonel Duval had been
his father's friend, made Croyden feel very much at home.At intervals, he had taken old Parmenter's letter from its secret
drawer, and studied it, but he had been so much occupied with getting
acquainted, that he had done nothing else.Moreover, there was no
pressing need for haste.If the treasure had kept on Greenberry Point
for one hundred and ninety years, it would keep a few months longer.Besides, he was a bit uncertain whether or not he should confide in
someone, Captain Carrington or Major Borden.He would doubtless need
another man to help him, even if the location should be easily
determined, which, however, was most unlikely.For him, alone, to go
prying about on Greenberry Point, would surely occasion comment and
arouse suspicion--which would not be so likely if there were two of
them, and especially if one were a well-known resident of Maryland.He finally determined, however, to go across to Annapolis and look over
the ground, before he disclosed the secret to any one.When he came to look up the matter of transportation, however, he was
surprised to find that no boat ran between Annapolis and Hampton--or
any other port on the Eastern Shore.He either had to go by water to
Baltimore (which was available on only three days a week) and thence
finish his journey by rail or transfer to another boat, or else he had
to go by steam cars north to Wilmington, and then directly south again
to Annapolis.In either case, a day's journey between two towns that
were almost within seeing distance of each other, across the Bay.Of
the two, he chose to go by boat to Baltimore.Then, the afternoon of the day before it sailed, he received a
wire--delivered two hours and more after its receipt, in the leisurely
fashion of the Eastern Shore.It was from Macloud, and dated
Philadelphia.His reply brought Macloud in the morning train.Moses took his bag, and they walked out
to Clarendon."The truth is,
Colin, they're not popular down here.The old families won't have
them--they're innovations--the saddle horse and the family carriage are
still to the fore with them.Only the butcher, and the baker and the
candlestick maker have motors.There's one, now--he's the candlestick
maker, I think.It reminds me
of the one down South, where they wouldn't have electric cars.Then rather than commit the awful sin
of letting _new_ horses come into the city, they accepted the trolley.The fashion suits my pocketbook, however, so I've no kick coming.""What do you want with a car here, anyway?""It looks as
if you could walk from one end of the town to the other in fifteen
minutes.""And the baker et cetera have theirs only for show, I suppose?""Yes, that's about it--the roads, hereabout, are sandy and poor.""Then, I'm with your old families.They may be conservative, at times a
trifle too much so, but, in the main, their judgment's pretty reliable,
according to conditions.What sort of place did you find--I mean the
house?""Hum--I see--the aristocracy of birth, not dollars.""Exactly!--How do you do, Mr.Fitzhugh," as they passed a policeman in
uniform."You meet Fitzhugh every place
when he is off duty.His occupation does not figure, in
the least.""So you like it--Hampton, I mean?""I've been here a month--and that month I've enjoyed--thoroughly
enjoyed.However, I do miss the Clubs and their life.""I can understand," Macloud interjected."And the ability to get, instantly, anything you want----"

"Much of which you don't want--and wouldn't get, if you had to write
for it, or even to walk down town for it--which makes for economy,"
observed Macloud sententiously."But, more than either, I miss the personal isolation which one can
have in a big town, when he wishes it--and has always, in some
degree.""And _that_ gets on your nerves!""Well, you won't
mind it after a while, I think.You'll get used to it, and be quite
oblivious."I've been here only a short time, remember.Come back in six months,
say, and I may have kicks in plenty.""You may find it a bit dreary in winter--who the deuce is that girl
yonder, Geoffrey?"They were opposite Carrington's, and down the walk toward the gate was
coming the maid of the blue-black hair, and slender ankles.She wore a
blue linen gown, a black hat, and her face was framed by a white silk
parasol."That is Miss Carrington," said Croyden.Macloud looked at him with a grin."She has nothing to do with your liking the town, I suppose?""Well, she's not exactly a deterrent--and there are half a dozen more
of the same sort.Oh, on that score, Hampton's not half bad, my
friend!""You mean there are half a dozen of _that_ sort," with a slight jerk of
his head toward Miss Carrington, "who are unmarried?"Croyden nodded--then looked across; and both men raised their hats and
bowed."Several--but you let them _alone_--it's not fashionable here, as yet,
for a pretty married woman to have an affair.She loves her husband, or
acts it, at least.They're neither prudes nor prigs, but they are not
_that_.""But my experience has been that
the pretty married woman who won't flirt, if occasion offers where
there is no danger of being compromised, is a pretty scarce article."You're too cynical," said Croyden."We turn in here--this is
Clarendon.""I've been sympathizing with
you, because I thought you were living in a shack-of-a-place--and,
behold!""Yes, it is not bad," said Croyden."I've no ground for complaint, on
that head.I can, at least, be comfortable here.That evening, after dinner, when the two men were sitting in the
library while a short-lived thunder storm raged outside, Macloud, after
a long break in the conversation--which is the surest sign of
camaraderie among men--observed, apropos of nothing except the talk of
the morning:

"Lord!"You did, by damning it with faint praise.""Your present environment--and yet, look you!A comfortable house, fine
grounds, beautiful old furnishings, delicious victuals, and two <DW64>
servants, who are devoted to you, or the place--no matter which, for it
assures their permanence; the one a marvelous cook, the other a
competent man; and, by way of society, a lot of fine, old antebellum
families, with daughters like the Symphony in Blue, we saw this
morning."And that is not all," said Croyden, laughing and pointing to the
portraits."And you have come by them clean-handed, which is rare.--Moreover, I
fancy you are one who has them by inheritance, as well.""I'm glad to say I have--ancestors are distinctly
fashionable down here.But _that's_ not all I've got.""There is only one thing more--money," said Macloud."You haven't found
any of it down here, have you?""That is just what I don't know," Croyden replied, tossing away his
cigarette, and crossing to the desk by the window.He handed the Parmenter letter to Macloud."Read it through--the
endorsements last, in their order--and then tell me what you think of
it."..."These endorsements, I take it," said Macloud, "though without date and
signed only with initials, were made by the original addressee,
Marmaduke Duval, his son, who was presumably Daniel Duval, and Daniel
Duval's son, Marmaduke; the rest, of course, is plain.""That is correct," Croyden answered."I have made inquiries--Colonel
Duval's father was Marmaduke, whose son was Daniel, whose son was
Marmaduke, the addressee.""My dear fellow, I'm not denying it!I simply want your opinion--what
to do?""Have you shown this letter to anyone else?""Well, you're a fool to show it even to me.What assurance have you
that, when I leave here, I won't go straight to Annapolis and steal
your treasure?""No assurance, except a lamblike trust in your friendship," said
Croyden, with an amused smile."Your recent experience with Royster & Axtell and the Heights should
beget confidences of this kind?"he said sarcastically, tapping the
letter the while."You trust too much in friendship, Croyden.Tests of
half a million dollars aren't human!""I always
thought there was something God-like about me.But it was a fearful risk, man, a fearful risk!"The man to whom it was addressed
believed it--else why did he endorse it to his son?And we can assume
that Daniel Duval knew his father's writing, and accepted it.--Oh, it's
genuine enough.But to prove it, did you identify Marmaduke Duval's
writing--any papers or old letters in the house?""I don't know," returned Croyden."Better not arouse his curiosity--<DW54>s are most inquisitive, you
know--where did you find the letter?""Another proof of its genuineness," said Macloud."Have you made any
effort to identify this man Parmenter--from the records at
Annapolis.""No--I've done nothing but look at the letter--except to trace the
Duval descent," Croyden replied."He speaks, here, of his last will and testament being left with Mr.If it were probated, that will establish Parmenter, especially
if Marmaduke Duval is the legatee.I never was there--I looked it up on the map I found, here,
and Greenberry Point is as the letter says--across the Severn River
from it."Macloud laughed, in good-natured raillery."You seem to have been in a devil of a hurry!""At the same
rate of progression, you will go to Annapolis some time next spring,
and get over to Greenberry Point about autumn.""On the contrary, it's your coming that delayed me," Croyden smiled."But for your wire, I would have started this morning--now, if you will
accompany me, we'll go day-after-to-morrow.""It's a long journey around the Bay by rail--I'd rather cross to Baltimore
by boat; from there it's only an hour's ride to Annapolis by electric
cars.And there isn't any boat sailing until day-after-to-morrow.""Let me see where we are, and where
Annapolis is.... Hum!Can't we get a boat in
the morning to take us across direct--charter it, I mean?The
Chesapeake isn't wide at this point--a sailing vessel ought to make it
in a few hours."He went to the telephone and called
up Dick.he said.--"I've a friend who wants
to go across the Bay to Annapolis, in the morning.Where can I find out
if there is a sailing vessel, or a motor boat, obtainable?...Miles Casey?--on Fleet Street, near the wharf?...Thank you!--He says," turning to Macloud, "Casey will likely take
us--he has a fishing schooner and it is in port.He lives on Fleet
Street--we will walk down, presently, and see him."Macloud nodded assent, and fell to studying the directions again.Croyden returned to his chair and smoked in silence, waiting for his
friend to conclude.At length, the latter folded the letter and looked
up."It oughtn't to be hard to find," he observed."Not if the trees are still standing, and the Point is in the same
place," said Croyden."But we're going to find the Point shifted about
ninety degrees, and God knows how many feet, while the trees will have
long since disappeared.""Or the whole Point may be built over with houses!""Why not go the whole throw-down at once--make it impossible to
recover rather than only difficult to locate!"He made a gesture of
disbelief."Do you fancy that the Duvals didn't keep an eye on
Greenberry Point?--that they wouldn't have noted, in their
endorsements, any change in the ground?So it's clear, in my mind,
that, when Colonel Duval transferred this letter to you, the Parmenter
treasure could readily be located.""I'm sure I shan't object, in the least, if we walk directly to the
spot, and hit the box on the third dig of the pick!""But let us forget the old pirate, until to-morrow; tell me about
Northumberland--it seems a year since I left!When one goes away for
good and all, it's different, you know, from going away for the
summer.""And you think you have left it for good and all?"asked Macloud,
blowing a smoke-ring and watching him with contemplative eyes--"Well,
the place is the same--only more so.The Heights is more lively than when you left, teas, and dinners, and
tournaments and such like.--In town, the Northumberland's resuming its
regulars--the theatres are open, and the Club has taken the bald-headed
row on Monday nights as usual.Billy Cain has turned up engaged, also
as usual--this time, it's a Richmond girl,'regular screamer,' he says.It will last the allotted time, of course--six weeks was the limit for
the last two, you'll remember.Smythe put it all over Little in the
tennis tournament, and 'Pud' Lester won the golf championship.Terry's
horse, _Peach Blossom_, fell and broke its neck in the high jump, at
the Horse Show; Terry came out easier--he broke only his collar-bone.Mattison is the little bounder he always was--a month hasn't changed
him--except for the worse.Colloden is the
same bully fellow; he is disconsolate, now, because he is beginning to
take on flesh.""Danridge is back from the North
Cape, via Paris, with a new drink he calls _The Spasmodic_--it's made
of gin, whiskey, brandy, and absinthe, all in a pint of sarsaparilla.He says it's great--I've not sampled it, but judging from those who
have he is drawing it mild.... Betty Whitridge and Nancy Wellesly have
organized a Sinners Class, prerequisites for membership in which are
that you play Bridge on Sundays and have abstained from church for at
least six months.They filled it the first
morning, and have a waiting list of something over seventy-five....
That is about all I can think of that's new."Croyden asked--with the lingering
desire one has not to be forgot.Macloud shot a questioning glance at him."Beyond the fact that the bankruptcy schedules show you were pretty
hard hit, I've heard no one comment," he said.Elaine Cavendish is sponsor for that report--she says you told
her you were called, suddenly, abroad."Then, after a pause:

"Any one inclined to play the devoted, there?""Plenty inclined--plenty anxious," replied Macloud."I'm looking a bit
that way myself--I may get into the running, since you are out of it,"
he added.Croyden made as though to speak, then bit off the words."Yes, I'm out of it," he said shortly."But you're not out of it--if you find the pirate's treasure.""Wait until I find it--at present, I'm only an 'also ran.'""Who had the field, however, until withdrawn," said Macloud."But things have changed with me, Macloud;
I've had time for thought and meditation.I'm not sure I should go back
to Northumberland, even if the Parmenter jewels are real.Had I stayed
there I suppose I should have taken my chance with the rest, but I'm
becoming doubtful, recently, of giving such hostages to fortune.It's
all right for a woman to marry a rich man, but it is a totally
different proposition for a poor man to marry a rich woman.Even with
the Parmenter treasure, I'd be poor in comparison with Elaine Cavendish
and her millions--and I'm afraid the sweet bells would soon be jangling
out of tune.""Would you condemn the girl to spinsterhood, because there are few men
in Northumberland, or elsewhere, who can match her in wealth?"I mean, only, that the man should be able to support her
according to her condition in life.--In other words, pay all the bills,
without drawing on her fortune.""Those views will never make you the leader of a popular propaganda!"said Macloud, with an amused smile."In fact, you're alone in the
woods."But the views are not irrevocable--I may change, you know.In the meantime, let us go down to Fleet Street and interview Casey.And then, if you're good, I'll take you to call on Miss Carrington.""Come along, man, come
along!"VII

GREENBERRY POINT


There was no trouble with Casey--he had been mighty glad to take them.And, at about noon of the following day, they drew in to the ancient
capital, having made a quick and easy run from Hampton.It was clear, bright October weather, when late summer seems to linger
for very joy of staying, and all nature is in accord.The State House,
where Washington resigned his commission--with its chaste lines and
dignified white dome, when viewed from the Bay (where the monstrosity
of recent years that has been hung on behind, is not visible) stood out
clearly in the sunlight, standing high above the town, which slumbers,
in dignified ease, within its shadow.A few old mansions, up the Spa,
seen before they landed, with the promise of others concealed among the
trees, higher up, told their story of a Past departed--a finished
city."Yonder, sir, on the far side of the Severn--the strip of land which
juts out into the Bay.""First hypothesis, dead as a musket!""There isn't
a house in sight--except the light-house, and it's a bug-light.""No houses--but where are the trees?""It seems
pretty low," he said, to the skipper; "is it ever covered with water?""I think not, sir--the water's just eating it slowly away."Croyden nodded, and faced townward."What is the enormous white stone building, yonder?""The Naval Academy--that's only one of the buildings, sir, Bancroft
Hall.The whole Academy occupies a great stretch of land along the
Severn."They landed at the dock, at the foot of Market Place and inquired the
way to Carvel Hall--that being the hotel advised by Dick.They were
directed up Wayman's alley--one of the numerous three foot
thoroughfares between streets, in which the town abounds--to Prince
George Street, and turning northward on it for a block, past the once
splendid Brice house, now going slowly to decay, they arrived at the
hotel:--the central house of English brick with the wings on either
side, and a modern hotel building tacked on the rear.was Macloud's comment, as they ascended the steps
to the brick terrace and, thence, into the hotel."Isn't this an old
residence?"he inquired of the clerk, behind the desk.It's the William Paca (the Signer) mansion, but it served as
the home of Dorothy Manners in _Richard Carvel_, and hence the name,
sir: Carvel Hall.We've many fine houses here: the Chase House--he
also was a Signer; the Harwood House, said to be one of the most
perfect specimens of Colonial architecture in America; the Scott House,
on the Spa; the Brice House, next door; McDowell Hall, older than any
of them, was gutted by fire last year, but has been restored; the Ogle
mansion--he was Governor in the 1740's, I think.this was the Paris
of America before and during the Revolution.Why, sir, the tonnage of
the Port of Annapolis, in 1770, was greater than the tonnage of the
Port of Baltimore, to-day."What's
happened to it since 1770?""Nothing, sir--that's the trouble, it's progressed backward--and
Baltimore has taken its place.""It's being served now, sir--twelve-thirty to two.""Order a pair of saddle horses, and have them around at one-thirty,
please.""There is no livery connected with the hotel, sir, but I'll do what I
can.There isn't any saddlers for hire, but we will get you a pair of
'Cheney's Best,' sir--they're sometimes ridden.However, you had
better drive, if you will permit me to suggest, sir.""No!--we will try the horses," he said.It had been determined that they should ride for the reasons, as urged
by Macloud, that they could go on horseback where they could not in a
conveyance, and they would be less likely to occasion comment.The
former of which appealed to Croyden, though the latter did not.Macloud had borrowed an extra pair of riding breeches and puttees, from
his friend, and, at the time appointed, the two men passed through the
office.Two <DW64> lads were holding a pair of rawboned nags, that resembled
saddlers about as much as a cigar-store Indian does a sonata.Croyden
looked them over in undisguised disgust."If these are Cheney's Best," he commented, "what in Heaven's name are
his worst?"said Macloud, adjusting the stirrups."Get aboard and leave
the kicking to the horses, they may be better than they look."Straight up to the College green," he replied, pointing; "then one
square to the right to King George Street, and on out it, across
College Creek, to the Marine Barracks.The road forks there; you turn
to the right; and the bridge is at the foot of the hill.""He ought to write a guide book," said Croyden."Well paved
streets,--but a trifle hard for riding.""And more than a trifle dirty," Croyden added."My horse isn't so
bad--how's yours?""He'll do!--This must be the Naval Academy," as they passed along a
high brick wall--"Yonder, are the Barracks--the Marines are drilling in
front."They clattered over the creek, rounded the quarters of the
"Hermaphrodites," and saw below them the wide bridge, almost a half a
mile long, which spans the Severn.The draw was open, to let a motor
boat pass through, but it closed before they reached it.Macloud exclaimed, drawing rein,
midway."Look at the high bluff, on the farther shore, with the view up
the river, on one side, and down the Bay, and clear across on the
other.... Now," as they wound up on the hill, "for the first road to
the right."laughed Croyden, as the road swung
abruptly westward and directly away from Greenberry Point."Let us go a little farther," said Macloud."There must be a way--a
bridle path, if nothing better--and, if we must, we can push straight
through the timber; there doesn't seem to be any fences.You see, it
was rational to ride."as one unexpectedly took off to the right,
among the trees, and bore almost immediately eastward.Presently they were startled by a series of explosions, a short
distance ahead.said Croyden, with mock
seriousness.We must be a mile and more from the Point.It's
some one blasting, I think.""It wasn't sufficiently muffled," Croyden answered.They waited a few moments: hearing no further noises, they proceeded--a
trifle cautiously, however.A little further on, they came upon a wood
cutter."He doesn't appear at all alarmed," Croyden observed."What were the
explosions, a minute ago?""They weren't nothing," said the man, leaning on his axe."The Navy's
got a'speriment house over here.Yer don't
need be skeered.If yer goin' to the station, it's just a little ways,
now," he added, with the country-man's curiosity--which they did not
satisfy.They passed the buildings of the Experiment Station and continued on,
amid pine and dogwood, elms and beeches.They were travelling parallel
with the Severn, and not very distant, as occasional glimpses of blue
water, through the trees, revealed.The
river became plainly visible with the Bay itself shimmering to the
fore.Then the trees ended abruptly, and they came out on Greenberry
Point: a long, flat, triangular-shaped piece of ground, possibly two
hundred yards across the base, and three hundred from base to point."Somewhere near here, possibly just where your horse is standing, is
the treasure," said Macloud.laughed Croyden, "and that appears to be my only chance,
for I can't see a trace of the trees which formed the square.""Remember, you didn't expect to
find things marked off for you."It's amazingly easier than I dared to hope."we can't dig six feet deep over all of forty acres.We
shall have the whole of Annapolis over to help us before we've done a
square of forty feet.""The instructions say: seven hundred and fifty feet
back, from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, is the quadrangle of
trees.That was in 1720, one hundred and ninety years ago.They must
have been of good size then--hence, they would be of the greater size,
now, or else have disappeared entirely.There isn't a single tree which
could correspond with Parmenter's, closer than four hundred yards, and,
as the point would have been receding rather than gaining, we can
assume, with tolerable certainty, that the beeches have
vanished--either from decay or from wind storms, which must be very
severe over in this exposed land.Hence, must not our first quest be
for some trace of the trees?""That sounds reasonable," said Croyden, "and, if the Point has receded,
which is altogether likely, then we are pretty near the place.""Yes!--if the Point has simply receded, but if it has shifted
laterally, as well, the problem is not so simple.""Let us go out to the Point, and look at the ruins of the light-house.If we can get near enough to ascertain when it was built, it may help
us.Evidently there was none erected here, in Parmenter's time, else
he would not have chosen this place to hide his treasure."But the light-house was a barren yield.It was a crumbling mass of
ruins, lying out in water, possibly fifty feet--the real house was a
bug-light farther out in the Bay."Well, there's no one to see us, so why shouldn't we make a search for
the trees?"He went out on the extreme edge, faced about, and taking a line at
right angles to it, stepped two hundred and fifty paces.He ended in
sand--and, for another fifty paces, sand--sand unrelieved by aught save
some low bushes sparsely scattered here and there."Somewhere hereabout, according to present conditions, the trees should
be," he said."Not very promising," was Croyden's comment."Let us assume that the diagonal lines drawn between the trees
intersect at this point," Macloud continued, producing a compass."Then, one hundred and ten paces North-by-North-East is the place we
seek."He stepped the distance carefully--Croyden following with the
horses--and sunk his heel into the sand beside a clump of wire grass."Here is the old buccaneer's hoard!"[Illustration: HE WENT OUT ON THE EXTREME EDGE, FACED ABOUT, AND STEPPED
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES]

"You dig--I'll hold the horses; your hands are tougher than mine."You mean, you would try to purchase
it?""Yes, as a site for a house, ostensibly.I might buy a lot beginning,
say one hundred and fifty yards back from the Point, and running, at an
even width of two hundred yards, from the Severn to the Bay."If the present owner will sell," appended Croyden--"and if his price
isn't out of all reason.I can't go much expense, you know.""Never mind the expense--that can be arranged.If he will sell, the
rest is easy."And we will share equally, then," said Croyden."I've got more money than I want, let me have
some fun with the excess, Croyden.And this promises more fun than I've
had for a year--hunting a buried treasure, within sight of Maryland's
capital.Moreover, it won't likely be out of reach of your own
pocketbook, this can't be very valuable land.""Let us ride around over the intended site, and prospect--we may
discover something."But, though, they searched for an hour, they were utterly unsuccessful.The four beech trees had disappeared as completely as though they never
were."I'm perfectly confident, however," Macloud remarked as they turned
away toward town, "that somewhere, within the lines of your proposed
lot, lie the Parmenter jewels.Once you have title to
it, you may plow up the whole thing to any depth you please, and no one
may gainsay you.""I'm not so sure," replied Croyden."My knowing that the treasure was
on it when purchased, may make me liable to my grantor for an
accounting.""Yet, I have every reason to believe--the letter is most specific.""Suppose, after you've paid a big price for the land, you don't find
the treasure, could you make him take it back and refund the purchase
money?""No, most assuredly, no," smiled Croyden.You must account for what you find--if you
don't find it, you must keep the land, anyway."It's predicated on the proposition that I have knowingly deceived him
into selling something for nothing.However, I'm not at all clear about
it; and we will buy if we can--and take the chances.But we won't go to
work with a brass band, old man."At the top of the hill, beyond the Severn, there was a road which took
off to the left."This parallels the road by the Marine Barracks, suppose we turn in
here," Macloud said.A little way on, they passed what was evidently a fine hospital, with
the United States flag flying over it.Just beyond, occupying the point
of land where College Creek empties into the Severn, was the Naval
Cemetery."They have the place of interment
exceedingly handy to the hospital.he asked,
indicating a huge dome, hideously ornate with gold and white, that
projected above the trees, some distance ahead."Unless it's a custard-and-cream pudding
for the Midshipmen's supper.I
recollect now: the Government has spent millions in erecting new
Academy buildings; and someone in the Navy remarked, 'If a certain chap
_had_ to kill somebody, he couldn't see why he hadn't selected the
fellow who was responsible for them--his work at Annapolis would have
been ample justification.'Judging from the atrocity to our fore, the
officer didn't overdraw it."They took the road along the officers' quarters on Upshur Row, and came
out the upper gate into King George Street, thereby missing the Chapel
(of the custard-and-cream dome) and all the other Smith buildings."The real estate agent is more
important now."It was the quiet hour when they got back to the hotel, and the clerk
was standing in the doorway, sunning himself."It wasn't bad," returned Croyden."Can you tell me
who owns Greenberry Point?"The Government owns it--they bought it for the Rifle
Range.""Yes, sir!--from the Point clear up to the Experiment Station.""That's the end of the purchase idea!""I thought it was'most
too good to last.""It got punctured very early," Macloud agreed."And the question is, what to do, now?Titles in a small
town are known, particularly, when they're in the United States.However, it's easy to verify--we'll hunt up a real estate
office--they'll know."But when they had dressed, and sought a real estate office, the last
doubt vanished: it confirmed the clerk."If you haven't anything particularly pressing," said Macloud, "I
suggest that we remain here for a few days and consider what is best to
do.""My most pressing business is to find the treasure!"then we're on the job until it's found--if it takes a year or
longer."And when Croyden looked his surprise: "I've nothing to do, old
chap, and one doesn't have the opportunity to go treasure hunting more
than once in a lifetime.Picture our satisfaction when we hear the pick
strike the iron box, and see the lid turned back, and the jewels
coruscating before us.""But what if there isn't any coruscating--that's a good word, old
man--nor any iron box?""Don't be so pessimistic--_think_ we're going to find it, it will help
a lot.""How about if we _don't_ find it?""Then, at least, we'll have had a good time in hunting, and have done
our best to succeed.""It's a new thing to hear old cynical Macloud preaching optimism!"laughed Croyden--"our last talk, in Northumberland, wasn't particularly
in that line, you'll remember.""Our talk in Northumberland had to do with other people and
conditions.This is an adventure, and has to do solely with ourselves.Some difference, my dear Croyden, some difference!What do you say to
an early breakfast to-morrow, and then a walk over to the Point.It's
something like your Eastern Shore to get to, however,--just across the
river by water, but three miles around by the Severn bridge.We can
have the whole day for prospecting.""I'm under your orders," said Croyden."You're in charge of this
expedition."They had been passing numerous naval officers in uniform, some well
set-up, some slouchy."The uniform surely does show up the man for what he is," said Macloud."Look at these two for instance--from the stripes on the sleeves, a
Lieutenant-Commander and a Senior Lieutenant.Did you ever see a real
Bowery tough?--they are in that class, with just enough veneer to
deceive, for an instant.Observe the dignity, the snappy walk, the inherent air
of command.""Isn't it the fault of the system?""Every Congressman
holds a competitive examination in his district; and the appointment
goes to the applicant who wins--be he what he may.For that reason, I
dare say, the Brigade of Midshipmen contains muckers as well as
gentlemen--and officers are but midshipmen of a larger growth."To be a commissioned officer, in
either Army or Navy, ought to attest one's gentle birth.""It raises a presumption in their favor, at least."do you think the two who passed us could hide behind that
presumption longer than the fraction of an instant?"I was accounting for it, not defending it.It's a pity, of course, but that's one of the misfortunes of a Republic
where all men are equal.""Men aren't equal!--they're born to
different social scales, different intellectualities, different
conditions otherwise.For the purpose of suffrage they may, in the
theory of our government, be equal--but we haven't yet demonstrated it.We have included the <DW64>, only
within the living generation--and it's entirely evident, now, we made a
monstrous mistake by doing it.laughed Macloud, as they ascended the steps of the
hotel."For my part, I'm for the Moslem's Paradise and the Houris who
attend the Faithful.And, speaking of houris!--see who's here!"Croyden glanced up--to see Elaine Cavendish and Charlotte Brundage
standing in the doorway.VIII

STOLEN


"This is, truly, a surprise!""Who would ever
have thought of meeting you two in this out-of-the-way place.""From abroad?--I haven't gone," said Croyden.She looked at him steadily a moment--Macloud was talking to Miss
Brundage."I don't know--it's difficult of
adjustment.--What brings you here, may I inquire?""We were in Washington and came over with the Westons to the Officers'
Hop to-night--given for the Secretary of something.He's one of the
Cabinet."Oh, I see," he answered; the relief in his voice would have missed a
less acute ear."To a tea at the Superintendent's, when the Westons join us."I haven't acquired the Washington habit,--yet!""Then go to the dance with us--Colin!"We're not invited--if that cuts any figure."Weston, I've presumed to ask Mr.Croyden to join our party to-night.""The Admiral and I shall be delighted to have them," Mrs.Weston
answered--"Will they also go with us to the tea?Macloud and Croyden accompanied them to the Academy gates, and then
returned to the hotel.In the narrow passage between the news-desk and the office, they
bumped, inadvertently, into two men.There were mutual excuses, and the
men went on.An hour or so later, Macloud, having changed into his evening clothes,
came into Croyden's room and found him down on his knees looking under
the bureau, and swearing vigorously.he said; "you _are_ a true pirate's heir!Old Parmenter,
himself, couldn't do it better."And incidentally searching for this, I suppose?"picking up a pearl
stud from under the bed."And when you've sufficiently recovered your equanimity," Macloud went
on, "you might let me see the aforesaid Parmenter's letter.I want to
cogitate over it."grinding in the stud--"my coat's on the chair,
yonder."exclaimed Croyden, ramming the last stud
home."Where would you think it is--in the small change pocket?""I'll do it with----" He stopped.said Macloud, holding up the coat.Croyden's fingers flew to the breast pocket--empty!to the other
pockets--no wallet!He seized his trousers; then his waistcoat--no
wallet."I had it when we left the Weston party--I felt
it in my pocket, as I bent to tie Miss Cavendish's shoe.""Then, it oughtn't to be difficult to find--it's lost between the
Sampson Gate and the hotel.I'm going out to search, possibly in the
fading light it has not been noticed.You telephone the office--and
then join me, as quickly as you can get into your clothes."He dashed out and down the stairs into the Exchange, passing midway,
with the barest nod, the Weston party, nor pausing to answer the
question Miss Cavendish flung after him.Once on the rear piazza, however, he went slowly down the broad white
steps to the broad brick walk--the electric lights were on, and he
noted, with keen regret, how bright they made it--and thence to the
Sampson Gate.He inquired of the guard stationed there,
and that, too, proving unavailing, left directions for its return, if
found.If any one reads that letter, the jig is up for us....
Here!boys," to a crowd of noisy urchins, sitting on the coping along
the street, "do you want to make a dollar?"The enthusiasm of the response, not to mention its unanimity,
threatened dire disaster to Macloud's toilet.You all can have a chance for
it.I've lost a wallet--a pocketbook--between the gate yonder and the
hotel.A moment later Croyden came down the
walk."I haven't got it," Macloud said, answering his look."I've been over
to the gate and back, and now I've put these gamins to work.They will
find it, if it's to be found."And what's more, there won't
be anything doing here--we shall never find the letter, Macloud.""That's my fear," Macloud admitted."Somebody's _stolen_ it," Croyden answered."Precisely!--do you recall our being jostled by two men in the narrow
corridor of the hotel?Well, then is when I lost my wallet.I wasn't in a position to drop it from my pocket."Macloud's hand sought his own breast pocket and stopped."I forgot to change, when I dressed.Maybe the other fellow made off
with mine.I'll go and investigate--you keep an eye on the boys."He flung them some small coins, thereby precipitating a scramble and a
fight, and they went slowly in."There is just one chance," he continued."Pickpockets usually abstract
the money, instantly, and throw the book and papers away.It may be the case here--they, likely, didn't
examine the letter, just saw it _was_ a letter and went no further.""That won't help us much," said Croyden."It will be found--it's only a
question of the pickpockets or some one else.""But the some one else may be honest."The finder may advertise--may look you up at the hotel--may----"

"May bring it back on a gold salver!"Our only hope is that the thief threw away the letter, and that
no one finds it until after we have the treasure.The man isn't born
who, under the circumstances, will renounce the opportunity for a half
million dollars.""Well, at the worst, we have an even chance!We know the
directions without the letter.Don't be discouraged, old man--we'll win
out, yet."It was sport--an adventure and a problem to work out, nothing
more.Now, if we have some one else to combat, so much greater the
adventure, and more intricate the problem.""Or isn't it well to get
them into it?"If we could jug the thieves quickly, and
recover the plunder, it might be well.On the other hand, they might
disclose the letter to the police or to some pal, or try even to treat
with us, on the threat of publicity.On the whole, I'm inclined to
secrecy--and, if the thieves show up on the Point, to have it out with
them.There are only two, so we shall not be overmatched.Moreover, we
can be sure they will keep it strictly to themselves, if we don't force
their hands by trying to arrest them."We will simply
advertise for the wallets to-morrow, as a bluff--and go to work in
earnest to find the treasure."They had entered the hotel again; in the Exchange, the rocking chair
brigade and the knocker's club were gathered."Why can't a hotel ever be free of
them?""Let's go in to dinner--I'm
hungry."The tall head-waiter received them like a host himself, and conducted
them down the room to a small table.A moment later, the Weston party
came in, with Montecute Mattison in tow, and were shown to one nearby,
with Harvey's most impressive manner.An Admiral is some pumpkins in Annapolis, when he is on the _active_
list.Weston and the young ladies looked over and nodded; Croyden and
Macloud arose and bowed.They saw Miss Cavendish lean toward the
Admiral and say a word."We would be glad to have you join us," said he, with a man's fine
indifference to the fact that their table was, already, scarcely large
enough for five."I am afraid we should crowd you, sir.Thank you!--we'll join you
later, if we may," replied Macloud.A little time after, they heard Mattison's irritating voice, pitched
loud enough to reach them:

"I wonder what Croyden's doing here with Macloud?""I
thought you said, Elaine, that he had skipped for foreign parts, after
the Royster smash, last September."Mattison, I _thought_ he had gone abroad, but I most
assuredly did not say, nor infer, that he had _skipped_, nor connect
his going with Royster's failure!""If you
must say unjust and unkind things, don't make other people responsible
for them, please.Then he shot a look
at his friend."I don't mind," said Croyden."They may think what they please--and
Mattison's venom is sprinkled so indiscriminately it doesn't hurt.They dallied through dinner, and finished at the same time as the
Westons.Croyden walked out with Miss Cavendish."I couldn't help overhearing that remark of Mattison's--the beggar
intended that I should," said he--"and I want to thank you, Elaine, for
your 'come back' at him.""I'm sorry I didn't come back harder," said she."And if you prefer me not to go with you to the Hop to-night don't
hesitate to say so--I'll understand, perfectly.The Westons may have
got a wrong impression----"

"The Westons haven't ridden in the same motor, from Washington to
Annapolis, with Montecute for nothing; but I'll set you straight, never
fear.We are going over in the car--there is room for you both, and
Mrs.It's the fashion to
go early, here, it seems."Zimmerman was swinging his red-coated military band through a dreamy,
sensuous waltz, as they entered the gymnasium, where the Hops, at the
Naval Academy, are held.The bareness of the huge room was gone
entirely--concealed by flags and bunting, which hung in brilliant
festoons from the galleries and the roof.Myriads of variegated lights
flashed back the glitter of epaulet and the gleam of white shoulders,
with, here and there, the black of the civilian looking strangely
incongruous amid the throng that danced itself into a very kaleidoscope
of color.The Secretary was a very ordinary man, who had a place in the Cabinet
as a reward for political deeds done, and to be done.He represented a
State machine, nothing more.Quality, temperament, fitness, poise had
nothing to do with his selection.His wife was his equivalent, though,
superficially, she appeared to better advantage, thanks to a Parisian
modiste with exquisite taste, and her fond husband's bottomless bank
account.Having passed the receiving line, the Westons held a small reception of
their own.The Admiral was still upon the active list, with four years
of service ahead of him.He was to be the next Aide on Personnel, the
knowing ones said, and the orders were being looked for every day.Therefore he was decidedly a personage to tie to--more important even
than the Secretary, himself, who was a mere figurehead in the
Department.And the officers--and their wives, too, if they were
married--crowded around the Westons, fairly walking over one another in
their efforts to be noticed.Croyden asked Miss Cavendish as they joined
the dancing throng.they're hailing the rising sun," she said--and explained:
"They would do the same if he were a mummy or had small-pox.(The watchword, in the Navy, is "grease."From the moment you enter the
Academy, as a plebe, until you have joined the lost souls on the
retired list, you are diligently engaged in greasing every one who
ranks you and in being greased by every one whom you rank.And the more
assiduous and adroit you are at the greasing business, the more
pleasant the life you lead.The man who ranks you can, when placed over
you, make life a burden or a pleasure as his fancy and his disposition
dictate.Consequently the "grease," and the higher the rank the greater
the "grease," and the number of "greasers.")"Well-named!--dirty, smeary, contaminating business," said Croyden."And the best 'greasers' have the best places, I reckon.I prefer the
unadorned garb of the civilian--and independence.I'll permit those
fellows to fight the battles and draw the rewards--they can do both
very well."He did not get another dance with her until well toward the end--and
would not then, if the lieutenant to whom it belonged had not been a
second late--late enough to lose her."We are going back to Washington, in the morning," she said."Much as I'd like to do it.""Are you sure you would like to do it?""Geoffrey!--what is this business which keeps you here--in the East?""Which means, I must not ask, I suppose.""Will you tell me one thing--just one?""Has Royster &
Axtell's failure anything to do with it?""And is it true that you are seriously embarrassed--have lost most of
your fortune?"They danced half the length of the room before he replied.She, alone, deserved to know--and, if she cared, would
understand."I am not, however, in
the least embarrassed--I have no debts.""And is it 'business,' which keeps you?--will you ever come back to
Northumberland?""Yes, it is business that keeps me--important business.Whether or not
I shall return to Northumberland, depends on the outcome of that
business.""Why did you leave without a word of farewell to your friends?""Has any of my friends
cared--sincerely cared?Has any one so much as inquired for me?""They thought you were called to Europe, suddenly," she replied."For which thinking you were responsible, Elaine.""It was because of the failure," she said."You were the largest
creditor--you disappeared--there were queries and rumors--and I thought
it best to tell."On the contrary," he said, "I am very, very grateful to know that some
one thought of me."Another moment, and he might
have said what he knew was folly.Her body close to his, his arm around
her, the splendor of her bared shoulders, the perfume of her hair, the
glory of her face, were overcoming him, were intoxicating his senses,
were drugging him into non-resistance.The spell was broken not an
instant too soon.He shook himself--like a man rousing from dead
sleep--and took her back to their party.The next instant, as she was whirled away by another, she shot him an
alluringly fascinating smile, of intimate camaraderie, of
understanding, which well-nigh put him to sleep again."I would that I might get such a smile," sighed Macloud."She has the same smile for all
her friends, so don't be silly.""Moreover, if it's a different smile, the field is open."Can a man be scratched _after_ he has won?"Croyden retorted, as he turned away to search for his
partner.When the Hop was over, they said good-night at the foot of the stairs,
in the Exchange."We shall see you in the morning, of course--we leave about ten
o'clock," said Miss Cavendish."We shall be gone long before you are awake," answered Croyden.And,
when she looked at him inquiringly, he added: "It's an appointment that
may not be broken.""Well, till Northumberland, then!"But Elaine Cavendish's only reply was a meaning nod and another
fascinating smile.As they entered their own rooms, a little later, Macloud, in the lead,
switched on the lights--and stopped!"Hello!--our wallets, by all that's good!"cried Croyden, springing in, and stumbling over Macloud in
his eagerness.He seized his wallet!--A touch, and the story was told.No need to
investigate--it was as empty as the day it came from the shop, save for
a few visiting cards, and some trifling memoranda."You didn't fancy you would find it?""No, I didn't, but damn!"But the pity is that
won't help us.They've got old Parmenter's letter--and our ready cash
as well; but the cash does not count.""It counts with me," said Croyden."I'm out something over a
hundred--and that's considerable to me now.he asked.... "Thank you!--The
office says, they were found by one of the bell-boys in a garbage can
on King George Street.""If they mean fight, I reckon we can
accommodate them.IX

THE WAY OUT


"I've been thinking," said Croyden, as they footed it across the Severn
bridge, "that, if we knew the year in which the light-house was
erected, we could get the average encroachment of the sea every year,
and, by a little figuring, arrive at where the point was in 1720.It
would be approximate, of course, but it would give us a
start--something more definite than we have now.For all we know
Parmenter's treasure may be a hundred yards out in the Bay.""And if we don't find the date, here," he added, "we
can go to Washington and get it from the Navy Department.An inquiry
from Senator Rickrose will bring what we want, instantly.""At the same time, why shouldn't we get permission to camp on the Point
for a few weeks?""It would make it easy for us to
dig and investigate, and fish and measure, in fact, do whatever we
wished.Having a permit from the Department, would remove all
suspicion."We're fond of the open--with a town convenient!""I know Rickrose well, we can go down this afternoon and see
him.He will be so astonished that we are not seeking a political
favor, he will go to the Secretary himself and make ours a personal
request.Then we will get the necessary camp stuff, and be right on the
job."They had passed the Experiment Station and the Rifle Range, and were
rounding the shoal onto the Point, when the trotting of a rapidly
approaching horse came to them from the rear."Suppose we conceal ourselves, and take a look," suggested Macloud.He pointed to some rocks and bushes that lined the roadway.The next
instant, they had disappeared behind them.A moment more, and the horse and buggy came into view.In it were two
men--of medium size, dressed quietly, with nothing about them to
attract attention, save that the driver had a hook-nose, and the other
was bald, as the removal of his hat, an instant, showed."Yes--I'll bet a hundred on it!""Greenberry Point seems far off," said the driver--"I wonder if we can
have taken the wrong road?""This is the only one we could take," the other answered, "so we must
be right."Cussing himself for----" The rest was lost in the noise of the team.said Croyden, lifting himself from a bed of stones
and vines.And if I had a gun, I'd give the
Coroner a job with both of you.""It would be most effective," he said."But could we carry it off
cleanly?The law is embarrassing if we're detected, you know.""I never was more so," the other answered."I'd shoot those scoundrels
down without a second's hesitation, if I could do it and not be
caught.""However, your idea isn't
half bad; they wouldn't hesitate to do the same to us."They won't hesitate--and, what's more, they have the nerve to
take the chance.They waited until they could no longer hear the horse's hoof-falls nor
the rumble of the wheels.Then they started forward, keeping off the
road and taking a course that afforded the protection of the trees and
undergrowth.Presently, they caught sight of the two men--out in the
open, their heads together, poring over a paper, presumably the
Parmenter letter."It is not as easy finding the treasure, as it was to pick my pocket!""There's the letter--and there are the men who stole
it.And we are helpless to interfere, and they know it.It's about as
aggravating as----" He stopped, for want of a suitable comparison.Hook-nose went on to the Point, and
stood looking at the ruins of the light-house out in the Bay; the other
turned and viewed the trees that were nearest."Much comfort you'll get from either," muttered Croyden.Hook-nose returned, and the two held a prolonged conversation, each of
them gesticulating, now toward the water, and again toward the timber.Finally, one went down to the extreme point and stepped off two hundred
and fifty paces inland.Bald-head pointed to the trees, a hundred yards away, and shook his
head.Then they produced a compass, and ran the
additional distance to the North-east."You'll have to work your brain a bit," Croyden added."The letter's
not all that's needed, thank Heaven!You've stolen the one, but you
can't steal the other."The men, after consulting together, went to the buggy, took out two
picks and shovels, and, returning to the place, fell to work.After a short while, Bald-head threw down his pick and hoisted himself
out of the hole."He's got a glimmer of intelligence, at last," Croyden muttered.The discussion grew more animated, they waved their arms toward the
Bay, and toward the Severn, and toward the land.Hook-nose slammed his
pick up and down to emphasize his argument."They'll be doing the war dance, next!""'When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,'" Croyden
quoted."_More_ honest men, you mean--the comparative degree.""Life is made up of comparatives," said Croyden.as Bald-head faced about and stalked back to the buggy."He has simply quit digging a hole at random," Macloud said."My Lord,
he's taking a drink!"Bald-head, however, did not return to his companion.Instead, he went
out to the Bay and stood looking across the water toward the bug-light.Then he turned and looked back toward the timber.The land had been driving inward by the
encroachment of the Bay--the beeches had, long since, disappeared, the
victims of the gales which swept the Point.There was no place from
which to start the measurements.Beyond the fact that, somewhere near
by, old Parmenter had buried his treasure, one hundred and ninety years
before, the letter was of no definite use to anyone.From the Point, he retraced his steps leisurely to his companion, who
had continued digging, said something--to which Hook-nose seemingly
made no reply, save by a shovel of sand--and continued directly toward
the timber."I think not--these bushes are ample protection.Lie low.... He's not
coming this way--he's going to inspect the big trees, on our left....
They won't help you, my light-fingered friend; they're not the right
sort."After a time, Bald-head abandoned the search and went back to his
friend.Throwing himself on the ground, he talked vigorously, and,
apparently, to some effect, for, presently, the digging ceased and
Hook-nose began to listen.At length, he tossed the pick and shovel
aside, and lifted himself out of the hole.After a few more
gesticulations, they picked up the tools and returned to the buggy.said Croyden, as they drove away.At the first heavy
undergrowth, they stopped the horse and proceeded carefully to conceal
the tools.This accomplished, they drove off toward the town."I wish we knew," Croyden returned."It might help us--for quite
between ourselves, Macloud, I think we're stumped.""Our first business is to move on Washington and get the permit,"
Macloud returned."Hook-nose and his friend may have the Point, for
to-day; they're not likely to injure it.They were passing the Marine Barracks when Croyden, who had been
pondering over the matter, suddenly broke out:

"We've got to get rid of those two fellows, Colin!""We agree that we dare not have them arrested--they would blow
everything to the police.And the police would either graft us for all
the jewels are worth, or inform the Government.""Yes, but we may have to take the risk--or else divide up with the
thieves."There is another way--except killing them,
which, of course, would be the most effective.Why shouldn't we
imprison them--be our own jailers?"Macloud threw away his cigarette and lit another before he replied,
then he shook his head."Too much risk to ourselves," he said."Somebody would likely be killed
in the operation, with the chances strongly favoring ourselves.I'd
rather shoot them down from ambush, at once.""That may require an explanation to a judge and jury, which would be a
trifle inconvenient.I'd prefer to risk my life in a fight.Then, if it
came to court, our reputation is good, while theirs is in the rogues'
gallery."Think over it, while we're going to
Washington and back; see if you can't find a way out.Either we must
jug them, securely, for a week or two, or we must arrest them.On the
whole, it might be wiser to let them go free--let them make a try for
the treasure, unmolested.When they fail and retire, we can begin.""Your last alternative doesn't sound particularly attractive to me--or
to you, either, I fancy.""This isn't going to be a particularly attractive quest, if we want to
succeed," said Croyden."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways, I
reckon--blood and violence and sudden death.We'll try to play it
without death, however, if our opponents will permit.Such title, as
exists to Parmenter's hoard, is in me, and I am not minded to
relinquish it without a struggle.I wasn't especially keen at the
start, but I'm keen enough, now--and I don't propose to be blocked by
two rogues, if there is a way out.""And the way out, according to your notion, is to be our own jailers,
think you?""Well, we can chew on it--the manner of
procedure is apt to keep us occupied a few hours."They took the next train, on the Electric Line, to Washington, Macloud
having telephoned ahead and made an appointment with Senator
Rickrose--whom, luckily, they found at the Capital--to meet them at the
Metropolitan Club for luncheon.At Fourteenth Street, they changed to a
Connecticut Avenue car, and, dismounting at Seventeenth and dodging a
couple of automobiles, entered the Pompeian brick and granite building,
the home of the Club which has the most representative membership in
the country.Macloud was on the non-resident list, and the door-man, with the memory
for faces which comes from long practice, greeted him, instantly, by
name, though he had not seen him for months.Macloud, Senator Rickrose just came in," he said.He was very tall, with a tendency
to corpulency, which, however, was lost in his great height; very
dignified, and, for one of his service, very young--of immense
influence in the councils of his party, and the absolute dictator in
his own State.Inheriting a superb machine from a "matchless
leader,"--who died in the harness--he had developed it into a well
nigh perfect organization for political control.All power was in his
hands, from the lowest to the highest, he ruled with a sway as absolute
as a despot.His word was the ultimate law--from it an appeal did not
lie.he said to Macloud, dropping a hand on his
shoulder."I haven't seen you for a long time--and, Mr.Croyden, I
think I have met you in Northumberland.I'm glad, indeed, to see you
both."said Macloud, a little later, when they had finished
luncheon."I want to ask a slight favor--not political however--so it
won't have to be endorsed by the organization.""In that event, it is granted before you ask."Have the Secretary of the Navy issue us a permit to camp on Greenberry
Point.""Across the Severn River from Annapolis."Rickrose turned in his chair and glanced over the dining-room.Then he
raised his hand to the head waiter."Has the Secretary of the Navy had luncheon?""Yes, sir--before you came in.""We would better go over to the Department, at once, or we shall miss
him," he said."Chevy Chase is the drawing card, in the afternoon."The reception hour was long passed, but the Secretary was in and would
see Senator Rickrose.He came forward to meet him--a tall, middle-aged,
well-groomed man, with sandy hair, whose principal recommendation for
the post he filled was the fact that he was the largest contributor to
the campaign fund in his State, and his senior senator needed him in
his business, and had refrigerated him into the Cabinet for safe
keeping--that being the only job which insured him from being a
candidate for the Senator's own seat.said Rickrose, "my friends want a permit to camp for
two weeks on Greenberry Point."said the Secretary, vaguely--"that's somewhere out
in San Francisco harbor?""Not the Greenberry Point they mean," the Senator replied."It's down
at Annapolis--across the Severn from the Naval Academy, and forms part
of that command, I presume.It is waste land, unfortified and wind
swept."Why wouldn't the Superintendent give you a
permit?""We didn't think to ask him," said Macloud."We supposed it was
necessary to apply direct to you.""They are not familiar with the customs of the service," explained
Rickrose, "and, as I may run down to see them, just issue the permit to
me and party.The Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee is inspecting
the Point, if you need an excuse."none whatever--however, a duplicate will be forwarded to the
Superintendent.If it should prove incompatible with the interests of
the service," smiling, "he will inform the Department, and we shall
have to revoke it."He rang for his stenographer and dictated the permit.When it came in,
he signed it and passed it over to Rickrose."Anything else I can do for you, Senator?""Not to-day, thank you, Mr.asked Macloud, when they were in
the corridor.Hunting the Parmenter
treasure, with the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee as a
disinterested spectator, was rather startling, to say the least."The campaign opens next week, and I'm drawn as
a spell-binder in the Pacific States.That figurehead was ruffling his
feathers on you, just to show himself, so I thought I'd comb him down a
bit.If you do, wire me, and
I'll get busy.I've got to go over to the State Department now, so I'll
say good-bye--anything else you want let me know.""Next for a sporting goods shop," said Macloud as they went down the
steps into Pennsylvania Avenue; "for a supply of small arms and
ammunition--and, incidentally, a couple of tents.We can get a few
cooking utensils in Annapolis, but we will take our meals at Carvel
Hall.I think neither of us is quite ready to turn cook.""We can hire a horse and
buggy by the week, and keep them handy--better get a small tent for the
horse, while we're about it."They went to a shop on F Street, where they purchased three tents of
suitable size, two Winchester rifles, and a pair of Colt's military
revolvers with six-and-a-half inch barrels, and the necessary
ammunition.These they directed should be sent to Annapolis
immediately.Cots and blankets could be procured there, with whatever
else was necessary.They were bound up F Street, toward the Electric Station, when Macloud
broke out."If we had another man with us, your imprisonment idea would not be so
difficult--we could bag our game much more easily, and guard them more
securely when we had them.As it is, it's mighty puzzling to
arrange."said Croyden, "but where is the man who is
trustworthy--not to mention willing to take the risk, of being killed
or tried for murder, for someone else's benefit?They're not many like
you, Colin."A man, who was looking listlessly in a window just ahead, turned away.He bore an air of dejection, and his clothes, while well cut, were
beginning to show hard usage and carelessness.Macloud observed--"and on his uppers!""He is down hard, a little money
with a small divide, if successful, will get him.Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak or to go on.Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.Mighty kind in one who lost so much
through us.""You were not to blame--Royster's responsible, and he's gone----"

"To hell!""Meanwhile, can I do anything for
you?You're having a run of hard luck, aren't you?"For a moment, Axtell did not answer--he was gulping down his thoughts."I've just ten dollars to my name.I came here
thinking the Congressmen, who made piles through our office, would get
me something, but they gave me the marble stare.I was good enough to
tip them off and do favors for them, but they're not remembering me
now.Do you know where I can get a job?""Yes--I'll give you fifty dollars and board, if you will come with us
for two weeks."Will I take it?--Well, rather!""What you're to do, with Mr.Macloud and myself, we will disclose
later.If, then, you don't care to aid us, we must ask you to keep
silence about it.""I'll do my part, and ask
no questions--and thank you for trusting me.You're the first man since
our failure, who hasn't hit me in the face--don't you think I
appreciate it?"nodding toward
a small bag, which Axtell had in his hand."Then, come along--we're bound for Annapolis, and the car leaves in ten
minutes."X

PIRATE'S GOLD BREEDS PIRATE'S WAYS


That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment at Carvel Hall, they
took Axtell into their confidence--to a certain extent (though, again,
he protested his willingness simply to obey orders).They told him, in
a general way, of Parmenter's bequest, and how Croyden came to be the
legatee--saying nothing of its great value, however--its location, the
loss of the letter the previous evening, the episode of the thieves on
the Point, that morning, and their evident intention to return to the
quest."Now, what we want to know is: are you ready to help us--unaided by the
law--to seize these men and hold them prisoners, while we search for
the treasure?""We may be killed in the attempt, or we
may kill one or both of them, and have to stand trial if detected.If
you don't want to take the risk, you have only to decline--and hold
your tongue."said Axtell, "I don't want you to pay me a
cent--just give me my board and lodging and I'll gladly aid you as long
as necessary.It's a very little thing to do for one who has lost so
much through us.You provide for our defense, if we're apprehended by
the law, and _that_" (snapping his fingers) "for the risk.""We'll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you please," he said; "and, if
we recover what Parmenter buried, you'll not regret it."The following morning saw them down at the Point with the equipage and
other paraphernalia.The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis for
the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees, ditched them, received
their pay, climbed into the wagons and rumbled away to town--puzzled
that anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point when they had the
price of a hotel, and three square meals a day."It looks pretty good," said Croyden, when the canvases were up and
everything arranged--"and we shan't lack for the beautiful in nature.This is about the prettiest spot I've ever seen, the Chesapeake and the
broad river--the old town and the Academy buildings--the warships at
anchor--the _tout ensemble!_ We may not find the treasure, but, at
least, we've got a fine camp--though, I reckon, it is a bit breezy when
the wind is from the Bay.""I wonder if we should have paid our respects to the Superintendent
before poaching on his preserves?""Hum--hadn't thought of that!""Better go in and show
ourselves to him, this afternoon.He seems to be something of a
personage down here, and we don't want to offend him.These naval
officers, I'm told, are sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due
their rank.""On that score, we've got some rank
ourselves to uphold."the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, of the
United States Senate, is with us.According to the regulations, is it
his duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.""However, the Superintendent has a copy
of the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if
he's quiescent, it's up to us.""You should have been a diplomat,
Croyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!""A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to
Annapolis," he said."Look at the one cutting through the water there,
midway across!"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer
in uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put
about and went chugging upstream."We didn't seem to please him," remarked Macloud, gazing after the
boat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the
Experiment Station."We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet
either way," said Macloud."Otherwise, they wouldn't have
despatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As
soon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a
few steps forward to meet him."Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am
one of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr."The
Superintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself
and the Academy at your disposal."(He was instructed to add, that
Captain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to
Washington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we
appreciate his kindness exceedingly," Macloud answered."We're camping
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed."So far, we're making delightful progress," said Croyden; "but there
are breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our
absence."They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the
tools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit
to the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was
disclosed."Not very likely," replied Macloud, "with half a million at stake.They
probably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them
back again.""Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?""They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one
else.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is
like the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.""If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would
help some!""Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins
of the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel
last night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry
Point in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals
toward the ruins."What do you make the distance from the land?""About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over
water.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.""It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the
near side of the ruins," said Croyden."Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!""I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your
breakfast," answered Croyden."Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.""Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It
gives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain
figures.""Now, what's the rest
of the figures--or haven't you worked it out?""The calculation is of value only on the
assumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the
light-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now
three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing
ninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and
twenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three
and a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred
and ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and
a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the
Point, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.""Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet
Parmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore
line, instead of seven hundred and fifty!""As the Point from year to year slipped
into the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,
gradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since
Parmenter's beeches went down.""Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and
made a note of it on the letter?""Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,
likely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point
seemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large
trees to landward.""Next let us measure back eighty-five feet," said Croyden, producing a
tape-line.... "There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But
where were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them
intersect?"...said Macloud--"where were the trees, and where
did the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got
it?"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over."I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they
disclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,
it matters little where the others were, in determining the direction
of the treasure.The _objective point_ will
change as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_
will vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who
understand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we
are correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----"

He opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran
his eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he
glanced at Macloud and smiled."The treasure is buried," he repeated--"the treasure is buried--_out in
the Bay_.""Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult," he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low
bluff at the water's edge."Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here," he said, "and Parmenter
buried the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.""Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not
only encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.""It's hard to dig in water," Macloud remarked."It's apt to fill in the
hole, you know.""Don't be sarcastic," Croyden retorted."I'm not responsible for the
Bay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.""Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're
based," Macloud replied."And as the former seem to be accurate, and
the latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.""At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or
close on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the
entire Point.""You have given us a mighty plausible start," said Macloud.as a
buggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents."It is Hook-nose back again," said Macloud."Come to pay a social call,
I suppose!"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.""Come to treat with us--to share the treasure."By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,
immediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered
along landward."And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know
them," added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the
occupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the
horse over in front of them."Which of you men is named Croyden?""Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your
handle, isn't it?""You have the advantage of me," Croyden assured him."Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a
little private talk?"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and
continuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following."If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to
accommodate you," said the fellow."I thought, however, you'd rather
keep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,
all right, my friend!""Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,"
said Croyden."When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and
give them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,
with one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only
with small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before
they can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the
plea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with
impunity.""This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!""I would that I
were in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for
the war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can
just as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,
myself.""I can't," said Macloud."But there seem to be no rules to the game
we're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity."As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head
and got out."Leave it to me, I'll get them together," Croyden answered.... "You
wish to see me, privately?""I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not."said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was
pitched a trifle to one side.... "Now, sir, what is it?"as the flaps
dropped behind them."You've a business way about you, which I like----" began Hook-nose."Come to the point--what do
you want?""There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!"You lost a letter recently----"

"Not at all," Croyden cut in."I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,
are the thief.""I, or my pal--it matters not which," the fellow replied easily."Now,
what we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you've found it.""Well, let me tell you there won't
be any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I
don't agree with one."Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish."Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, "hitch the horse and come in."And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally
retired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their
backs to the entrance."I'm glad to make your acquaint----" began Smith."There is no need for an introduction," Croyden interrupted curtly."You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down
to business, if you please!""You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're
hell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that
this treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the
Government's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong
box--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own
flippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,
when the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.""Rather a good bargain for you," said Croyden."We supply the
information, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,
pray?""For our silence, and an equal share in the information.You have
doubtless forgot that we have the letter now.""Better
half a big loaf than no loaf at all.""I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know
it.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's
money belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States
land.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,
and the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!""If you're one to throw away good money, I miss
my guess.""I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill
might as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you
uncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget
that we come in for a share."His ears were
primed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--"Let us
have them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.""You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's
covered his pal.--Croyden cried--"None of that,
Hook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your
brains like chickenfeed."His own big revolver was sticking out of
Macloud's pocket."Now, I'll look after you, while my
friends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a
bullet down his throat.""Hands behind your back, Bald-head," commanded Axtell, briskly.Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on."Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!"Now, I'll do for you," Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.With Croyden's and Macloud's guns both covering him, the fellow was
quickly secured."With your permission, we will search you," said Croyden."Macloud, if
you will look to Mr.Smith, I'll attend to Hook-nose.We'll give them a
taste of their own medicine.""I don't care to shoot a prisoner, but I'll do
it without hesitation.It's going to be either perfect quiet or
permanent sleep--and you may do the choosing."He slowly went through Hook-nose's clothes--finding a small pistol,
several well-filled wallets, and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the
Parmenter letter.Macloud did the same for Bald-head."You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars from Mr.Macloud and
one hundred and eight from me," said Croyden."You may now have the
privilege of returning it, and the letter.If you make no more trouble,
lie quiet and take your medicine, you'll receive no further harm.If
you're stubborn, we'll either kill you and dump your bodies in the Bay,
or give you up to the police.The latter would be less trouble, for,
without the letter, you can tell your story to the Department, or
whomever else you please--it's your word against ours--and you are
thieves!""How long are you going to hold us prisoners?"asked Bald-head--"till
you find the treasure?"And luck is with you," Hook-nose sneered."At present, it _is_ with us--very much with us, my friend," said
Croyden."You will excuse us, now, we have pressing business,
elsewhere."When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:

"Doesn't our recovery of Parmenter's letter change things very
materially?""It seems to me it does," Croyden answered."Indeed, I think we need
fear the rogues no longer--we can simply have them arrested for the
theft of our wallets, or even release them entirely.""Arrest is preferable," said Macloud."It will obviate all danger of
our being shot at long range, by the beggars.Let us put them where
they're safe, for the time.""But the arrest must not be made here!""We can't
send for the police: if they find them here it would give color to
their story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.""Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while you go to town and
arrange for their apprehension--say, just as they come off the Severn
bridge."What if they don't cross the Severn--what if they scent our game, and
keep straight on to Baltimore?They can abandon their team, and catch a
Short Line train at a way station.""Then the Baltimore police can round them up.They've lost Parmenter's letter; haven't anything to substantiate their
story.Furthermore, we have a permit for the Chairman of the Naval
Affairs Committee and friends to camp here.I think that, now, we can
afford to ignore them--the recovery of the letter was exceedingly
lucky."said Macloud--"you're the one to be satisfied; it's a
whole heap easier than running a private prison ourselves."Croyden looked the other's horse over carefully, so he could describe
it accurately, then they hitched up their own team and he drove off to
Annapolis."I told the Mayor we had passed two men on
the Severn bridge whom we identified as those who picked our pockets,
Wednesday evening, in Carvel Hall--and gave him the necessary
descriptions.He recognized the team as one of 'Cheney's Best,' and
will have the entire police force--which consists of four men--waiting
at the bridge on the Annapolis side.""They are
there, now, so we can turn the prisoners loose."Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers, and returned to the
tent--to be greeted with a volley of profanity which, for fluency and
vocabulary, was distinctly marvelous.Gradually, it died away--for want
of breath and words."In the cuss line, you two are the real
thing.Why didn't you open up sooner?--you shouldn't hide such
proficiency from an admiring world."Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.Bald-head, however,
remained quiet, and there was a faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he
caught the humor of the situation.They were severely cramped, and in
considerable pain, but their condition was not likely to be benefited
by swearing at their captors.said Croyden, as Hook-nose took a fresh start.Now, if you'll be quiet a moment, like
your pal, we will tell you something that possibly you'll not be averse
to hear.... So, that's better.We're about to release you--let you go
free; it's too much bother to keep you prisoners.These little toy guns
of yours, however, we shall throw into the Bay, in interest of the
public peace.Now, you may arise and shake yourselves--you'll, likely,
find the circulation a trifle restricted, for a few minutes."Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made no reply, Bald-head
grinned broadly."Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will escort you to your
carriage!And with the two thieves in front, and the three revolvers bringing up
the rear, they proceeded to the buggy.XI

ELAINE CAVENDISH


"May we have seen the last of you!"said Macloud, as the buggy
disappeared among the trees; "and may the police provide for you in
future.""And while you're about it," said Croyden, "you might pray that we find
the treasure--it would be quite as effective."Now, to resume where those rogues interrupted us.We had the jewels located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.They must be, according to our theory, either on the bank or in the
Bay.We can't go at the water without a boat.Shall we tackle the land
at once?or go to town and procure a boat, and be ready for either in
the morning.""I have an idea," said Macloud."Don't let it go to waste, old man, let's have it!""If you can give up hearing yourself talk, for a moment, I'll try!""It is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point
by day may, probably will, provoke comment and possibly investigation
as well.Then as soon as dusky
Night has drawn her robes about her----"

"Oh, Lord!"ejaculated Croyden, with upraised hands."Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her robes about her," Macloud
repeated, imperturbably, "we set to work, by the light of the silvery
moon.We arouse no comment--provoke no investigation.When morning
dawns, the sands are undisturbed, and we are sleeping as peacefully as
guinea pigs.""And if there isn't a moon, we will set to work by the light of the
silvery lantern, I reckon!""And, when we tackle the water, it will be in a silver boat and with
silver cuirasses and silver helmets, a la Lohengrin.""And I suppose, our swan-song will be played on silver flutes!""There won't be a swan-song--we're going to find Parmenter's treasure,"
said Macloud.Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town, stopping at the North end
of the Severn bridge to hire a row-boat,--a number of which were drawn
up on the bank--and to arrange for it to be sent around to the far end
of the Point.At the hotel, they found a telephone call from the
Mayor's office awaiting them.The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor said, and they had been
sent to Baltimore.The Chief of Detectives happened to be in the
office, when they were brought in, and had instantly recognized them as
well-known criminals, wanted in Philadelphia for a particularly
atrocious hold-up.He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief
take them back with him, thus saving the County the cost of a trial,
and the penitentiary expense--as well as sparing Mr.Croyden and his
friend much trouble and inconvenience in attending court.He had had
them searched, but found nothing which could be identified.Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.That night, and every night for the
next three weeks, they kept at it.They dug up the entire zone
of suspicion--it being loose sand and easy to handle.On the plea that
a valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while fishing, they
dragged and scraped the bottom of the Bay for a hundred yards around.Nothing smiled on them but the weather--it had
remained uniformly good until the last two days before.Then there had
set in, from the North-east, such a storm of rain as they had never
seen.The very Bay seemed to be gathered up and dashed over the Point.They had sought refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of
wind and water came up the Chesapeake.As it grew fiercer,--and a <DW64>
sent out for information returned with the news that their tents had
been blown away, and all trace of the camp had vanished--it was
decided that the quest should be abandoned."We knew from the first it
couldn't succeed.""But we wanted to prove that it couldn't succeed," Macloud observed."If you hadn't searched, you always would have thought that, maybe, you
could have been successful.Now, you've had your try--and you've
failed.It will be easier to reconcile yourself to failure, than not to
have tried.""In other words, it's better to have tried and lost, than never to have
tried at all," Croyden answered.it's over and there's no profit
in thinking more about it.We have had an enjoyable camp, and the camp
is ended.I'll go home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel box
he buried down on Greenberry Point.""I think I'll go with you," said Macloud."To Hampton--if you can put up with me a little longer."A knowing smile broke over Croyden's face."Maybe!--and maybe it is just you.At any rate, I'll come if I may."You know you're more than welcome, always!""I'll go out to Northumberland to-night, arrange a few
matters which are overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I can
get away."*       *       *       *       *

The next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the wide doorway of the
Tuscarora Trust Company, he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.There isn't a handy dinner man around, with you and Geoffrey
both away.Dine with us this evening, will you?--it will be strictly
_en famille_, for I want to talk business."he thought, as, having accepted, he went on
to the coupon department."It has to do with that beggar Croyden, I
reckon."*       *       *       *       *

And when, the dinner over, they were sitting before the open grate
fire, in the big living room, she broached the subject without
timidity, or false pride."You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden's affairs than any one
else, Colin," she said, crossing her knees, in the reckless fashion
women have now-a-days, and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue silk
stockings, with an unconscious consciousness that was delightfully
naive."And I want to ask you something--or rather, several things."Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into the fire, and waited."I, naturally, don't ask you to violate any confidence," she went on,
"but I fancy you may tell me this: was the particular business in which
Geoffrey was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success or a
failure?""Did he tell you anything concerning
it?""Only that his return to Northumberland would depend very much on the
outcome.""Well, it wasn't a success; in fact, it was a complete failure.""I do not mean, where is he this minute, but where
is he in general--where would you address a wire, or a letter, and know
that it would be received?"He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit another."I am not at liberty to tell," he said."Then, it is true--he is concealing himself.""Not exactly--he is not proclaiming himself----"

"Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts to his Northumberland
friends, you mean?""Are there such things as friends, when one
has been unfortunate?""I can answer only for myself," she replied earnestly."I believe you, Elaine----"

"Then tell me this--is he in this country or abroad?""In this country," he said, after a pause."Is he in want,--I mean, in want for the things he has been used to?""He is not in want, I can assure you!--and much that he was used to
having, he has no use for, now."Why did he leave Northumberland so suddenly?"He was forced to give up the old life, so he chose
wisely, I think--to go where his income was sufficient for his needs."She was silent for a while, staring into the blaze.He did not
interrupt--thinking it wise to let her own thoughts shape the way."You will not tell me where he is?"she said suddenly, bending her blue
eyes hard upon his face.I ought not to have told you he was not abroad.""This business which you and he were on, in Annapolis--it failed, you
say?""And is there no chance that it may succeed, some time?""But may not conditions change--something happen----" she began."It is the sort that does not happen.In this case, abandonment spells
finis.""Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?""On the contrary, he was very sanguine--it looked most promising
then."He blew ring after ring of smoke, and
waited, patiently.He was the friend, he saw, now.Croyden was the lucky fellow--and would not!Well, he had
his warning and it was in time.Since she was baring her soul to him,
as friend to friend, it was his duty to help her to the utmost of his
power.Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up."I have bought all the stock, and the remaining bonds of the Virginia
Development Company, from the bank that held them as collateral for
Royster & Axtell's loan," she said.I didn't
appear in the matter--my broker bought them in _your_ name, and paid
for them in actual money."She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him on the cheek."I am, also, Geoffrey Croyden's friend, but
there are temptations which mortal man cannot resist."she smiled, leaning over the back of his chair, and
putting her head perilously close to his--"but I trust you--though I
shan't kiss you again--at least, for the present.Now, you have been so
_very_ good about the bonds, I want you to be good some more.He held his hands before him, to put them out of temptation."Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how quickly I do it!""It might prove my power, but I should lose my friend," she whispered.it's
already granted, that you should know, Elaine.""You're a very sweet boy," she said, going back to her seat.But that you're a very sweet girl, needs no
proof--unless----" looking at her with a meaning smile."I should accept it as such," he averred--"whenever you choose to
confer it.""_Confer_ smacks of reward for service done," she said."Will it bide
till then?""Wait--If you choose such pay, the----"

"I choose no pay," he interrupted."Then, the reward will be in kind," she answered enigmatically."I want
you----" She put one slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it,
meditatively, while the firelight stole covert glances at the silken
ankles thus exposed."I want you to purchase for me, from Geoffrey
Croyden, at par, his Virginia Development Company bonds," she said.I will give you a check, now----"

"Wait!"he said; "wait until he sells----"

"You think he won't sell?""I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as to the purchaser--in
plain words, that it isn't either you or I. We can't give Geoffrey
money!The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows only too
well.""I had thought of that," she said, "but, isn't it met by this very
plan?Your broker purchases the bonds for your account, but he,
naturally, declines to reveal the identity of his customer.You can,
truthfully, tell Geoffrey that _you_ are not buying them--for you're
not.And _I_--if he will only give me the chance--will assure him that
I am _not_ buying them from him--and you might confirm it, if he
asked."It's juggling with the facts--though true on the face," said
Macloud, "but it's pretty thin ice we're skating on."He may take the two hundred
thousand and ask no question.""You don't for a moment believe that!""It _is_ doubtful," she admitted."And you wouldn't think the same of him, if he did.""So, we are back to the thin ice.I'll do what I can; but, you forgot,
I am not at liberty to give his address to my brokers.I shall have to
take their written offer to buy, and forward it to him, which, in
itself will oblige me, at the same time, to tell him that _I_ am not
the purchaser.""I leave it entirely to you--manage it any way you see fit.All I ask,
is that you get him to sell.It's horrible to think of Geoffrey being
reduced to the bare necessities of life--for that's what it means, when
he goes 'where his income is sufficient for his needs.'""It's unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly worse for a woman--to
go from luxury to frugality, from everything to relatively nothing is
positively pathetic.However, Croyden is not suffering--he has an
attractive house filled with old things, good victuals, a more than
competent cook, and plenty of society.He has cut out all the
non-essentials, and does the essentials economically.""You speak of your own knowledge,
not from his inferences?""Our own in the aggregate
or differentiated?"he laughed; "but quite the equal of our own
differentiated.If Croyden were a marrying man--with sufficient income
for two--I should give him about six months, at the outside.""And how much would you give one with sufficient for two--_yourself_,
for instance?""Just long enough to choose the girl--and convince her of the propriety
of the choice.""And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?""As soon as I can get through here,--probably in a day or two.""Then, we may look for the new Mrs.Macloud in time for the holidays, I
presume.--Sort of a Christmas gift?""About then--if I can pick among so many, and she ratifies the pick.""No!--there are so many I didn't have time to more than look them over.When I go back, I'll round them up, cut out the most likely, and try to
tie and brand her.""One would think, from your talk, that
Geoffrey was in a cowboy camp, with waitresses for society."He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette."And nothing can induce you to tell me the location of the camp?""Let us try the bond matter, first.If
he sells, I think he will return; if not, I'll then consider telling.""You're a good fellow, Colin, dear!"she whispered, leaning over and
giving his hand an affectionate little pat."You're so nice and
comfortable to have around--you never misunderstand, nor draw
inferences that you shouldn't.""Which means, I'm not to draw inferences now?""Nor at any other time," she remarked."Will be forthcoming," with an alluring smile."I've a mind to take part payment now," said he, intercepting the hand
before she could withdraw it.whisking it loose, and darting around a table.With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts and fled--around chairs,
and tables, across rugs, over sofas and couches--always manoeuvring to
gain the doorway, yet always finding him barring the way;--until, at
last, she was forced to refuge behind a huge davenport, standing with
one end against the wall.he demanded, coming slowly toward her in the
cul de sac."I'll be merciful," he said."It is five steps, until I reach
you--One!--Will you yield?""Four----"

Quick as thought, she dropped one hand on the back of the davenport;
there was a flash of slippers, lingerie and silk, and she was across
and racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving him only the echo
of a mocking laugh.she counted, tauntingly, from the hall."Why don't you
continue, sir?""I'll be good for to-night, Elaine--you
need have no further fear."She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a bantering look came into
her eyes."I'm not much afraid of you, now--nor any time," she answered."But you
have more courage than I would have thought, Colin--decidedly more!"XII

ONE LEARNED IN THE LAW


It was evening, when Croyden returned to Hampton--an evening which
contained no suggestion of the Autumn he had left behind him on the
Eastern Shore.It was raw, and damp, and chill, with the presage of
winter in its cold; the leaves were almost gone from the trees, the
blackening hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery.As he passed up
the dreary, deserted street, the wind was whistling through the
branches over head, and moaning around the houses like spirits of the
damned.He turned in at Clarendon--shivering a little at the prospect.He was
beginning to appreciate what a winter spent under such conditions
meant, where one's enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed by the
bounds of comparatively few houses and few people--people, he
suspected, who could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly
of life and amusement, even if they tried.Their ways were sufficient
for them; they were eminently satisfied with what they had; they could
not comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and would have no patience
with it.He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton, when contrasted with the
brightness of Northumberland.The theatres, the clubs, the constant
dinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with all that it
comprehended, compared with an occasional dinner, a rare party,
interminable evenings spent, by his own fireside, alone!To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden, and Miss Lashiel, and
Miss Tilghman, would be available, when they were home.But the winter
was when they went visiting, he remembered, from late November until
early April, and, at that period, the town saw them but little.There
was the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse than nothing--an
opportunity to get mellow and to gamble, innocent enough to those who
were habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had fallen, by
adversity, from better things....

However, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank God!And the dear girls
were not going for a week or so, he hoped.And, when the worst came, he
could retire to the peacefulness of his library and try to eke out a
four months' existence, with the books, and magazines and papers.Moses held open the door, with a bow and a flourish, and the lights
leaped out to meet him.It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a
bright house, a full larder, faithful servants--and supper ready on the
table, and tuned to even a Clubman's taste."Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington's at home?"he asked, the coffee
on and his cigar lit.her am home, seh, I seed she herse'f dis mornin' cum down
de parf from de front poach wid de dawg, seh."Croyden nodded and went across the hall to the telephone.Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.--Yes, she intended to be
home all evening.She would be delighted to see him and to hear a full
account of himself.He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in finishing his cigar and
changing his clothes--and he wondered whether it was the girl, or the
companionship, or the opportunity to be free of himself?A little of
all three, he concluded.... But, especially, the _girl_, as she came
from the drawing-room to meet him."So you have really returned," she said, as he bowed over her slender
fingers."We were beginning to fear you had deserted us.""You are quite too modest," he replied."You don't appreciate your own
attractions."The "you" was plainly singular, but she refused to see it."Our own attractions require us to be modest," she returned; "with
a--man of the world.""Whatever I may have been, I am, now, a man of
Hampton.""You can never be a man of Hampton.""Why not, if I live among you?""If you live here--take on our ways, our beliefs, our mode of thinking,
you may, in a score of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,
where the true like must start, _never_!"You've been bred differently, used to
different things, to doing them in a different way.We do things
slowly, leisurely, with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern
rush, and bustle, and hurry.You are a man of the world--I repeat
it--up to the minute in everything--never lagging behind, unless you
wish.You never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.We never
do anything to-day that can be put off till to-morrow.""And which do you prefer, the to-day or the to-morrow?""It depends on my humor, and my location, at the time--though, I must
admit, the to-day makes for thrift, and business, and success in
acquiring wealth.""And success also in getting rid of it.It is a return toward the
primitive condition--the survival of the fittest.There must be losers
as well as acquirers."she exclaimed, "that one must lose in order
that another may gain.""But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria," he smiled, "it will continue
so to be.Why, even in Baltimore, they----"

"Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country town!""With half a million population, it is as
provincial as Hampton, and thanks God for it--the most smug,
self-satisfied, self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its
cobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou
air about everything.""Because it happens to be on the main line between Washington and the
North.""At least, the people are nice, barring a few mushrooms who are making
a great to-do.""Yes, the people _are_ delightful!--And, when it comes to mushrooms,
Northumberland has Baltimore beaten to a frazzle."Northumberland society must be exceedingly large!""It is--but it's not overcrowded.About as many die every day, as are
born every night; and, at any rate, they don't interfere with those who
really belong--except to increase prices, and the cost of living, and
clog the avenue with automobiles."but whither it leads no one knows--to the devil,
likely--or a lemon garden.""'Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they shall be peaches in
Heaven!'""What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will be," he replied."I'm afraid you don't appreciate the great honor the lady did you, in
condescending to view the _treasures_ of Clarendon, and to talk about
them afterward.To hear her, she is the most intimate friend you have
in Hampton."he said, "I'm glad you told me.Somehow, I'm always drawing
lemons.""Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A lemon or not a lemon?""If you could but see yourself at this moment, you would not ask," he
said, looking at her with amused scrutiny.The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine figure in the simple
pink organdie, the slender ankles, the well-shod feet--a lemon!"But as I can't see myself, and have no mirror handy, your testimony is
desired," she insisted."Then you can't have any objection----"

"If you bring Miss Erskine in?""----if I take you there for a game of Bridge--shall we go this very
evening?""I don't wish--and we are growing very silly.Come, tell
about your Annapolis trip."It's a queer old town, Annapolis--they call it the 'Finished City!'It's got plenty of landmarks, and relics, but nothing more.If it were
not for the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would be only a lot of
ruins, lost in the sand.No one on
the streets, no one in the shops, no one any place.--Deserted--until
there's a fire."But, with the
autumn and the Academy in session, the town seemed very much alive.We
sampled 'Cheney's Best,' Wegard's Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream
Chapel.""You've been to Annapolis, sure!""There's only one thing
more--did you see Paul Jones?"You can't find him without the aid of a
detective or a guide.""No one!--and there is the shame.We accepted the vast labors and the
money of our Ambassador to France in locating the remains of America's
first Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy and a warship to bring them back;
we received them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over them.And then, when the spectators had departed--assuming they were to be
deposited in the crypt of the Chapel--we calmly chucked them away on a
couple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft Hall, as we would an
old broom or a tin can.That's _our_ way of honoring the only Naval
Commander we had in the Revolution.It would have been better, much
better, had we left him to rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in
France--lost, save in memory, with the halo of the past and privacy of
death around him.""And why didn't we finish the work?""Why bring him here,
with the attendant expense, and then stop, just short of completion?Why didn't we inter him in the Chapel (though, God save me from burial
there), or any place, rather than on trestles under a stairway in a
midshipmen's dormitory?""Because the appropriation was exhausted, or because the Act wasn't
worded to include burial, or because the Superintendent didn't want the
bother, or because it was a nuisance to have the remains around--or
some other absurd reason.At all events, he is there in the cellar, and
he is likely to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up by the
Bay.The junket to France, the parade, the speeches, the spectacular
part are over, so, who cares for the entombment, and the respect due
the distinguished dead?""I don't mean to be disrespectful," he observed, "but it's hard luck to
have one's bones disturbed, after more than a hundred years of
tranquillity, to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be orated
over, and sermonized over, and, then, to be flung aside like old junk
and forgot.However, we have troubles of our own--I know I have--more
real than Paul Jones!He may be glad he's dead, so he won't have any to
worry over.In fact, it's a good thing to be dead--one is saved from a
heap of worry.""A daily struggle to procure fuel sufficient
to keep up the fire."Why not make an end of life, at once?""Sometimes, I'm tempted," he admitted."It's the leap in the dark, and
no returning, that restrains, I reckon--and the fact that we must face
it alone.You have
begged the question, or what amounts to it.But, to return to
Annapolis; what else did you see?""Then you know what I saw," he replied.This isn't the day of the rapier and the mask."She half closed her eyes and looked at him through the long lashes."What were you doing down on Greenberry Point?"I was in Annapolis--I saw your name on the
register--I inquired--and I had the tale of the camp.No one, however,
seemed to think it queer!"Camping out is entirely natural," Croyden answered."With the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs?""A party which until five days ago he had not joined--at least, so the
Superintendent told me, when I dined at his house.He happened to
mention your name, found I knew you--and we gossiped.Perhaps we
shouldn't, but we did."he didn't seem even to wonder at your being there----"

"But _you_ did?""It's the small town in me, I suppose--to be curious about other people
and their business; and it was most suspicious."First, you hire a boat and cross the Bay direct from
Hampton to Annapolis.Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose, a
permit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp on Greenberry Point.Third, you actually do camp, there, for nearly, or quite three weeks.Why go clear to the Western Shore, and choose a
comparatively inaccessible and exposed location on United States
property, if the idea were only a camp?Why not camp over on Kent
Island, or on this coast?Anywhere, within a few miles of Hampton,
there are scores of places better adapted than Greenberry Point."With a series of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion
you wish--you're not bound by the probabilities.""You're simply obscuring the point," she insisted."In this instance,
my premises are facts which are not controverted.Why?----" She held up her hand.I'm simply
'chaffing of you,' don't you know!""With just a lingering curiosity, however," he added."A casual curiosity, rather," she amended."Which, some time, I shall gratify.You've trailed me down--we _were_
on Greenberry Point for a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet--and
it's likely a failure."Croyden, I don't wish to know.It was a mistake to refer
to it.I should simply have forgot what I heard in Annapolis--I'll
forget now, if you will permit."You can't forget, if you would--and I
would not have you, if you could.Moreover, I inherited it along with
Clarendon, and, as you were my guide to the place, it's no more than
right that you should know.I think I shall confide in you--no use to
protest, it's got to come!""You are determined?--Very well, then, come over to the couch in the
corner, where we can sit close and you can whisper."She put out her hand and led him--and he
suffered himself to be led.when they were seated, "you may begin.Once upon a time----" and
laughed, softly."I'll take this, if you've no immediate use for it,"
she said, and released her hand from his."I shall want it back, presently, however.""Do you, by any chance, get all you want?"Else I would have kept what I already had."She put her hands behind her, and faced around."Well,--once upon a time----" Then he stopped."I'll go over to the
house and get the letter--it will tell you much better than I can.You
will wait here, _right here_, until I return?"She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile."Won't it be enough, if I am here _when_ you return?"When he came out on the piazza the rain had ceased, the clouds were
gone, the temperature had fallen, and the stars were shining brightly
in a winter sky.He strode quickly down the walk to the street and crossed it diagonally
to his own gates.As he passed under the light, which hung near the
entrance, a man walked from the shadow of the Clarendon grounds and
accosted him.Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance."With your permission, I will accompany you to your house--to which I
assume you are bound--for a few moments' private conversation."He was about thirty years of age, tall
and slender, was well dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight
top-coat, and a derby hat.His face was ordinary, however, and Croyden
had no recollection of ever having seen it--certainly not in Hampton."I'm not in the habit of discussing business with strangers, at night,
nor of taking them to my house," he answered, brusquely."If you have
anything to say to me, say it now, and be brief."Some one may hear us," the man objected."Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you would have objection.""You'll say it quickly, and here, or not at all," snapped Croyden."It's scarcely a subject to be discussed on the street," he observed,
"but, if I must, I must.Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter?Well, the business concerns a certain letter--need I
be more explicit?""If you wish to make your business intelligible.""As you wish," he said, "though it only consumes time, and I was under
the impression that you were in a hurry.However: To repeat--the
business concerns a letter, which has to do with a certain treasure
buried long ago, on Greenberry Point, by the said Robert Parmenter.Do
I make myself plain, now, sir?""Your language is entirely intelligible--though I cannot answer for the
facts recited."The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:

"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,
with two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that
would deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then
departed, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of
weather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to
communicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up."Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was
not ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure."Croyden only smiled, and waited, too."Very good!--we will proceed," said the stranger."The jewels were
found on Government land.It makes no difference whether recovered on
the Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am
informed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,
it being the owner in fee of the land.""I have devoted my spare moments to the study of
the law----"

"And how to avoid it," Croyden interjected."And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it," he replied,
suggestively."Let us take up that phase, if it please you."asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination
to laugh."Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find
to the Government.""We are arriving, now, at the pith of the
matter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and
multiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in
valuation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million
dollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share."Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?""If you prefer blackmail to
share, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as
illegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better
but either obtains the same end.Call it what you
will--but _pay_.""If you are not familiar
with the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten
you.""I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly," the stranger
replied, refusing to be hurried or flustered."The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on
Government land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If
declared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as
the Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed
on, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,
you have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further
deductions.""No!--it's quite unnecessary," Croyden remarked."Your fellow thieves
went into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,
almost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the
conversation.""I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,
you have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be
essential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's
testimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as
you are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.""There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but
which is, unfortunately, not a fact," said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly."We don't ask you to acknowledge the
finding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget
everything.""My good man, I'm speaking the truth!""Maybe it's
difficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I
only wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share
it, even with a blackmailer!""I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you."And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to
Clarendon.XII

I COULD TELL SOME THINGS


When Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the
escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only
a little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain
in attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held
him.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy
with the sleep from which he had been aroused."Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?""Fur de Lawd, seh!Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se
gun-shy, seh.""Yass, seh, I has don hit.""And you could do it again, if necessary?""I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,
seh, mons'us unsuttin!""Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?""Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you
know enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.""Hi!--I sut'n'y does!seh, I sut'n'y does!"said the <DW64>, with a
broad grin."There is a revolver, yonder, on the table," said Croyden, indicating
one of those they used on Greenberry Point."It's a self-cocker--you
simply pull the trigger and the action does the rest."Yass, seh, I onderstands," said Moses."Bring it here," Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried
it to his master."I'll show you the action," said Croyden."Here, is the ejector,"
throwing the chamber out, "it holds six shots, you see: but you never
put a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the
trigger, it's likely to be discharged."Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,
who took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty
years, and more."What do yo warn me to do, seh?""I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to
get in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to
Captain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely
you will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even
if you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once."Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.""You're to shoot anyone who tries to
_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any
one else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang
away.""Sut'n'y, seh!I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang
away right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?"Croyden smiled--"but you be ready for them, Moses, be
ready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies."as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,
"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'
likes hit, dat's whar I don'."Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick
return to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the
hall."I had a mind not to wait here," she said; "you were an inordinately
long time, Mr."I was, and I admit
it--but it can be explained.""Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!"said
he, and gave her the letter."Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing
in a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,
she turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden."Most extraordinary in its
ordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?""Now, I'll tell you about it.""First, tell me where you obtained this letter?""I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at
Clarendon," he answered."This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find
it!"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of
the letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode
of the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the
thieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together
with the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the
well-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not
interrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she
break the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring
thoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back
log glowed fitfully."What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?"In the
words of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!""But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the
treasure," she objected."Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the
least.""He is not acting alone," she persisted."He has confederates--they may
attack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure."this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!""We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.""Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways!""Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this
connection.""Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and
tortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?""However, I
put Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting
up the neighborhood.""Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!""Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as
vaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being
tortured.""You know best, I suppose," she said--"but you've had your warning--and
pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding
the treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?""Possibly half a million," he filled in."If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I
shall be only too glad to consider it.""You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?""And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?"She puckered her brows in thought.He regarded her with an amused
smile."I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again," she
announced--"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a
second, or a third, or even many seekings.""If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend
a lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the
extreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made
the best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of
exploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we
failed.It will make nothing for success to try again.""Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred
feet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been
eaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared
with the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,
except by accident.""Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she
handed it back, and shook her head."It's too much for my poor brain," she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,
and, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall
return the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it."You can return it to its hiding place," she reflected, "but you can't
cease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the
landmarks were there?"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left
until the 'extremity of need.'""Probably," she said, "the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor
to observe the exact terms of the bequest."It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!""You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!"And with all that money, the Duvals
might have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other
conditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might
have never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!"In the realm of pure conjecture," he answered."It is idle to theorize
on the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the
what-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I
have consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something
else.What have you been doing in those three weeks?"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,
with an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,
and I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression
you had made!""We both were learning, it seems," he replied."I don't quite understand," she said."You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but
this impression is much more than the ordinary kind!"_"Merci, Monsieur_," she scoffed."No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on
whom to make an impression.""You mean, Mr.--Macloud?""For he's coming back----"

"To Hampton?""To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.""I shall believe you, when I see him!""He is, I think, coming solely on your account.""But you're not quite sure?--oh!"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.""So you're confiding in me--how clever!""I could tell some things----"

"Which are fables.""----but I won't--they might turn your head----"

"Which way--to the right or left?""----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but
twice----"

"Once!""Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave
you a name, the instant he saw you----"

"How kind of him!""He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'""Was that the first time you had noticed it?""No, you most assuredly do not!"she said, "I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!""Because, it would be false to your friend."Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.""At least, I so view it," with a teasingly fascinating smile."Don't you think that you protest over-much?""If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't
you?'""And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'""Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr."I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say
that you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than
enough for two, I can assure you.""And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?""What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?""I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens," he insisted."If it will advantage any----"

"I didn't say so," she interrupted.

"----I can tell you----"

"Many fables, I don't doubt!"----that we have been rather intimate, for a few years, and I have
never before known him to exhibit particular interest in any woman.""'Why don't you speak for yourself, John,'" she quoted, merrily."Because, to be frank, I haven't enough for two," he answered, gayly.But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected the faintest note of
regret.And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered about her--whether she
was dark or fair, tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor--and whether they loved each other--or whether it
was he, alone, who loved--or whether he had not permitted himself to be
carried so far--or whether--then, she dropped asleep.Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp look-out for anyone
under the trees around the house.He found Moses in the library,
evidently just aroused from slumber by the master's door key."No one's bin heah, seh, 'cep de boy wid dis'spatch," he hastened to
say.Croyden tore open the envelope:--It was a wire from Macloud, that he
would be down to-morrow.yass, seh!--I'se pow'ful glad yo's back, seh.Nothin' I kin
git yo befo I goes?""You're a good soldier, Moses, you didn't
sleep on guard."I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden, wide awake all de time,
seh.Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light, and went slowly
upstairs--giving not a thought to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he
had met outside.His mind was busy with Elaine Cavendish--their last
night on the moonlit piazza--the brief farewell--the lingering pressure
of her fingers--the light in her eyes--the subdued pleasure, when they
met unexpectedly in Annapolis--her little ways to detain him, keep him
close to her--her instant defense of him at Mattison's scurrilous
insinuation--the officers' hop--the rhythmic throb of the melody--the
scented, fluttering body held close in his arms--the lowered head--the
veiled eyes--the trembling lashes--his senses steeped in the fragrance
of her beauty--the temptation well-nigh irresistible--his resolution
almost gone--trembling--trembling----

                  *       *       *       *       *

The vision passed--music ceased--the dance was ended.Sentiment
vanished--reason reigned once more.to think of her, to dream of the past, even.But
it is pleasant, sometimes, to be a fool--where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one's self to pay the piper.XIV

THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE


Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for his host a great batch of
mail, which had accumulated at the Club."I thought of it at the last moment--when I was starting for the
station, in fact," he remarked."The clerk said he had no instructions
for forwarding, so I just poked it in my bag and brought it along.Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.I
can understand why you didn't leave an address, but not why I shouldn't
forward it.""I didn't care, when I left--and I don't care much, now--but I'm
obliged, just the same!""It's something to do; the most
exciting incident of the day, down here, is the arrival of the mail.The people wait for it, with bated breath.I am getting in the way,
too, though I don't get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland--so this is just circulars and
such trash."He took the package, which Macloud handed him, and tossed it on the
desk.Everybody is
back--everybody is hard up or says he is--everybody is full of lies,
as usual, and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.It's the telling,
not the believing that's the thing.the little cad Mattison is
engaged--Charlotte Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.""I don't envy her the job," Croyden remarked."She'll be privileged to draw
on his bank account, and that's the all important thing with her.He
will fracture the seventh commandment, and she won't turn a hair.She
is a chilly proposition, all right.""Well, I wish her joy of her bargain," said Croyden."May she have
everything she wants, and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey--and but very occasionally, then."He took up the letters and ran carelessly through them.he commented, as he consigned them, one by one,
to the waste-basket.Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his cigar smoke, and made no
comment.Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope--darkened on the
interior so as to prevent the contents from being read until opened.It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in Northumberland."'We own and offer, subject to
prior sale, the following high grade investment bonds.'He drew out the letter and looked at it,
perfunctorily, before sending it to rest with its fellows.--It wasn't
in the usual form.--He opened it, wider.--It was signed by the senior
partner.Croyden:

  "We have a customer who is interested in the Virginia Development
  Company.He has purchased the Bonds and the stock of Royster &
  Axtell, from the bank which held them as collateral.He is
  willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without any accrued
  interest, however.If you will consent to sell, the Company can
  proceed without reorganization but, if you decline, he will
  foreclose under the terms of the mortgage.We have suggested the
  propriety and the economy to him--since he owns or controls all
  the stock--of not purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told
  him it is worse than bad business to do so.But he refuses to be
  advised, insisting that he must be the sole owner, and that he is
  willing to submit to the additional expense rather than go
  through the tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale.We are
  prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds attached, or to
  pay cash on presentation and transfer.We shall be obliged for a
  prompt reply."Yours very truly,

                                              "R. J."What the devil!----"

He read it a second time.No, he wasn't asleep--it was all there,
typewritten and duly signed.Two hundred thousand dollars!--honor sight
draft, or pay cash on presentation and transfer!Then he passed it across to Macloud."Read this aloud, will you,--I want to see if I'm quite sane!"Macloud was at his favorite occupation--blowing smoke rings through one
another, and watching them spiral upward toward the ceiling.he said, as Croyden's words roused him from his
meditation.He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on that letter, trying to
explain the reason for the purchase, and the foolishly high price they
were offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden."It is typewritten, you haven't a chance to get wrong!"he exclaimed.... "So, I wasn't crazy: and either
Blaxham is lying or his customer needs a guardian--which is it?""I don't see that it need concern you, in the least, which it is," said
Macloud."Be grateful for the offer--and accept by wireless or any
other way that's quicker.""But the bonds aren't worth five cents on the dollar!""So much the more reason to hustle the deal through.You may have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.""There's something queer about that
letter."Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled."Blaxham's customer
may have the willies--indeed, he as much as intimates that such is the
case--but, thank God!we're not obliged to have a commission-in-lunacy
appointed on everybody who makes a silly stock or bond purchase.If we
were, we either would have no markets, or the courts would have time
for nothing else.take what the gods have given you
and be glad.You can return to
Northumberland, resume the old life, and be happy ever after;--or you
can live here, and there, and everywhere.You're unattached--not even a
light-o'-love to squander your money, and pester you for gowns and
hats, and get in a hell of a temper--and be false to you, besides.""No, I haven't one of them, thank God!""I've got
troubles enough of my own."It clears some of them away--if I take it."man, you're not thinking, seriously, of refusing?""It will put me on 'easy street,'" Croyden observed."And it comes with remarkable timeliness--so timely, indeed, as to be
suspicious.""It's a bona fide offer--there's no trouble on that score.""This," said Croyden: "I'm broke--finally.The Parmenter treasure is
moonshine, so far as I'm concerned.I'm down on my uppers, so to
speak--my only assets are some worthless bonds.along comes an
offer for them at par--two hundred thousand dollars for nothing!I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer--the only friend I
have in the world--and I did not think that even he was kind and
self-sacrificing enough to do it.--I'm grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can't take your money."exclaimed Macloud--"you do me too much credit, Croyden.I'm
ashamed to admit it, but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble.It's a way we have in Northumberland.We may
feel for misfortune, but it rarely gets as far as our pockets.Don't
imagine for a moment that I'm the purchaser.I'm not, though I wish,
now, that I was.""Will you give me your word on that?""I most assuredly will," Macloud answered.He looked at the
letter again.... "And, yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious....
I wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser of the stocks and
bonds, from the Trust Company who held them as collateral?""They won't know," said Macloud."Blaxham & Company bought them at the
public sale.""I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.""They never tell anything, as you are aware," Macloud replied."I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham & Company disclosed their
customer.""Yes, you could--and, likely, lose the sale; they won't disclose.However, that's your business," Macloud observed; "though, it's a pity
to tilt at windmills, for a foolish notion."Croyden creased and uncreased the letter--thinking.Macloud resumed the smoke rings--and waited.It had proved easier than
he had anticipated.Croyden had not once thought of Elaine
Cavendish--and his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....

At length, Croyden put the letter back in its envelope and looked up."I'll sell the bonds," he said--"forward them at once with draft
attached, if you will witness my signature to the transfer.But it's a
queer proceeding, a queer proceeding: paying good money for bad!""That's his business--not yours," said Macloud, easily.Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds from one of the
drawers."You can judge, from the place I keep them, how much I thought them
worth!"When they were duly transferred and witnessed, Croyden attached a draft
drawn on an ordinary sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.He placed them in an
envelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it
over to Macloud."I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts," he remarked, "so,
if you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope
for you."Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked
inquiringly at Croyden."Which, being interpreted," he said, "might mean that you don't intend
to return to Northumberland.""The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I
have not decided.""It's a question of resolution, not of inclination," Croyden answered."I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient
resolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to
live here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.""I've been thinking over the proposition you
recently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl," he said, "and you're all wrong.It's a question of the
respective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.I admit,
the man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support
_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that
she has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the
pair, I repeat.""Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?""I wish I could be so sure," Croyden reflected."Sure of the girl, as
well as sure of myself.""What are you doubtful about--yourself?"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously."I fancy I could manage myself," he said."Try her!--she's worth the try.""Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're
hipped on it!""All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when
you were home?""I did--I dined with her.""You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the
other eighth."Anything left of the
victim, afterward?""I refuse to become facetious," Macloud responded.Then he threw his
cigar into the grate and arose."It matters not what was said, nor who
said it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance
while you have it.""You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----" He walked across to
the window.He would let that sink in.--"How's the Symphony in Blue?""As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.""As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.""I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.""When did you arrange for me to go over?""She confided in you, I suppose?""Not directly; she let me infer it.""In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!""It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter
jewels."I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!""But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll
be present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.""Meet me to-night in dream-land!""Well, they're not
likely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.""Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was
returning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,
well-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do
you make of it?""It seems to me the fellow made it very plain," Macloud returned,
"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the
treasure.""Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,
you didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to
his theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are
within reach.He hoped, by that
means, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make
evidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,
by depositing them in any bank.""Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?""Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You
must remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to
conceal it, pending a Government investigation.""You make him a very canny gentleman.""No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he
is.""And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for
naught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!""It would be a bit annoying," observed Macloud, "to be visited by
burglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune
concealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.""Annoying?--not a bit!""I should rather enjoy the
sport of putting them to flight.""Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated."you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the
Eastern Shore.""The robber-barons were still on the
job in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about
to hold you up for ransom.""I wish I had your fine imagination," scoffed Croyden."I could make a
fortune writing fiction.""Oh, you're not so bad yourself!""It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!""Here, Moses," said Croyden, "take this letter down to the post
office--I want it to catch the first mail.""I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?""And of course you haven't told any one?""I suppose you even told
her the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.""I did!--and showed her the letter besides."No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four
hours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.""We don't have to remain," said Croyden, with affected seriousness--"there
are trains out, you know, as well as in.""I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.""But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!"You don't think I came down here to see only
you, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool
quest on Greenberry Point?"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden."Think she will retail it to the
dear public?""Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,
now!"said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of
the street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,
close fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was
swinging briskly back from town.Macloud watched her a moment in silence."The old man is done for, at last!""Look at the poise of the
head, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's
the way to tell a woman."You better go over," said his friend."It's about the tea hour, she'll
brew you a cup.""And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,
but I'll drink it!""She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!"laughed Croyden; "or make you a
high ball, or you can have it straight--just as you want.""I'll be over, presently," Croyden replied."_I_ don't want any tea,
you know.""Come along, as soon as you
wish--but don't come _too soon_."XV

AN OLD RUSE


Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,
somehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching
smile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much."And, if I may, to you," he replied.After them, you belong to _me_," she laughed."I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of
acquaintance," with a naive look."But not the order of--regard.""You did it very well for a--novice.""You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!""I can't accept, and be honest," he replied.Perchance,
you will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!""Perchance, I will--the high ball!"She looked at him, with a sly smile."You know that I have just returned," she said."I saw you in the
window at Clarendon.""And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.""And found you waiting for me--just as I expected."Peccavi!_" he said humbly."_Te absolvo!_" she replied, solemnly."Now, let us make a fresh
start--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we
return.""I can postpone the high ball for ever," he averred."Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?""Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----"

"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for
the deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year."Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair."Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk
sense.I think I can do it, if I try."As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street."I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy," he observed to
Macloud."I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is
that too soon?"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment."The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.""It's the favorite walk, here," she explained--"the most picturesque
and the smoothest.""To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,"
Macloud remarked."You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,
a place to spend a while, a place to visit.""Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?""I shouldn't think so," she replied."However, I can see how it would
induce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when
they're miserable.""Such people ought to live in a morgue," agreed Macloud."However
we're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.""There are some rather queer old headstones, out there," she said."Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be
the leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from
whom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to
understand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one
Robert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor
man, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making
supplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,
nor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?""Do you know who Parmenter was?""No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried
with them.""You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke
Duval.""His letter to Marmaduke Duval!""I didn't read any----"

"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry
Point," he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her."I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the
cutting on the tombstone----?""Is a victim begging mercy from him," said Macloud."I like that
Marmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,
bringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside
the place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is
friendship!""It was a sad day in Hampton
when the Colonel died.""He left a good deputy," Macloud replied."Croyden is well-born and
well-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these
days), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.""We are a bit clannish,
still.""Delighted to hear you confess it!"Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,
to Virginia."I knew there was some reason for my liking you!""Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?""Not if there be a means to increase it.""Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants
more!""Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male
sex?""In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!"Croyden told you of his experience, last
evening?""What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at
Clarendon.""But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate
means, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.""In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.""How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?""They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.""They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat," he added."They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you
intend to remain at Clarendon some time?""It depends--on how you treat me.""I engage to be nice for--two weeks!""Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.""And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to
extend the period."She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring."Do you wish me to--consider that?""If you will," he said, bending down."This pace is getting rather
brisk--did you notice it, Mr."You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.""Now don't misunderstand me----"

"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.""A Southern girl usually loves--horses," with a tantalizing smile."It is well for you this is a public street," he said."But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,"
he added."I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.""No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted."The fact that we are on a public street would
not restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you
knew it.""This is rather faster than the former going!""Any way, here is
the Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just
within the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you
Parmenter's grave?"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it
entirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and
blurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter."He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738," said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.""See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly," said Miss
Carrington, indicating with the point of her shoe."I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave," observed
Macloud, "but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much
blood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote
the letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of
that treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,
committed violence, were threatened with violence, did things
surreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and
violence----"

"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways," she quoted."It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered
in crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would
willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.""And is there no hope of finding it?""Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or
in the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.""My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,
doubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged
every inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more
than sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great
storm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash
it on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be
found.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by
Parmenter's grave!"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward
town.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching."I've been communing with Parmenter," said Macloud."I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?""He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.""That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and
seventy years."He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here."one more circumstance to prove the
letter speaks the truth.We find his
will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a
notice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his
body--or the place of its interment!what is really
worth while, we can't find.""Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings
temporarily," said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way
to the door."My dear Davila, so glad to see you!"Croyden,
we thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you
feel at home."I'm delighted to be back," said Croyden."The Carringtons seemed
genuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite
content to return," and he shook her hand, as though he meant it."Of course you may believe it," with an inane giggle."I'm going to
bring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some
day, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home," Croyden replied,
soberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and
presented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was
presented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she
had bubbled a bit more, departed."What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and" (observing smiles on
Croyden and Miss Carrington's faces) "what is she?""I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!""She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!""A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father," Miss
Carrington observed."But I hide it pretty well--while she's here," he protested."If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time."When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As
they approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to
have plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and
the gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library
or living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves
on edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder
at, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and
Josephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,
when Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had
forgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway."Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?""Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!""I didn't know it," said Croyden."Why yo sont 'im, seh.""Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly
arfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,
hows'ever.""Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what
repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I
s'pose.""Do you mean they were
in this house for two hours?"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows
Mistah Snyder well; he's bin heah off'n to wuk befo' yo cum, seh.But I
seed dem gwine th'oo de drawers, an' poundin on the floohs, seh.Dey
went down to de cellar, too, seh, an wuz dyar quite a while."seh, don't you t'inks I knows 'im?I knows 'im from de time
he wuz so high.""Go down and tell Snyder I want to see him, either
to-night or in the morning."The <DW64> bowed, and departed.Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the drawers were in
confusion.He glanced at the book-cases: the books were disarranged.He
turned and looked, questioningly, at Macloud--and a smile slowly
overspread his face."Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!""I wondered how long you would be coming to it!""It's the old ruse, in a slightly modified form.Instead of a
telephone or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the servant knew; a
little more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory
in results.""They are clever rogues," said Croyden--"and the disguise must have
been pretty accurate to deceive Moses.""Disguise is their business," Macloud replied, laconically."If they're
not proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.""And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.""We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,
so we'll see what they took."Every drawer was turned upside down, every
closet awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore
evidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been
missed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the
garret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up
and replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because
there was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking
for jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value."Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,"
said Croyden."I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them
I haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them."Abduction, maybe," Macloud suggested."Some night a black cloth will
be thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an
automobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading
memory.""Moral--don't venture out after sunset!""And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good
pair of legs," added Macloud."I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.""Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.""You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!"said Macloud, "it would be well to take some
precaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,
here--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible."Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.XVI

THE MARABOU MUFF


The next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest
themselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's
society, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid
equanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the
weather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the
blues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each
other.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company
bonds, and was once more on "comfortable street," as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,
he settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss
Carrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was
confident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that
was, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more
than firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that
he wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if
she decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and
quickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left
his address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was
dated Northumberland, and read:

  "My dear Colin--

  "It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to
  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to
  Northumberland?If he is not
  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come
  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his
  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted
  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am
  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness."Sincerely,

                                           "Elaine Cavendish."At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:

"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,
won't you go along?""I'm not going back to Northumberland," he said."I'll promise to come back
with you in two days at the most.""You can easily find your
way back.For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to
go away from it, _again_."And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:

"Well, I may not have to go."A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he
broached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working
around to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his
opportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without
hesitation."Croyden had two reasons for leaving
Northumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.""A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever
spend, indeed.""What was the
trouble--wouldn't she have him?""Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a
mere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.""If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?""He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not
for a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.To
marry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory
to that mutual respect which should exist between them.""We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!""What is it you want me to do?"she asked hastily--"or can I do
anything?""You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a
few days.""Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?""That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?""After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.""She will think it a trifle peculiar.""On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You
see, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she
wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left
Northumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but
me.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come
down and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your
invitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.""Come, we'll work out the letter
together.""Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?""Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy," she answered.--"Moreover, it
would be premature."The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her
breakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's
circulars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,
wherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a
particularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very
succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory."Ashburton,

                             "Hampton, Md."My dear Elaine:--

  "Mr.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the
  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise
  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this
  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey
  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is
  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be
  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply
  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We
  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit
  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your
  arrival--and come before the good weather departs."With lots of love,

                                          "Davila Carrington."Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled."Colin is rather a diplomat--he
managed it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably
worded.I'd forgotten about
Davila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow
found it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,
in answer:

  "Miss Davila Carrington,

       "Hampton, Md."I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud."Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands," she said."I'll cooperate, but you are the general.""Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then," Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station."You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years," said she,
laughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage."And you're the same I had forgotten," Davila replied."And it's just as delightful to be able to remember," was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss
Carrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently
Macloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her
charge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had
seen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she
hid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their
hats--and drove straight on."Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?""I noticed a bag in the trap,
however, so I reckon she's a guest.""Your opportunity, for the
solitariness of two, will be limited."It depends on what she is--I'm not
sacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.""Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to
plead for an excuse."I'm not worried about the guest," Macloud
remarked."There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which
promised very well," Croyden remarked."I think this would be a good
day to drop in for tea.""And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her
off on me, and preempt Miss Carrington."She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as
you would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was
something about her that seems familiar.""You're an adept in many things," laughed Macloud, "but, I reckon,
you're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've
seen the combination once or twice before on a woman.""Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?""I haven't the slightest objection----"

"Really!""----to your going along with me--I'm expected!"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and
see us, won't you?'""I trust so," said Macloud, placidly.--"But, as you're never coming
back to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.""I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before.""I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.""Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.""No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's
painted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.""Yes, I suppose we do," said Macloud."Though we get mighty sick of
seeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded
by the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share
of fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.""We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,
recently!""True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because
half a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,
top heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the
entire town is mad.""It's no worse than any other big town--and
the fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.They just
came all in a bunch.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the
fireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.""And isn't likely to very soon," Macloud responded, "with the whole
Municipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the
penitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and
graft!permeating every department of the civic life--and
published by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the
world to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly
suffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,
that so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is
quiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.""It's the same everywhere," said Croyden."No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the
councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the
street-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some
cigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less
irritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one
hundredths of its inhabitants."When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was
disappearing in a cloud of dust."The fellow driving, unless I am mightily
fooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of
Clarendon," he said."That's interesting--any one with him?""He isn't travelling around with
a petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.""It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?""He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.""I've got a very accurate memory for faces," said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be
declared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try
for them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door."Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!""Distinctly
proper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for
you, presently."*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her
face, when they were past the two men."It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!"The
fact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go
on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her."You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,"
Elaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room."And you made it very easy for me to come.""I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me
were I in a similar position.""I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----"

"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden
had told you of my difficulty----"

"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.""Not exactly that," said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very
attentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget
there are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take
him seriously.""I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he
doesn't!""He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to
gauge.""Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a
more indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even
an affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,
Davila!"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,
then.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in
company?""I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to
have a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged."Macloud is to come in a moment before
luncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr."Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?""He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.""If you've got him into the tea habit, you can
do what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.""I never tried him with tea," said Davila."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure.""It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *

OTHER FIELDS"]

MacLure got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which knew
that none had ever done one-tenth as much for it as this ungainly,
twisted, battered figure, and I have  seen a Drumtochty face
soften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising
the doctor's dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with
amazement.Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if
possible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never.His jacket and
waistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the
wet like a duck's back, and below he was clad in shepherd's tartan
trousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots.His shirt was
grey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a
tie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft
felt of four colors and seven different shapes.His point of distinction
in dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending
speculation."Some threep that he's worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,
an' a' mind masel him gettin' a tear ahint, when he was crossin' oor
palin', and the mend's still veesible."Ithers declare 'at he's got a wab o' claith, and hes a new pair made in
Muirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till
the new look wears aff."For ma ain pairt," Soutar used to declare, "a' canna mak up my mind,
but there's ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot
them: it wud be a shock tae confidence.There's no muckle o' the check
left, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin' in ye
ken that if human pooer can save yir bairn's life it 'ill be dune."The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and
rested partly on long experience of the doctor's resources, and partly
on his hereditary connection."His father was here afore him," Mrs.Macfadyen used to explain; "atween
them they've hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure
disna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a' wud like tae ask?"For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as
became a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the
hills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its
doctors."He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,
whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an'
a kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he
disna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye
richt, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the
ootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say
there's no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,"
concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a'll say this
for the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a
sharp meisture on the skin.""But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,"
and Mrs.Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr.Hopps' misadventures
of which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'
nicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he
writes 'immediately' on a slip o' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,
and he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen."'What's a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and
tire."'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower
mony berries.'[Illustration: "HOPPS' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]

"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----'

"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot."'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;
there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,
for he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him."A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,
an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come."'I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members
of this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate
for the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,
you must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a
previous intimation of your movement.I
sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and
find he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at
three o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,
like a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a
glance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to
sacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical
puerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent
any further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,
to have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the
court-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled
him for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his
ambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed
affections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source
of solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at
times the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is
past; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,
despair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:
and that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of
baffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate
himself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something
about his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent
youth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,
Coningsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been
a callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,
that at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby
forget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no
possibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,
'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of
friendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded
even more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released
him from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had
turned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But
surely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which
subsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to
her.He looked in for a moment at a club
to take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were
standing in a bow window.Cassilis say,

'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton
lord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr.Cassilis; 'I never know who is in
Parliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the
House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all
done a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his
friend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite
of every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his
aspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously
to himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was
fatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound
and desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection
of the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into
one bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his
horse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and
undisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the
contemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his
mission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,
prosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;
might not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his
endurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with
all his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his
daughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her
flush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,
if indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the
humbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever
could have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of
his companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of
his fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were
all these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of
life was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and
his was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his
grandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his
return.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then
so highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on
were on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank
and power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could
mistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,
perhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the
planets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation
of his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and
tranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like
seraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of
the pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of
humanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring
purpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition
to him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his
knowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he
possessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world
would recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the
principles of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation
would respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a
profound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct
which would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the
conscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his
life, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame
that was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,
on his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed
all that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all
the pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already
announced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to
become a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as
the master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.


Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which
had been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he
then believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber
satin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from
his brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines
in dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is
commonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid
palaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion
of the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet
carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and
Flora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to
her as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment
which distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression
was uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More
than once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,
collecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,
and more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the
matter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;
but my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My
Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter
the house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not
do what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know
exactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my
father is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down
the room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is
stupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about
the quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;
then she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one
of the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,
both waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to
transact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without
his interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,
confided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,
his expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could
create no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,
there is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which
everybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being
mixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine
management, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and
the airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in
life had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,
you could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'
which was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the
aristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His
parallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland
Hill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full
of passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew
tears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in
office with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against
that spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him
with information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could
have furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress
of democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on
Aldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of
the populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the
Crillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The
truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,
by an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the
maintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the
French revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he
wailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over
Nottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his
grandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,
and an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing
to prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the
Marquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the
course of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate
details of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was
highly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their
misunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that
seat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,
and over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate
solicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and
gave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect
upon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as
he received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,
played over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he
has ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought
Hellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the
younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of
itself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'
said Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,
since his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in
the same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this
boy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,
have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never
doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit
is plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is
no reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what
we want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid
me of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion
gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for
Darlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to
lose.What does he want with you to-day?''I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be
introduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love
for the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,
drinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you
will omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash
him to madness!Go,
go, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the
morning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit
when you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'

Lady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced
over the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too
interesting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years
since her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was
to lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with
a presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on
this day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to
meditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same
time dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the
gossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's
character or information, based on the haphazard observations of the
floating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her
influence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But
satisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of
her position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have
found it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;
and that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their
passions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are
rather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not
systematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is
not her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates
the respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent
from the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that
his life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had
made a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in
case of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all
hope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord
Monmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to
which his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had
alarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house
of Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and
perhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding
the limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start
contemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be
convinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately
be devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against
Coningsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been
considerably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time
there was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled
her with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel
assured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not
be a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not
be transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this
endeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish
all her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was
defending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and
more than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book
which more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless
rather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability
for the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,
she could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the
circumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time
stole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting
on her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found
the occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from
apprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,
had avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination
for the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a
state of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby
were with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that
gentleman appeared.'Now sit down and
tell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet
perplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little
distance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady
Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression
with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious
expression of features.As his Lordship
very justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my
own roof, or to what I can trust."''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire
confidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his
difficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the
establishment generally,' said Mr.Rigby, 'will allow the connection
that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,
now that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to
terminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his
establishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with
great impatience.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might
find some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German
bathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and
looking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if
malignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed
himself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were
to pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the
_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you
there, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment
take the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately
reach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to
interfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural
pallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And
he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your
Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly
before your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:
you know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has
left peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has
empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way
to consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,
should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;
that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which
shall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find
it convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some
hesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your
rights.''I beg your Ladyship's pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the
trustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's
executor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its
usual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he
remembered the good things which he enumerated.'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth.Your
master has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the
day that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,
'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An
office, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some
considerations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion
that it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we
have hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said
Lucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am
interfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled
it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my
interposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances
will assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were
it in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should
take up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish
everything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,
friendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the
preparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all
those that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,
your letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;
only too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way
contributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may
naturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,
will wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the
same advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he
added slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard
some treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I
have them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as
a foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,
having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,
and having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my
servant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you
mention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot
help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the
house, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with
his grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town
for the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day
at Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details
of their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had
certainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,
informed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could
not tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was
about to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time
been fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as
Coningsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All
this intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted
with the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the
whole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of
the occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of
was, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the
exception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from
Lord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was
also something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating
to young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but
pleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to
his grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced
in life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and
facility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was
always pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a
sentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on
the whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,
these were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more
precious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that
his grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He
was informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a
drawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he
soon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit
to his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval
that must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his
grandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest
spirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious
practical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And
well it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,
and no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and
no herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby
had exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the
furniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and
Clotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to
Ermengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage
was in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth
hoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he
informed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry
he was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and
tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with
you.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;
and as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong
impression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left
for his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment
that his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely
in his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at
the bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to
see him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of
something like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,
and an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do
anything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable
to Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is
often followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth
the separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his
meditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not
wish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in
some degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the
conventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear
nothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our
contracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such
undue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons
whose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of
existence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources
of enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of
Respectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is
termed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the
community as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient
circumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from
grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be
reminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in
his Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who
opened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who
was so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;
saw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices
of thrilling joyousness,--

'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of
elocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his
charms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really
had not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed
to the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,
however, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of
explanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;
and to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he
said,

'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the
bottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite
of all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification
and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually
made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a
month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to
receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling
as their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of
Villebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna
of celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist
nobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,
could tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,
which had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom
Lord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the
elixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the
bottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and
at one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances
still more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to
breathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described
as meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never
to encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had
become an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were
discussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,
many sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord
Beaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry
which might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed
his life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and
was almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally
accompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,
indeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less
inseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured
marriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not
yet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of
its ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her
acquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her
brother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she
would add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may
compromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe
that will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby
passed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding
on one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell
that impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and
the circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently
mentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his
desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,
apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the
darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,
though never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed
to be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject
fruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed
in the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and
cherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early
youth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some
moors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town
for Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,
who in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,
had surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague
mention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast
given, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks
of the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the
romances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls
colossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the
air with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on
turf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering
shades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to
celebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace
Lyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps
because I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when
Eustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was
convinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling
face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished
to have been more.'Happiness,' he
added, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,
we must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he
moved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse
in their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the
intelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter
to marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara
Isabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great
regard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the
influential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case
Coningsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might
counsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable
act.Ormsby, who seemed
occupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little
easterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do
not half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that
villa of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry
it broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''I gave them two years,' said Mr.'Lord Monmouth lived with his
first wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at
least nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,
for he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at
Lucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted
to bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being
his intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his
trustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and
then there never would have been a separation.''Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,
met, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy
Flouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby
was about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped
and would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,
but yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady
Wallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'
said Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it
seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every
one must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to
observe obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to
Lady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively
going to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such
rapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the
stairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady
Theresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord
Beaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given
him no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she
believed; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I
am to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it
cruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most
amiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that
Edith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady
Wallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point
to her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply
interesting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with
becoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of
exaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby
walked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady
Wallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end
of the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the
multitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,
and saw Edith on his arm.Lord
Beaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before
Buckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing
that no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was
impelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down
everybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:
he answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted
everybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by
historiettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a
joke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe
Miller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,
rattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was
extremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual
excesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so
cruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush
suffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly
and quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the
passion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the
ravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness
all the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since
he embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by
the waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her
side, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.'And now we are to each other as before?''And will be, come what come may.'CHAPTER I.


It was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing
on every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the
peasant's roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon
to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much
bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in
a basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of
broadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm
raiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and
dispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace
Lyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride
welcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of
the house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes
the season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful
eve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this
year to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,
too, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,
hearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of
Misrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had
been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
observances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas
had diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in
favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of
the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
inevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate
their condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork
question,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian
school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our
nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart
as well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to
elevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

provision train arrived on the morning of April 8th.The supplies were
being loaded into wagons and ambulances by a detail of about four thousand
men, many of them unarmed, when suddenly a body of Federal cavalry charged
upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"

"When are they going to operate?""He doesn't seem to blame you; he says it's all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer's
face showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney's shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"

"That would be cowardly, wouldn't it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn't
sulk; I think she's really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney's face.Life was terrible, after
all--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or
one was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or
like Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from
what they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and
laughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed
and wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed
to move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so
balanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There's only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld
is going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max
Wilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh
again.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them
off smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the
house."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy
started up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"

"Exactly.Unless--"

"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very
young men, and that isn't really love.""We'll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very
young.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at
the hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction
for women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don't you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven't time
to be in love.So warm did the argument become that
they passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather
heavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his
hand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,
looking ruefully after them.Ed's mind, only a vague and
inarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the
affection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing
of Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint
resentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had
taught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he
made his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o'clock that night, K. put down his pipe
and listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his
dressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his
first few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He
who had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close
touch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had
done.It had taken courage, God knew,
to give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more
courage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could
fight down this love for Sidney.The
innocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her
in his arms after her mother's death, the thousand small contacts of her
returns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter
days--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,
with Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by
Christine's fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and
watching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken
himself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when
the camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity
which would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking
out, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.'s
dresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it
lay under the pin-cushion.Two o'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the
picture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where
he could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and
looked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph
in his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them
impatiently out of his mind.Almost
before he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at
his door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,
a shawl about her shoulders."I've had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you'd
go with me.It seems as if I can't stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld's sobs had become low moans; Christine stood
helplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose
fault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine's
fingers.I guess you and I
understand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny
had been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked
strangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or
three internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a
Sidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide
and unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,
she did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to
admit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by
the door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after
all, in that condition--"

It was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he's dying; that I
murdered him."I came on duty at six o'clock and gave the
medicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all
right.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I
went to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn't give him
anything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at
the label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.'s eyes looked for a moment
directly into Carlotta's.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up
again.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had
seen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to
take her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room
at such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney's friend, that was all.It was the boy's weakened condition that was turning her
revenge into tragedy."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without
result.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could
have forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him
with knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed
could stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld's life.For, when
staff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward
with a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven's sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at
last, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now, with the tree shadows playing over
her.Now it was another and older man, daring,
intelligent, unscrupulous.And this time he had lost her absolutely,
lost her without a struggle to keep her.His only struggle had been with
himself, to remember that he had nothing to offer but failure."Do you know," said Sidney suddenly, "that it is almost a year since
that night you came up the Street, and I was here on the steps?""That's a fact, isn't it!"He managed to get some surprise into his
voice."Because--well, you know, K. Why do men always hate a woman who just
happens not to love them?"It would be much better for them if they
could.As a matter of fact, there are poor devils who go through life
trying to do that very thing, and failing."Sidney's eyes were on the tall house across.Ed's evening
office hour, and through the open window she could see a line of people
waiting their turn.They sat immobile, inert, doggedly patient, until
the opening of the back office door promoted them all one chair toward
the consulting-room."I shall be just across the Street," she said at last."Nearer than I am
at the hospital.""But we will still be friends, K.?"But, after another silence, he astounded her.She had fallen into the
way of thinking of him as always belonging to the house, even, in a
sense, belonging to her.And now--

"Shall you mind very much if I tell you that I am thinking of going
away?""My dear child, you do not need a roomer here any more.I have always
received infinitely more than I have paid for, even in the small
services I have been able to render.You are away, and some day you are going to be married.Don't you see--I
am not needed?""That does not mean you are not wanted."I'll always be near enough, so that I can see
you"--he changed this hastily--"so that we can still meet and talk
things over.Old friends ought to be like that, not too near, but to be
turned on when needed, like a tap.""The Rosenfelds are rather in straits.I thought of helping them to get
a small house somewhere and of taking a room with them.If they could furnish it even plainly, it could be
done."Have you always gone
through life helping people, K.?She bent over and put her hand on his shoulder."It will not be home without you, K."To save him, he could not have spoken just then.A riot of rebellion
surged up in him, that he must let this best thing in his life go out
of it.To go empty of heart through the rest of his days, while his very
arms ached to hold her!And she was so near--just above, with her hand
on his shoulder, her wistful face so close that, without moving, he
could have brushed her hair."You have not wished me happiness, K. Do you remember, when I was going
to the hospital and you gave me the little watch--do you remember what
you said?"You are going to leave us, and I--say it, K.""Good-bye, dear, and--God bless you."CHAPTER XXIII


The announcement of Sidney's engagement was not to be made for a year.Wilson, chafing under the delay, was obliged to admit to himself that
it was best.Carlotta would have
finished her training, and by that time would probably be reconciled to
the ending of their relationship.He had meant every word of what he had sworn to
Sidney.He was genuinely in love, even unselfishly--as far as he could
be unselfish.The secret was to be carefully kept also for Sidney's
sake.The hospital did not approve of engagements between nurses and the
staff.It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.Again,
weeks later, Wenceslas was certain, from inquiries made among the
students, that Jose's work in the classroom bordered a trifle too
closely on radicalism.And, still later,
happening to call at Jose's quarters just above his own in the
ecclesiastical dormitory, and not finding him in, he had been struck
by the absence of crucifix or other religious symbol in the room.Was
the young priest becoming careless of his example?And now, on this important feast-day, where was Padre Jose?On the
preceding evening, as Wenceslas leaned over the parapet of the wall
after his surprise by Jose, he had noted in the dim light the salient
features of a foreigner who, he had just learned, was registered at
the Hotel Mariano from the United States.Moreover, Wenceslas had just
come from Jose's room, whither he had gone in search of him, and--may
the Saints pardon his excess of holy zeal which impelled him to
examine the absent priest's effects!--he had returned now to the
Bishop bearing a copy of Renan's _Vie de Jesus_, with the American's
name on the flyleaf.It certainly were well to admonish Padre Jose
again, and severely!The Bishop, hardly to the surprise of his crafty coadjutor, flew into
a towering rage.He was a man of irascible temper, bitterly
intolerant, and unreasoningly violent against all unbelievers,
especially Americans whose affairs brought them to Colombia.In this
respect he was the epitome of the ecclesiastical anti-foreign
sentiment which obtained in that country.His intolerance of heretics
was such that he would gladly have bound his own kin to the stake had
he believed their opinions unorthodox.Yet he was thoroughly
conscientious, a devout churchman, and saturated with the beliefs of
papal infallibility and the divine origin of the Church.In the
observance of church rites and ceremonies he was unremitting.In the
soul-burning desire to witness the conversion of the world, and
especially to see the lost children of Europe either coaxed or beaten
back into the embrace of Holy Church, his zeal amounted to fanaticism.In the present case--

"Your Eminence," suggested the suave Wenceslas to his exasperated
superior, "may I propose that you defer action until I can discover
the exact status of this American?"And the Bishop forthwith placed the whole matter in his trusted
assistant's helpful hands.Meantime, Jose and the American explorer sat in the shade of a
magnificent palm on a high hill in beautiful Turbaco, looking out over
the shimmering sea beyond.For Hitt had wandered into the _Plaza de
Coches_ just as Jose was taking a carriage, and the latter could not
well refuse his proffered companionship for the day.Yet Jose feared
to be seen in broad daylight with this stranger, and he involuntarily
murmured a _Loado sea Dios_!when they reached Turbaco, as he
believed, unobserved.He did not know that a sharp-eyed young
novitiate, whom Wenceslas had detailed to keep the priest under
surveillance, had hurried back to his superior with the report of
Jose's departure with the _Americano_ on this innocent pleasure
jaunt."Say no more, my friend, in apology for your abrupt departure last
evening," the explorer urged."But tell me, rather, about your
illustrious grandfather who had his country seat in this delightful
spot.I've a notion to come here to live
some day."Jose cast his apprehensions upon the soft ocean breeze, and gave
himself up to the inspiriting influence of his charming environment.He dwelt at length upon the Rincon greatness of mediaeval days, and
expressed the resolve sometime to delve into the family records which
he knew must be hidden away in the moldering old city of Cartagena."But now," he concluded, after another reference to the Church, "is
Colombia to witness again the horror of those days of carnage?And
over the human mind's interpretation of the Christ?"There is but one
remedy--education.Not sectarian, partisan, worldly education--not
instruction in relative truths and the chaff of materialistic
speculation--but that sort of education whereby the selfish human mind
is lifted in a measure out of itself, out of its petty jealousies and
envyings, out of sneaking graft and touting for worldly emolument, and
into a sense of the eternal truth that real prosperity and soundness
of states and institutions are to be realized only when the
Christ-principle, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself,' is made the measure
of conduct.There is a tremendous truth which has long since been
demonstrated, and yet which the world is most woefully slow to grasp,
namely, that the surest, quickest means of realizing one's own
prosperity and happiness is in that of others--not in a world to come,
but right here and now.""But that means the inauguration of the millennium," protested Jose."Has not that
been the ultimate aim of Christianity, and of all serious effort for
reform for the past two thousand years?And, do you know, the
millennium could be ushered in to-morrow, if men only thought so?Within an incredibly short time evil, even to death itself, could be
completely wiped off the earth.But this wiping-off process must take
place in the minds and thoughts of men.Of that I am thoroughly
convinced.But, tell me, have you ever expressed to the Bishop your
views regarding the condition of this country?""Only a week ago I
tried again to convince him of the inevitable trend of events here
unless drastic measures were interposed by the Church.I had even
lectured on it in my classes.""The Bishop is a man of very narrow vision," replied Jose."He rebuked
me severely and truculantly bade me confine my attention to the
particular work assigned me and let affairs of politics alone.Of
course, that meant leaving them to his assistant, Wenceslas.Hitt,
Colombia needs a Luther!""Just so," returned the explorer gravely."Priestcraft from the very
earliest times has been one of the greatest curses of mankind.Its
abuses date far back to Egyptian times, when even prostitution was
countenanced by the priests, and when they practiced all sorts of
impostures upon the ignorant masses.In the Middle Ages they turned
Christianity, the richest of blessings, into a snare, a delusion, a
rank farce.They arrogated to themselves all learning, all science.In
Peru it was even illicit for any one not belonging to the nobility to
attempt to acquire learning.That was the sole privilege of priests
and kings.In all nations, from the remotest antiquity, and whether
civilized or not, learning has been claimed by the priests as the
unique privilege of their caste--a privilege bestowed upon them by the
special favor of the ruling deity.That's why they always sought to
surround their intellectual treasures with a veil of mystery.Roger
Bacon, the English monk, once said that it was necessary to keep the
discoveries of the philosophers from those unworthy of knowing them.How did he expect a realization of 'Thy kingdom come,' I wonder?""They didn't expect it to come--on earth," said Jose.They relegated that to the imagined realm which was to be entered
through the gateway of death.It's mighty convenient to be able to
relegate your proofs to that mysterious realm beyond the grave.That
has always been a tremendous power in the hands of priests of all
times and lands.By the way, did you know that the story of Abel's
assassination was one of many handed down, in one form or another, by
the priests of India and Egypt?"The story doubtless comes from the ancient Egyptian tale
which the priests of that time used to relate regarding the murder
of Osiris by his brother, Set.The story
later became incorporated into the sacred books of India and Egypt,
and was afterward taken over by the Hebrews, when they were captives
in Egypt.The Hebrews learned much of Egyptian theology, and their
own religion was greatly tinctured by it subsequently.The legend of
the deluge, for example, is another tradition of those primitive
days, and credited by the nations of antiquity.But here there is the
likelihood of a connection with the great cataclysm of antiquity,
the disappearance of the island of Atlantis in consequence of a
violent earthquake and volcanic action.This alleged island,
supposed to be a portion of the strip at one time connecting South
America with Africa, is thought to have sunk beneath the waters of
the present Atlantic ocean some nine thousand years before Solon
visited Egypt, and hence, some eleven thousand years ago.Anyway,
the story of this awful catastrophe got into the Egyptian records
in the earliest times, and was handed down to the Hebrews, who
probably based their story of the flood upon it.You see, there is a
foundation of some sort for all those legends in the book of Genesis.The difficulty has been that humanity has for centuries childishly
accepted them as historical fact.Now in very primitive times the serpent was the special emblem of
Kneph, the creator of the world, and was regarded as a sort of
good genius.It is still so regarded by the Chinese, who make of it
one of their most beautiful symbols, the dragon.Later it became the
emblem of Set, the slayer of Osiris; and after that it was looked
upon with horror as the enemy of mankind, the destroyer, the evil
principle.Hence, in Egypt, the Hebrew captives adopted the serpent
as emblematical of evil, and later used it in their scriptural
records as the evil genius that tempted Eve and brought about the
fall of man.And so all people whose religious beliefs are founded
upon the Hebrew Bible now look upon the serpent as the symbol of
evil.Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans thus regard it.""Well," he resumed, "the tree and the serpent were
worshiped all through eastern countries, from Scandinavia to the
Asiatic peninsula and down into Egypt.And, do you know, we even find
vestiges of such worship in America?Down in Adams county, Ohio, on
the banks of Brush creek, there is a great mound, called the serpent
mound.It is seven hundred feet long, and greatly resembles the one in
Glen Feechan, Argyleshire, Scotland.It also resembles the one I found
in the ancient city of Tiahuanuco, whose ruins lie at an elevation of
some thirteen thousand feet above the Pacific ocean, on the shores of
Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian frontier.This ancient city ages ago
sent out colonists all over North and South America.These primitive
people believed that a serpent emitted an egg from its mouth, and that
the earth was born of that egg.Now the serpent mound in Ohio has an
egg in its mouth.exclaimed Jose, his eyes wide with astonishment.Hitt laughed again in evident enjoyment of the priest's wonder.Then
he resumed: "It has been established to my entire satisfaction that
the ancient Egyptians and the Mayas of Central and South America used
almost identical symbols.And from all antiquity, and by all nations,
the symbols of the tree and serpent and their worship have been so
closely identified as to render it certain that their origin is the
same.What, then, are the serpent and tree of knowledge in the Hebrew
Bible but an outgrowth of this?The tree of life, of civilization, of
knowledge, was placed in the middle of the land, of the 'garden,' of
the primitive country of the race, Mayax.And the empire of the Mayas
was situated between the two great continents of North and South
America.They populated the
then existing island of Atlantis.And when the terrible earthquake
occurred, whereby this island was sunk beneath the waves of the
Atlantic ocean, why, to these people the world had been drowned!The
story got to Egypt, to Chaldea, and to India.Hence the deluge record
of Genesis.""But, these primitive people, how ancient are they?""No one can form any adequate estimate," said Hitt in reply."The
wonderful city of Tiahuanuco was in ruins when Manco Capac laid the
foundations of the Inca empire, which was later devastated by the
Spaniards.And the Indians told the Spaniards that it had been
constructed by giants before the sun shone in heaven.""Such facts as these--if facts they
be--relegate much of the Scriptural authority to the realm of legend
and myth!""When the human mind of this
century forces itself to approach a subject without prejudice or bias,
and without the desire to erect or maintain a purely human institution
at whatever cost to world-progress, then it finds that much of the
hampering, fettering dogma of mediaevalism now laid upon it by the
Church becomes pure fiction, without justifiable warrant or basis.Remember, the Hebrew people gave us the Old Testament, in which they
had recorded for ages their tribal and national history, their poetry,
their beliefs and hopes, as well as their legends, gathered from all
sources.We have likewise the historical records of other nations.But
the Hebrew possessed one characteristic which differentiated him from
all other people.He was a monotheist, and he saw his God in every
thing, every event, every place.His concept of God was his
life-motif.This concept evolved slowly, painfully, throughout the
centuries.The ancient Hebrew patriarchs saw it as a variable God,
changeful, fickle, now violently angry, now humbly repentant, now
making contracts with mankind, now petulantly destroying His own
handiwork.He was a God who could order the slaughter of innocent
babes, as in the book of Samuel; or He was a tender, merciful Father,
as in the Psalms.He could harden hearts, wage bloody wars, walk with
men 'in the cool of the day,' create a universe with His fist, or
spend long days designing and devising the material utensils and
furniture of sacrifice to be used in His own worship.In short, men
saw in Him just what they saw in themselves.The Bible records humanity's changing, evolving concept of
God, of that'something not ourselves which makes for righteousness.'And this concept gradually changed from the magnified God-man of the
Old Testament, a creature of human whims and passions, down to that
held by the man of Nazareth, a new and beautiful concept of God as
love.This new concept Jesus joyously gave to a sin-weary world that
had utterly missed the mark.But it cost him his earthly life to do
it.And the dark record of the so-called Christian Church, both
Protestant and Catholic, contains the name of many a one who has paid
the same penalty for a similar service of love."The Chaldeans and Egyptians," he went on, after a moment's reflective
pause, "gave the Hebrews their account of the creation of the
universe, the fall of man, the flood, and many other bits of mythical
lore.And into these stories the Hebrews read the activity of their
God, and drew from them deep moral lessons.Egypt gave the Hebrews at
least a part of the story of Joseph, as embodied in the hieroglyphics
which may be read on the banks of the Nile to-day.They probably also
gave the Hebrews the account of the creation found in the second
chapter of Genesis, for to this day you can see in some of the oldest
Egyptian temples pictures of the gods making men out of lumps of clay.The discovery of the remains of the 'Neanderthal man' and the 'Ape-man
of Java' now places the dawn of human reason at a period some three to
five hundred thousand years prior to our present century, and,
combined with the development of the science of geology, which shows
that the total age of the earth's stratified rocks alone cannot be
much less than fifty-five millions of years, serves to cast additional
ridicule upon the Church's present attitude of stubborn adherence to
these prehistoric scriptural legends as literal, God-given fact.But,
to make the right use of these legends--well, that is another thing.""I find it difficult to explain," he said at
length."But, remember what I have already said, there is, there
_must_ be, a foundation beneath all these legends which admonish
mankind to turn from evil to good.And, as I also said, that
foundation must be very broad.I have said that I was in search of a
religion.Why not, you may ask, accept the religious standard which
Jesus set?That was the new concept of God as love.I am
quite convinced that love is _the_ religion, _the_ tie which binds all
things together and to a common source and cause.And I am equally
convinced that Jesus is the only person recorded in history who ever
lived a life of pure reflection of the love which he called God.And
so you see why I am chipping and hewing away at the theological
conception of the Christ, and trying to get at the reality buried deep
beneath in the theological misconceptions of the centuries.I am quite
convinced that if men loved one another, as Jesus bade them do, all
war, strife, disease, poverty, and discord of every sort would vanish
from human experience.But--and here is a serious question--did Jesus
ask the impossible?Did he command us to love the sinful, erring
mortal whom we see in our daily walk--or did he--did he have a new
thought, namely, that by loving the real man, for which, perhaps, this
human concept stands in the human mind, _that this very act would
change that distorted concept and cause it to yield its place to the
real one_?I believe Jesus to have been the wisest man who ever trod
this earth.But I likewise believe that no man has ever been more
deplorably misunderstood, misquoted, and misinterpreted than he.And
so I am delving down, down beneath the mass of human conjecture and
ridiculous hypothesis which the Church Fathers and our own theologians
have heaped up over this unique character, if perchance I may some day
discover just what he was, just what he really said, and just what the
message which he sought to convey to mankind."He leaned over and laid a hand on Jose's arm."My young friend," he
said earnestly, "I believe there are meanings in the life and words of
Jesus of which the Church in its astounding self-sufficiency has never
even dreamed.Did he feed the multitude with
a few loaves?Did he himself issue from the
tomb?No more momentous questions were ever asked than these.For, if
so, _then the message of Jesus has a bearing on the material universe,
on the human mind, and the whole realm of thought that is utterly
revolutionary_!Did the man's own apostles and
immediate followers understand it?Certain we are, however,
that the theology which Rome gave to her barbarian conquerors was
wholly different from that taught by Jesus and his disciples.And we
know that the history of Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire down
to the Franco-Prussian war is largely a recital of the development of
the religious beliefs which Rome handed down to her conquerors, and
their influence upon the human mind.These beliefs constitute the
working hypothesis of that institution known to-day as the Holy Roman
Catholic Church, and its separated offshoots, the Greek Catholic and
the Protestant Churches, including the numberless ramifications and
divisions of the latter.The question as to whether eternal salvation
is a function of complete immersion of the human body, or only a
gentle sprinkling, appears most lamentably puerile in the face of the
tremendous revolutionary truths hinted by the deeds of Jesus, assuming
that he has been correctly reported in the Gospels.No; Renan, in his
_Vie de Jesus_, which I gave you last night, missed it.Before him,
Voltaire and countless other critics of man-made theology missed it.The writings of these men do serve, however, to mow down the
theological stubble in the world's field of thought.What is it, this
gigantic truth which Jesus brought?But he himself is
reported to have said, 'If ye keep my commands, ye shall know of the
doctrine.'And his chief command was, _that we love God and our
fellow-men_.I have no doubt whatever that, when we follow this
command, we shall know of the doctrine which he came to establish in
the hearts of men.""But his message was the brotherhood of man," said Jose."Nay," replied the explorer, "it was the _fatherhood_ of God,
rather.But, while we agree
thus far, who can say what the fatherhood of God implies?Who,
realizing that this was Jesus' message, knows how to make it
practical, as he did?To him it meant--ah, what did it not mean!It
meant a consciousness that held _not one trace of evil_.It meant a
consciousness of God as omnipotent power, the irresistible power
of good, which, in the form of spirit, or mind, as some will have it,
is ever present.Well, then, who is there to-day,
within the Church or without, who understands the divine message of
the fatherhood of God sufficiently to acquire such a consciousness,
and to make the intensely practical application of the message to
every problem of mind, or body, or environment?Who to-day in your
Church or mine, for example, realizes that Jesus must have seen
something in matter far different from the solid, indestructible thing
that we think we see, and that this was due to his understanding of
the immanence of his Father as spirit--an understanding which enabled
him to walk on the waves, and to treat material things as if they
were not?No, my friend, the Christ-message of the fatherhood of God
is hardly apprehended in the world to-day in the slightest degree by
priest or prelate, church or sect.And yet, the influence of Jesus is
tremendous!""I--I don't believe I follow you,
quite," he said."I am not surprised," replied the explorer gently."I sometimes wonder
if I understand myself just what it is that I am trying to express.My
belief is still in a state of transition.And now--now I am waiting for the new seed.I
have abandoned forever the sterile, non-productive religious beliefs
of current theology.I have abandoned such belittling views of God as
the Presbyterian sublapsarian view of election.I have turned wearily
from the puerile dogma of your Church as unworthy of the Father of
Jesus.From delving into the mysteries of the Brahminism of India, of
ancestor-worship in Japan, of Confucianism in China, of Islamism in
the far East, I have come back to the wonderful man of Nazareth.And
now I am trying to see what Christianity would be if purged of its
adulterations--purged of the Greek philosophy of the early Fathers; of
the forgeries of the Middle Ages; of the pagan ceremonialism and
priestly rites and assumptions of power to save or damn in this
present century.And what do I find, after all this rubbish has been
filtered out?Love, friend--love; the unfathomable love of the Father
of Jesus, who knows no evil, no sin, no sickness, no death, no hell,
no material heaven, but whose kingdom is the harmonious realm of
spirit, or mind, wherein the individual consciousness knows no discord
of any name or nature."The afternoon haze had been long gathering when Jose roused the sleeping
_cochero_ and prepared to return to the stifling ecclesiastical
atmosphere from which for a brief day he had been so happily free.A
cold chill swept over him when he took his seat in the carriage, and
he shuddered as if with an evil presentiment."And you still adhere to your determination to remain in the Church?"his friend asked, as they turned from the green hills and nodding
palms of Turbaco, and set their course, toward the distant mediaeval
city.But as Jose spoke, he knew
that his mind had that day been stripped of its last remaining vestige
of the old theology, leaving it bare, exposed--and receptive.*       *       *       *       *

A week passed.The explorer had gone, as silently and unannounced as
he had come.The evening before his departure he and Jose had sat
again in the thick shadows of the old wall.The next morning he was on
the mighty river; and the priest was left with a great void in his
heart.One noon, as Jose was returning from his classes, he pondered deeply
the last words of the explorer, "Remember, nothing that has been
invented by mankind or evolved by the human mind can stand, or remain.We might just as well accept that great fact now as later, and adjust
ourselves to it.And Paul has
told us what they are."As he passed slowly along the winding little street toward the
dormitory, a messenger approached him with a summons from the Bishop.He turned and started wonderingly toward the Cathedral.He had been
reprimanded once, twice, for the liberal views which he had expressed
to his classes.He had tried to
be more careful of late.An hour later, his eyes set and unseeing, and his thin lips trembling,
Jose dragged himself up the stone steps to his little room and threw
himself upon the bed.The bonds which had been slowly, imperceptibly
tightening during these few months of precious liberty had been drawn
suddenly taut.The Bishop, in the _role_ of _Inquisitor Natus_, had
just revealed a full knowledge of his dismal past, and had summarily
dismissed him from the University faculty.Jose, bewildered and
stunned, had tried vainly to defend himself.Then, realizing his
impotence before the uncompromising bigotry of this choleric
ecclesiastic, he had burst suddenly into a torrent of frenzied
declarations of his undeserved wrongs, of his resolve now to renounce
his oath, to leave the Church, to abandon honor, family, everything
that held or claimed him, and to flee into unknown and unknowing
parts, where his harassed soul might find a few years of rest before
its final flight!The Bishop became bitterly and implacably
infuriated, and remanded the excited priest to his room to reflect
upon his wild words, and to await the final disposition of his
case--unless he should have determined already to try the devious
route of apostasy.Rising the next morning at dawn from the chill floor where he had
spent the torturing hours of an interminable night, and still clinging
forlornly to his battered sense of honor and family pride, Jose again
received the Bishop's summons; and, after the events of the morning
already related, faced the angry churchman's furious tirade, and with
it, what he could not have imagined before, a charge of hideous
immorality.Then had been set before him a choice between apostasy and
acceptance of the assignment to the parish of far-off Simiti."And now, unpitying Fate," he murmured, as the door of the Bishop's
_sanctum_ closed behind him, and he wandered down through the gloom of
the quiet Cathedral, "receive your victim.You have chosen well your
carnal instruments--pride--ecclesiasticism--lust!Aye, the
very lowest; for I have loved liberty of thought and conscience; I
have loved virtue and honor; the pursuits of intellect; the fair; the
noble; yea, the better things of life.I have loved my fellow-men; and
I have sought their emancipation from the thraldom of ignorance.I
have loved truth, and the Christ who revealed it to the dull minds of
mortals.And--I accept the sentence--I have
no desire to resist it.CHAPTER 16


The tropical moon shone in her fullness from an unclouded sky.Through
the ethereal atmosphere which bathed the storied city her beams fell,
plashing noiselessly upon the grim memorials of a stirring past.With
a mantle of peace they gently covered the former scenes of violence
and strife.With magic, intangible substance they filled out the rents
in the grassy walls and smoothed away the scars of battle.The pale
luster, streaming through narrow barbican and mildewed arch, touched
the decaying ruin of San Felipe with the wand of enchantment, and
restored it to pristine freshness and strength.Through the stillness
of night the watery vapor streamed upward from garden and _patio_, and
mingled with the scent of flushing roses and tropical buds in a
fragrant mist suffused with the moon's yellow glow.On the low parapet bordering the eastern esplanade of the city wall
the solitary figure of the priest cast a narrow shadow in the pale
moonlight.The sounds which eddied the enveloping silence seemed to
echo in his ears the tread of mediaeval warriors.In the wraith-like
shadows he saw the armored forms of _Conquistadores_ in mortal strife
with vulpine buccaneers.In the whirring of the bats which flouted his
face he heard the singing of arrows and the hiss of hurled rocks.In
the moan of the ocean as it broke on the coral reef below sounded the
boom of cannon, the curses of combatants, and the groans of the dying.Here and there moved tonsured monks, now absolving in the name of the
peaceful Christ the frenzied defenders of the Heroic City, now turning
to hurl curses at the swarming enemy and consign their blackened souls
to deepest hell, while holding images of the crucified Saviour to the
quivering lips of stricken warriors.In the fancied combat raging in the moonlight before him he saw the
sons of the house of Rincon manifesting their devotion to Sovereign
and Pope, their unshaken faith in Holy Church, their hot zeal which
made them her valiant defenders, her support, her humble and devoted
slaves for more than three centuries.What was the charm by which she had held them?And why had its potency
failed utterly when directed to him?But they were men of physical
action, not thought--men of deeds which called only for brave hearts
and stout bodies.It is true, there had been thinkers in those days,
when the valiant sons of Rincon hurled the enemy from Cartagena's
walls--but they lay rotting in dungeons--they lay broken on the rack,
or hung breathing out their souls to God amid the hot flames which His
self-appointed vicars kindled about them.The Rincons of that day had
not been thinkers.But the centuries had finally evolved from their
number a man of thought.the evolution had developed intellect,
it is true--but the process had refined away the rugged qualities of
animal strength which, without a deeper hold on Truth and the way to
demonstrate it than Jose possessed, must leave him the plaything of
Fate.Young in years, but old in sorrow; held by oaths which his ever-accusing
sense of honor would not let him break; trembling for his mother's
sake, and for the sake of Rincon pride, lest the ban of excommunication
fall upon him; yet little dreaming that Rome had no thought of this
while his own peculiar elements of character bound him as they did
to her; the man had at last yielded his life to the system which had
wrecked it in the name of Christ, and was now awaiting the morrow, when
the boat should bear him to far-off Simiti.He went resignedly--even
with a dull sense of gladness--for he went to die.Life had yielded
him nothing--and constituted as he was, it could hold nothing for him
in the future.The glorious moon poured its full splendor upon the quiet city.Through the haze the convent on La Popa sparkled like an enchanted
castle, with a pavement of soft moonbeams leading up to its doors.The
trill of a distant nightingale rippled the scented air; and from the
_llanos_ were borne on the warm land breeze low feral sounds, broken
now and then by the plaintive piping of a lonely toucan.The cocoa
palms throughout the city stirred dreamily in the tempered moonlight;
and the banana trees, bending with their luscious burden, cast great,
mysterious shadows, wherein insect life rustled and scampered in
nocturnal activity.Yes--ah, why did he let his own misery blind him to the sorrow
of others even more unfortunate!Descending the broad incline to the road below, Jose hurried
with the woman to the bedside of the dying girl.On the way the
warm-hearted, garrulous Catalina relieved her troubled and angered
soul.He would not shrive her unless we
would pay him first.He said he would do it for ten _pesos_--then
five--and then three.And when we kept telling him that we had no
money he told us to go out and borrow it, or he would leave the little
Maria to die as she was.He said she was a vile sinner anyway--that
she had not made her Easter duty--that she could not have the
Sacrament--and her soul would go straight to hell--and there was no
redemption!Then he came again this afternoon and said she must die;
but he would shrive her for two _pesos_.And when we told him we could
not borrow the money he was terribly angry, and cursed--and Marcelena
was frightened--and the little Maria almost died.But I told him to
go--that her little soul was whiter than his--and if he went to heaven
I didn't want Maria to go there too--and--!"The woman's words burned through the priest's ears and into his
sickened soul.Recovering her breath, Catalina went on:

"It is only a few days ago that the little Maria meets Sister Isabel
in the _plaza_.'Ah,' says Sister Isabel, 'you are going to be a
mother.'"'Yes, Sister,' answers the little Maria, much confused; and she tries
to hide behind Marcelena."'It is very dangerous and you will suffer much unless you have a
sacred cord of Saint Frances,' says the Sister."And then she asks where the little Maria lives; and that very day she
brings a piece of rope, with knots in it, which she says the priest
has blessed, and it is a sacred cord of Saint Frances, and if the
little Maria will wear it around her waist she will not suffer at the
parturition; and the little Maria must pay a _peso oro_ for it--and
the scared little lamb paid it, for she had saved a little money which
Don Carlos Ojeda gave her for washing--and she wore it when the babe
was born; but it didn't help her--"

"_Dios!_" ejaculated the priest."And Marcelena had paid a _peso y medio_," continued the excited
woman, "for a candle that Sister Natalia told her had come from the
altar of the Virgin of Santander and was very holy and would help one
through confinement.But the candle went out; and it was only a round
stick of wood with a little piece of candle on the end.And I--Padre,
I could not help it, I would do anything for the poor child--I paid
two _pesos oro_ for a new _escapulario_ for her.Sister Natalia said
it was very holy--it had been blessed by His Grace, the Bishop, just
for women who were to be mothers, and it would carry them through--but
if they died, it would take them right out of purgatory--and--!""But, Padre, the babe," the woman persisted.And--do you know?--Padre Lorenzo says _it is yours!_ He told Juanita
so--she lives below us.She has told only
Marcelena--and Marcelena will never tell.The priest, recognizing the inevitable, patiently resigned himself to
the woman's talk without further reply.Presently they turned into the
Calle Lazano, and entering the house where Marcelena had greeted him
that morning, mounted to the chamber above where lay the little
Maria.A single candle on a table near the head of the bed shed a flickering,
uncertain light.But the window was open, and the moon's beams poured
into the room in golden profusion.Aside from the girl, there were no
other occupants than Marcelena and the new-born child."Padre," murmured the passing girl, "you will not let me die without
the Sacrament?""No, child," replied the priest, bending over her, hot tears streaming
down his cheeks as she kissed his hand.The girl had been beautiful, a type of that soft, southern beauty,
whose graces of form, full, regular features, and rich olive tint mark
them as truly Spanish, with but little admixture of inferior blood.Her features were drawn and set now; but her great, brown eyes which
she raised to the priest were luminous with a wistful eagerness that
in this final hour became sacred."Marcelena," the priest hurriedly whispered to the woman."I have
no--but it matters not now; she need not know that I come unprepared.She must pass out of the world happy at last.""There is a drop of wine that the doctor left; and I will fetch a bit
of bread," replied the woman, catching the meaning of the priest's
words."Bring it; and I will let her confess now."Bending over the sinking girl, the priest bade her reveal the burden
resting on her conscience."_Carita_," he said tenderly, when the confession was ended, "fear
not.He went to prepare a place for
you and for us all.He forgave the sinful woman--_carita_, he forgives
you--yes, freely, gladly.Forget all now but the good
Saviour, who stands with open arms--with a smile on his beautiful
face--to welcome his dear child--his little girl--you, _carita_,
you.""Yes, child, it shall be cared for.""But not by the Sisters"--excitedly--"not in an asylum--Padre, promise
me!""There, _carita_, it shall be as you wish.""I, child?--ah, yes, I will care for it."The girl sank back again with a smile of happiness.At the feet of the priest Catalina huddled and
wept softly.Marcelena, in the shadow of the bed where she might not
be seen, rocked silently back and forth with breaking heart."Padre--you will--say Masses for me?""I--have no money--no money.He promised to give me--money--and
clothes--"

"There, _carita_, I will say Masses for you without money--every day,
for a year.And you shall have clothes--ah, carita, in heaven you
shall have everything."The moon flooded the room with
ethereal radiance."Padre--lift me up--it grows dark--oh, Padre, you are so good to
me--so good.""No, child, it is not I who am good to you, but the blessed Christ.See him, _carita_--there--there in the moonlight he stands!"The smoke from a neighboring chimney drifted slowly past the window
and shone white in the silvery beams.The girl, supported by the arm
of the priest, gazed at it through dimming eyes in reverent awe."Padre," she whispered, "it is the Saviour!And turning toward the window the priest extended his
hand."Blessed Saviour," he prayed, "this is one of thy stricken lambs,
lured by the wolf from the fold.The sobs of the weeping woman at his feet floated through the room."Ah, thou tender and pitying Master--best friend of the sinning, the
sick, and the sorrowing--we offer to thee this bruised child.We find
no sin, no guile, in her; for after the ignorant code of men she has
paid the last farthing for satisfying the wolf's greed.In the presence of death he felt his own terrible impotence.Of what
avail then was his Christianity?Or the Church's traditional words of
comfort?But something within--perhaps
that "something not ourselves"--the voice of Israel's almost forgotten
God--whispered a hope that blossomed in this petition of tenderest
love and pity.He had long since ceased to pray for himself; but in
this, the only prayer that had welled from his chilled heart in
months, his pitying desire to humor the wishes of a dying girl had
unconsciously formulated his own soul's appeal."Blessed Saviour, take her to thine arms; shield her forever more
from the carnal lust of the wolf; lift her above the deadening
superstitions and hypocritical creeds of those who touch but to
stain; take her, Saviour, for we find her pure, innocent, clean;
suffering and sorrow have purged away the sin.The scent of roses and orange blossoms from the garden below drifted
into the room on the warm breeze.A bird, awakened by the swaying of
its nest, peeped a few sweet notes of contentment, and slept again."We would save her--we would cure her--but we, too, have strayed from
thee and forgotten thy commands--and the precious gift of healing
which thou didst leave with men has long been lost.But thou art
here--thy compassionate touch still heals and saves.Jesus, unique son
of God, behold thy child."He says come, _carita_--come!"With a fluttering sigh the tired child sank back into the priest's
arms and dropped softly into her long sleep.CHAPTER 17


The twisted, turbid "Danube of New Granada," under the gentle guidance
of its patron, Saint Mary Magdalene, threads the greater part of its
sinuous way through the heart of Colombia like an immense, slow-moving
morass.Born of the arduous tropic sun and chill snows, and imbued by
the river god with the nomadic instinct, it leaps from its pinnacled
cradle and rushes, sparkling with youthful vigor, down precipice and
perpendicular cliff; down rocky steeps and jagged ridges; whirling in
merry, momentary dance in shaded basins; singing in swirling eddies;
roaring in boisterous cataracts, to its mad plunge over the lofty wall
of Tequendama, whence it subsides into the dignity of broad maturity,
and begins its long, wandering, adult life, which slowly draws to a
sluggish old age and final oblivion in the infinite sea.Toward the
close of its meandering course, long after the follies and excesses of
early life, it takes unto itself a consort, the beautiful Cauca; and
together they flow, broadening and deepening as life nears its end;
merging their destinies; sharing their burdens; until at last, with
labors ended, they sink their identities in the sunlit Caribbean.When the simple-minded _Conquistadores_ first pushed their frail
cockleshells out into the gigantic embouchure of this tawny stream and
looked vainly for the opposite shore, veiled by the dewy mists of a
glittering morn, they unconsciously crossed themselves and, forgetful
for the moment of greed and rapine and the lust of gold, stood in
reverent awe before the handiwork of their Creator.Ere the Spaniard
had laid his fell curse upon this ancient kingdom of the Chibchas, the
flowering banks of the Magdalena, to-day so mournfully characterized
by their frightful solitudes, were an almost unbroken village from the
present coast city of Barranquilla to Honda, the limit of navigation,
some nine hundred miles to the south.The cupidity of the heartless,
bigoted rabble from mediaeval slums which poured into this wonderland
late in the sixteenth century laid waste this luxuriant vale and
exterminated its trustful inhabitants.Now the warm airs that sigh at
night along the great river's uncultivated borders seem still to echo
the gentle laments of the once happy dwellers in this primitive
paradise.Sitting in the rounded bow of the wretched riverine steamer Honda,
Padre Jose de Rincon gazed with vacant eyes upon the scenery on either
hand.The boat had arrived from Barranquilla that morning, and was now
experiencing the usual exasperating delay in embarking from Calamar.He had just returned to it, after wandering for hours through the
forlorn little town, tormented physically by the myriad mosquitoes,
and mentally by a surprising eagerness to reach his destination.He
could account for the latter only on the ground of complete
resignation--a feeling experienced by those unfortunate souls who have
lost their way in life, and, after vain resistance to molding
circumstances, after the thwarting of ambitions, the quenching of
ideals, admit defeat, and await, with something of feverish
anticipation, the end.He had left Cartagena early that morning on the
ramshackle little train which, after hours of jolting over an
undulating roadbed, set him down in Calamar, exhausted with the heat
and dust-begrimed.He had not seen the Bishop nor Wenceslas since the
interview of the preceding day.Before his departure, however, he had
made provision for the burial of the girl, Maria, and the disposal of
her child.This he did at his own expense; and when the demands of
doctor and sexton had been met, and he had provided Marcelena with
funds for the care of herself and the child for at least a few weeks,
his purse was pitiably light.Late in the afternoon the straggling remnant of a sea breeze drifted
up the river and tempered the scorching heat.Then the captain of the
Honda drained his last glass of red rum in the _posada_, reiterated to
his political affiliates with spiritous bombast his condensed opinion
anent the Government, and dramatically signaled the pilot to get under
way.Beyond the fact that Simiti lay somewhere behind the liana-veiled
banks of the great river, perhaps three hundred miles from Cartagena,
the priest knew nothing of his destination.There were no passengers
bound for the place, the captain had told him; nor had the captain
himself ever been there, although he knew that one must leave the boat
at a point called Badillo, and thence go by canoe to the town in
question.But Jose's interest in Simiti was only such as one might manifest in a
prison to which he was being conveyed.And, as a prisoner of the
Church, he inwardly prayed that his remaining days might be few.The
blows which had fallen, one after another, upon his keen, raw nerves
had left him benumbed.The cruel bruises which his faith in man had
received in Rome and Cartagena had left him listless, and without
pain.He was accepting the Bishop's final judgment mutely, for he had
already borne all that human nature could endure.His severance from a
life of faith and love was complete.Nor could Jose learn when he might hope to reach Badillo, though he
made listless inquiry."_Na, Senor Padre_," the captain had said, "we never know where to
find the water.It is on the right to-day; on the left to-morrow.There is low tide to-night; the morning may see it ten feet higher.And Badillo--_quien sabe_?And he shrugged his shoulders in complete disclaimer of any
responsibility therefor.The captain's words were not idle, for the channel of the mighty river
changes with the caprice of a maiden's heart.With irresistible
momentum the tawny flood rolls over the continent, now impatiently
ploughing its way across a great bend, destroying plantations and
abruptly leaving towns and villages many miles inland; now savagely
filching away the soft loam banks beneath little settlements and
greedily adding broad acres to the burden of its surcharged waters.Mighty giants of the forest, wrested from their footholds of
centuries, plunge with terrifying noise into the relentless stream;
great masses of earth, still cohering, break from their moorings and
glide into the whirling waters, where, like immense islands, they
journey bobbing and tumbling toward the distant sea.Against the strong current, whose quartzose sediment tinkled
metallically about her iron prow, the clumsy Honda made slow headway.She was a craft of some two hundred tons burden, with iron hull,
stern paddle wheel, and corrugated metal passenger deck and roof.Below the passenger deck, and well forward on the hull, stood the
huge, wood-burning boiler, whose incandescent stack pierced the open
space where the gasping travelers were forced to congregate to get
what air they might.Midway on this deck she carried a few cabins at
either side.These, bare of furnishings, might accommodate a dozen
passengers, if the insufferable heat would permit them to be
occupied.Each traveler was obliged to supply his own bedding, and
likewise hammock, unless not too discriminating to use the soiled
cot provided.Many of those whose affairs necessitated river
travel--and there was no other mode of reaching the interior--were
content at night to wrap a light blanket about them and lie down
under their mosquito nets on the straw mats--_petates_--with which
every _peon_ goes provided.Of service, there was none that might be
so designated.A few dirty, half-dressed <DW64> boys from the streets
of Barranquilla performed the functions of steward, waiting on table
with unwashed hands, helping to sling hammocks, or assisting with the
carving of the freshly killed beef on the slippery deck below.Accustomed as he had been to the comforts of Rome, and to the less
elaborate though still adequate accommodations which Cartagena
afforded, Jose viewed his prison boat with sinking heart.Iron hull,
and above it the glowing boiler; over this the metal passenger deck;
and above that the iron roof, upon which the fierce tropical sun
poured its flaming heat all day; clouds of steam and vapor from
the hot river enveloping the boat--had the Holy Inquisition itself
sought to devise the most refined torture for a man of delicate
sensibilities like Jose de Rincon, it could not have done better than
send him up the great river at this season and on that miserable
craft, in company with his own morbid and soul-corroding thoughts.The day wore on; and late in the evening the Honda docked at the
pretentious town of Maganguey, the point of transfer for the river
Cauca.Like the other passengers, from whom he had held himself
reservedly aloof, Jose gladly seized the opportunity to divert his
thoughts for a few moments by going ashore.But the moments stretched
into hours; and when he finally learned that the boat would not leave
until daybreak, he lapsed into a state of sullen desperation which,
but for the Rincon stubbornness, would have precipitated him into the
dark stream.Aimlessly he wandered about the town, avoiding any
possible _rencontre_ with priests, or with his fellow-passengers, many
of whom, together with the bacchanalian captain, he saw in the various
_cantinas_, making merry over rum and the native _anisado_.The moon rose late, bathing the whitewashed town in a soft sheen and
covering with its yellow veil the filth and squalor which met the
priest at every turn as he wandered through its ill-lighted streets.Maganguey in plan did not depart from the time-honored custom of the
Spaniards, who erected their cities by first locating the church, and
then building the town around it.So long as the church had a good
location, the rest of the town might shift for itself.Some of the
better buildings dated from the old colonial period, and had tile
roofs and red brick floors.Many bore scars received in the
internecine warfare which has raged in the unhappy country with but
brief intervals of peace since the days of Spanish occupation.But
most of the houses were of the typical mud-plastered, palm-thatched
variety, with dirt floors and scant furniture.Yet even in many of
these Jose noted pianos and sewing machines, generally of German make,
at which the housewife was occupied, while naked babes and squealing
pigs--the latter of scarcely less value than the former--fought for
places of preferment on the damp and grimy floors.Wandering, blindly absorbed in thought, into a deserted road which
branched off from one of the narrow streets on the outskirts of the
town, Jose stumbled upon a figure crouching in the moonlight.Almost
before he realized that it was a human being a hand had reached up and
caught his."_Buen Padre!_" came a thick voice from the mass, "for the love of the
good Virgin, a few _pesos_!"Ah, well; Jose's purse was light--and his
life of no value.So, recovering from his start, he sought in his
pockets for some _billetes_.But--yes, he remembered that after
purchasing his river transportation in Calamar he had carefully put
his few remaining bills in his trunk."_Amigo_, I am sorry, but I have no money with me," he said
regretfully."But if you will come to the boat I will gladly give you
something there."At this the figure emitted a scream of rage, and broke into a torrent
of sulphurous oaths."_Na_, the Saints curse you beggarly priests!You
have no money, but you rob us poor devils with your lies, and then
leave us to rot to death!""But, _amigo_, did I not say--" began Jose soothingly."_Maldito!_" shrilled the figure; "may Joseph and Mary and Jesus curse
you!A million curses on you, _maldito_!"Pulling itself upward, the
shapeless thing sank its teeth deep into the priest's hand.With a cry of pain the startled Jose tore himself loose, his hand
dripping with blood.At the same time the figure fell over into the
road and its enveloping rags slipped off, disclosing in the bright
moonlight a loathsome, distorted face and elephantine limbs, covered
with festering sores.Turning swiftly from the hideous object, his brain awhirl with the
horrible nightmare, the priest fled blindly from the scene.Nauseated,
quivering with horror, with the obscene ravings of the leper still
ringing in his ears, he stumbled about the town until daybreak, when
the boat's shrieking whistle summoned him to embark.The second day on the river seemed to Jose intolerable, as he shifted
about the creaking, straining tub to avoid the sun's piercing rays and
the heat which, drifting back from the hot stack forward, enveloped
the entire craft.There were but few passengers, some half dozen men
and two slatternly attired women.Whither they were bound, he knew
not, nor cared; and, though they saluted him courteously, he
studiously avoided being drawn into their conversations.The emotional
appeal of the great river and its forest-lined banks did not at first
affect him.Yet he sought forgetfulness of self by concentrating his
thought upon them.The massed foliage constituted an impenetrable wall on either side.Everywhere his eyes met a maze of _lianas_, creeping plants, begonias,
and bizarre vegetable forms, shapes and hues of which he had never
before had any adequate conception.Often he caught the glint of
great, rare butterflies hovering in the early sunlight which filtered
through the interlaced fronds and branches.Often when the boat hugged
the bank he saw indescribable buds and blossoms, and multicolored
orchids clinging to the drooping _bejucos_ which festooned the
enormous trees.As the afternoon waned and the sun hung low, the magic
stillness of the solitude began to cast its spell about him, and he
could imagine that he was penetrating a fairy-land.The vast stream,
winding, broadening, ramifying round wooded islets, throwing out long,
dusky lagoons and swampy arms, incessantly plying its numberless
activities, at length held him enraptured.As he brooded over it all,
his thought wandered back to the exploits of the intrepid Quesada and
his stalwart band who, centuries before, had forced their perilous way
along this same river, amid showers of poisoned arrows from hostile
natives, amid the assaults of tropical storms and malarial fevers, to
the plateau of Cundinamarca, the home of the primitive Muiscas; and
there gathering fresh strength and inspiration, had pushed on to the
site of Santa Fe de Bogota.The clang of the pilot's bell stopped the clumsy craft; but not before
the ragged little <DW64> boy who had served at Jose's table as steward
had been swept far away by the rapid current.Every one of the rabble
rout of stokers, stewards, and stevedores lost his wits and set up a
frenzied yell.Some who remembered that there was such a thing, tore
at the ropes which held the single lifeboat.But the boat had been put
on for appearance's sake, not for service, and successfully resisted
all efforts at removal.No one dared risk his life in attempted
rescue, for the river swarmed with crocodiles.There was vain racing,
counseling and gesticulating; but at length, the first wave of
excitement over, passengers and crew settled down to watch the outcome
of the boy's struggle for life, while the pilot endeavored to turn the
unwieldy steamer about."Now is the time to put up a prayer for the youngster, Padre," said a
voice behind Jose.Jose
had noticed him on the boat when he embarked at Calamar, and surmised
that he had probably come up from Barranquilla."An excellent opportunity to try the merits of a prayer to the Virgin,
no?If she can fish us out of purgatory she ought to pull this boy out
of the river, eh?""I would rather trust to a canoe and a pair of stout arms than a
prayer at present," returned Jose with candor."_Corriente!_" replied the man; "my way of thinking, exactly!But if I
had a good rifle now I'd put that little fellow out of his misery, for
he's going down, sure!"It was not unkindly said; and Jose appreciated the man's rude
sentiment."_Hombre!_" cried the man.The rapid, swirling current
continually frustrated his efforts to reach the shore."_Dios!_" Jose exclaimed.Yet here his earthly representative,
trained in all the learning and culture of Holy Church to be an _Alter
Christus_, stood helplessly by and watched a child drown!How impotent the
beliefs of men in such an hour!Could the Holy Father himself, with
all his assumptions, spiritual and temporal--with all his power to
loose from sin and from the imaginary torments of purgatory--save this
drowning boy?As he did so a murmur of awe
arose from the spectators.Impelled from below, the body of the boy was hurled out of the water."_Cayman!_" gasped the horrified crew.Jose stood spellbound, as the ghastly truth dawned upon him.A
crocodile, gliding beneath the struggling lad, had tossed him upward,
and caught him in its loathsome jaws when he fell.Then it had dragged
him beneath the yellow waters, where he was seen no more.Life is held cheaply by the Magdalena <DW64>--excepting his own.Shiftless and improvident child of the tropics, his animal wants
are readily satisfied by the fruits and fish which nature provides
for him so bountifully.Spiritual wants he has none--until calamity
touches him and he thinks he is about to die.Then witchcraft, charm,
incantation, the priest--anything that promises help is hurriedly
pressed into requisition to prolong his useless existence.If he
recovers, he forgets it all as hurriedly.The tragedy which had
just been enacted before the Honda's crew produced a ripple of
excitement--a momentary stirring of emotion--and was then speedily
forgotten, while the boat turned and drove its way up-stream against
the muddy waters.Nature had endowed him with a memory which
recorded as minutely and as lastingly as the phonographic cylinder.The violent death of the boy haunted him, and mingled with the
recurrent memories of the sad passing of the little Maria, and his own
bitter life experience.Did this infinite variety of good and evil which we
call life unite to manifest an infinite Creator?Nay, for then were
God more wicked than the lowest sinner!Was evil as real as good, and
more powerful?Did love and the soul's desire to be and do good
count for nothing in the end?No; for the end is death--always death!"We are coming to Banco, Padre," said the man who had addressed Jose
before, rousing him from his doleful meditations and pointing to the
lights of the distant town, now shimmering through the gathering
dusk.As the boat with shrilly shrieking whistle drew near the landing, a
crowd hurriedly gathered on the bank to receive it.Venders of guava
jelly, rude pottery, and straw mats hastily spread out their
merchandise on the muddy ground and began to dilate loudly on their
merits.A scantily clad man held aloft a rare leopard skin, which he
vigorously offered for two _pesos_ gold.Slatternly women, peddling
queer delectables of uncertain composition, waved their thin, bare
arms and shrilly advertised their wares.Black, naked children bobbed
excitedly about; and gaunt dogs and shrieking pigs scampered
recklessly through the crowd and added to the general confusion.Here
and there Jose could see dignified looking men, dressed in white
cotton, and wearing straw--_jipijapa_--hats.These were merchants,
patiently awaiting consignments which they had perhaps ordered months
before.Crazy, ramshackle dwellings, perched unsteadily upon long,
slender stilts, rose from the water's edge; but substantial brick
buildings of fair size, with red-tile roofs and whitewashed walls,
mingled at intervals with the thatched mud huts and rude hovels
farther within the town.In a distant doorway he descried a woman
nursing a babe at one breast and a suckling pig at the other.Convention is rigid in these Colombian river towns; but it is widely
inclusive."Come ashore with me, Padre, and forget what is worrying you," said
Jose's new acquaintance, taking him by the arm."I have friends
here--_Hola!_ Padre Diego Guillermo!"he suddenly called, catching
sight of a black-frocked priest standing in the crowd on the shore.The priest addressed, a short, stout, coarse-featured man of perhaps
forty, waved back a vigorous salutation."_Hombre!_" the man ejaculated, holding Jose's arm and starting down
the gangplank."What new deviltry is the rogue up to now!"The man and the priest addressed as Diego embraced warmly."Padre Diego Guillermo Polo, I have the extreme honor to present my
friend, the eminent Padre--" ceremoniously waving a hand toward Jose."Jose de Rincon," supplied the latter, bowing.Then, abruptly, "Of Cartagena?""Yes," returned Jose, with awakened interest."My grandfather," Jose replied promptly, and with a touch of pride.he owned much property--many _fincas_--about here; and farther
west, in the Guamoco country, many mines, eh, Don Jorge?"exchanging a
significant look with the latter."But," he added, glancing at the perspiring Honda, "this old tub is
going to hang up here for the night.So do me the honor, senores, to
visit my little cell, and we will fight the cursed mosquitoes over a
sip of red rum.Jose and Don Jorge bowed their acquiescence and followed him up the
muddy road.The cell referred to consisted of a suite of several
rooms, commodiously furnished, and looking out from the second story
of one of the better colonial houses of the town upon a richly
blooming interior _patio_.As the visitors entered, a comely young
woman who had just lighted an oil-burning "student" lamp and placed it
upon the center table, disappeared into one of the more remote rooms."My niece," said the priest Diego, winking at Don Jorge as he set out
cigars and a _garrafon_ of Jamaica rum."I have ordered a case of
American beer," he continued, lighting a cigar."But that was two
months ago, and it hasn't arrived yet._Diablo!_ but the good _medico_
tells me I drink too much rum for this very Christian climate."Don Jorge swept the place with an appraising glance."H'm," he
commented, as he poured himself a liberal libation from the
_garrafon_."The Lord surely provides for His faithful children.""Yes, the Lord, that's right," laughed Padre Diego; "still I am daily
rendering no small thanks to His Grace, Don Wenceslas, future Bishop
of Cartagena.""And eminent services into the bargain, I'll venture," added Don
Jorge.Padre Diego's eyes twinkled merrily.Then even in this
remote town the artful Wenceslas maintained his agent!"But our friend is neither drinking nor smoking," said Padre Diego,
turning inquiringly to Jose, who had left his glass untouched."With your permission," replied the latter; "I do not use liquor or
tobacco.""_Por Dios!_ what is it
the Dutchman says?'Wer nicht liebt Wein, Weib und Gesang,
               Der bleibt ein Narr sein Lebenlang.'"_Caramba!_ but my German has all slipped from me.""Don't worry," commented Don Jorge cynically; "for I'll wager it took
nothing good with it.""_Hombre!_ but you are hard on a loyal servant of the Lord," exclaimed
Padre Diego in a tone of mock injury, as he drained another glass of
the fiery liquor."Of the Lord Pope, Lord
Wenceslas, or the Lord God, may we ask?""_Que chiste!_ Why, stupid, all three.I do not put all my eggs into
one basket, however large.But tell me, now," he inquired, turning the
conversation from himself, "what is it brings you into this region
forsaken of the gods?""_Sepulcros_," Don Jorge briefly announced.But have you abandoned your quest of _La
Tumba del Diablo_, in the Sinu valley?""Naturally, since the records show that it was opened centuries ago.And I spent a good year's search on it, too!_Dios!_ They say it
yielded above thirty thousand _pesos_ gold.""_Diablo!_"

"But I am on the track of others.I go now to Medellin; then to
Remedios; and there outfit for a trip of grave hunting through the old
Guamoco district."Then you will naturally come down the Simiti trail, which
brings you out to the Magdalena.""I had charge of that
parish for a few months--"

"But found it highly convenient to leave, no?""_Caramba!_ Would you have me die of _ennui_ in such a hell-hole?""_Hombre!_ Yes--worse!They say that after the good Lord created
heaven and earth He had a few handfuls of dirt left, and these He
threw away.But crafty Satan, always with an eye single to going the
Lord one better, slyly gathered this dirt together again and made
Simiti."Diego quickly finished another glass of rum, as if he would
drown the memory of the town."Then in that case," he said, brightening,
"we are brother sinners.What was your
crime, if one may ask?"And the coarse fellow settled
back expectantly in his chair."_Caramba!_" returned the Padre impatiently."You surely know that no
respectable priest is ever sent to Simiti!That it is the good
Bishop's penal colony for fallen clergy--and, I may add, the refuge of
political offenders of this and adjacent countries.Why, the present
schoolmaster there is a political outcast from Salvador!""No, I did not know it," replied Jose."_Por Dios!_ Then you are being jobbed, _amigo_!Did Don Wenceslas
give you letters to the Alcalde?""And--by the way, has Wenceslas been misbehaving of late?--for when he
does, somebody other than himself has to settle the score.""Ah," mused Diego, "but Don Wenceslas is artful.And yet, I think I
see the direction of his trained hand in this."Then he burst into a
rude laugh."Come, _amigo_," he said, noting Jose's dejected mien;
"let us have your story.And we've had
experience--eh, Don Jorge?"Simiti would
serve as well to bury him as any other tomb.He knew he was sent as a
lamb to the slaughter.But it was his affair--and his God's.Honor and
conscience had presented the score; and he was paying in full.His was
not a story to be bandied about by lewd priests like Padre Diego."No," he replied to the Padre's insistent solicitations; "with your
permission, we will talk of it no more."cried the Padre at last, in his coarse way stirred by
Jose's evident truthfulness."Well--as you wish--I will not pry into
your secrets.But, take a bit of counsel from one who knows: when you
reach Simiti, inquire for a man who hates me, one Rosendo Ariza--"

At this juncture the Honda's diabolical whistle pierced the murky
night air."_Caramba!_" cried Don Jorge, starting up."Are they going to try the
river to-night?"The moon was up, and the boat was getting under way.Padre Diego went
aboard to take leave of his friends."_Bien, amigo_," he said to Don Jorge; "I am sorry your stay is so
short.Interesting developments are forward,
and I hope you are well out of Guamoco when the trouble starts.For
the rivals of Antioquia and Simiti will pay off a few scores in the
next revolution--a few left over from the last; and it would be well
not to get caught between them when they come together."_Hombre!_ It is all but here!The Hercules went up-river
yesterday.She has gone to keep a look-out in the
vicinity of Puerto Berrio.I am sorry for our friend," nodding toward
Jose, who was leaning over the boat's rail at some distance; "but
there is a job there.only another priest less--and a weak-kneed one at that," said
Don Jorge with contempt; "and we have too many of them now, Lord
knows!""You forget that I am a priest," chuckled Diego.Yes, so you are," laughed Don Jorge; "but of the diocese of
hell!I'll send a runner down the trail when I reach
the Tigui river; and if you will have a letter in Simiti informing me
of the status of things political, he can bring it up._Conque_,
_adios_, my consummate villain."The Honda, whistling prodigiously, swung out into mid-stream and set
her course up-river, warily feeling through the velvety darkness for
the uncertain channel.Once she grated over a hidden bar and hung for
a few moments, while her stack vomited torrents of sparks and her
great wheel angrily churned the water into creamy foam in the clear
moonlight.Once, rounding a sharp bend, she collided squarely with a
huge mahogany tree, rolling and plunging menacingly in the seaward
rushing waters."_Diablo!_" muttered Don Jorge, as he helped Jose swing his hammock
and adjust the mosquito netting."I shall offer a candle a foot thick
to the blessed Virgin if I reach Puerto Berrio safely!_Santo Dios!_"
as the boat grazed another sand bar."I've heard tell of steamers
hanging up on bars in this river for six weeks!pointing to
the projecting smoke-stack of a sunken steamer."_Caramba!_ That is
what we just escaped!"But Jose manifested slight interest in the dangers of river
navigation.His thoughts were revolving about the incidents of the
past few days, and, more especially, about Padre Diego and his
significant words.Don Jorge had volunteered no further explanation of
the man or his conversation; and Jose's reticence would not permit him
to make other inquiry.But, after all, his thought-processes always
evolved the same conclusion: What mattered it now?His interest in
life was at an end.He had not told Don Jorge of his experience with
the leper in Maganguey.But his hand ached
cruelly; and the pain was always associated with loathsome and
repellant thoughts of the event.*       *       *       *       *

The eastern sky was blushing at the approach of the amorous sun when
Jose left his hammock and prepared to endure another day on the river.To the south the deep blue vault of heaven was dotted with downy
clouds.Behind the laboring steamer the river glittered through a
dazzling white haze.Ahead, its course was traceable for miles by the
thin vapor always rising from it.The jungle on either side was
brilliant with color and resonant with the songs of forest lyrists.In
the lofty fronds of venerable palms and cedars noisy macaws gossiped
and squabbled, and excited monkeys discussed the passing boat and
commented volubly on its character.In the shallow water at the margin
of the river blue herons and spindle-legged cranes were searching out
their morning meal.Crocodiles lay dozing on the _playas_, with mouths
opened invitingly to the stupid birds which were sure to yield to the
mesmerism.Far in the distance up-stream a young deer was drinking at
the water's edge.The charm of the rare scene held the priest spellbound.As he gazed
upon it a king vulture--called by the natives the Vulture Papa, or
Pope Vulture--suddenly swooped down from the depths of heaven and,
lighting upon the carcass of a monster crocodile floating down the
river, began to feast upon the choicest morsels, while the buzzards
which had been circling about the carrion and feeding at will
respectfully withdrew until the royal appetite should be satiated."Those
brainless buzzards, if they only knew it and had sense enough to
unite, could strip every feather off that swaggering vulture and send
him packing.And we poor Colombians, if we had the courage,
could as easily throw the Church into the sea, holy candles, holy
oils, holy incense and all!_Diablo!_ But we are fleeced like sheep!"To Jose it did not seem strange that this man should speak so frankly
to him, a priest.He felt that Don Jorge was not so much lacking in
courtesy and delicate respect for the feelings and opinions of others
as he was ruggedly honest and fearlessly sincere in his hatred of the
dissimulation and graft practiced upon the ignorant and unsuspecting.For the rest of the day Don Jorge was busy with his maps and papers,
and Jose was left to himself.The character of the landscape had altered with the narrowing of the
stream, and the river-plain now lay in a great volcanic basin flanked
by distant verdure-clad hills.Far to the southwest Jose could see the
faint outlines of the lofty _Cordilleras_.Somewhere in that direction
lay Simiti.And back of it lay the ancient treasure house of Spain,
where countless thousands of sweating slaves had worn out their
straining bodies under the goad and lash, that the monarchs of Castile
might carry on their foolish religious wars and attempt their vain
projects of self-aggrandizement.The day wore on without interest, and darkness closed in quickly when
the sun dropped behind the _Sierras_.It was to be Jose's last night
on the Magdalena, for the captain had told him that, barring disaster,
the next afternoon should find them at Badillo.After the evening meal
the priest took his chair to the bow of the steamer and gave himself
over to the gentle influences of the rare and soothing environment.The churning of the boat was softly echoed by the sleeping forest.The
late moon shimmered through clouds of murky vapor, and cast ghostly
reflections along the broad river.The balmy air, trembling with the
radiating heat, was impregnated with sweetest odors from the myriad
buds and balsamic plants of the dark jungle wilderness on either hand,
where impervious walls rose in majestic, deterrant, awesome silence
from the low shore line, and tangled shrubs and bushes, rioting in
wild profusion, jealously hung to the water's edge that they might
hide every trace of the muddy banks.What shapes and forms the black
depths of that untrodden bush hid from his eyes, Jose might only
imagine.But he felt their presence--crawling, creeping things that
lay in patient ambush for their unwitting prey--slimy lizards,
gorgeously caparisoned--dank, twisting serpents--elephantine
tapirs--dull-witted sloths--sleek, wary jaguars--fierce formicidae,
poisonous and carnivorous.He might not see them, but he felt that he
was the cynosure of hundreds of keen eyes that followed him as the
boat glided close to the shore and silently crept through the shadows
which lay thick upon the river's edge.And the matted jungle, with its
colossal vegetation, he felt was peopled with other things--influences
intangible, and perhaps still unreal, but mightily potent with the
symbolized presence of the great Unknown, which stands back of all
phenomena and eagerly watches the movements of its children.These
influences had already cast their spell upon him.He was yielding,
slowly, to the "lure of the tropics," which few who come under its
attachment ever find the strength to dispel.No habitations were visible on the dark shores.Only here and there in
the yellow glow of the boat's lanterns appeared the customary piles
of wood which the natives sell to the passing steamers for boiler
fuel, and which are found at frequent intervals along the river.At
one of these the Honda halted to replenish its supply.The usual
bickering between the <DW64> owner and the boat captain resulted in a
bargain, and the half-naked stevedores began to transfer the wood to
the vessel, carrying it on their shoulders in the most primitive
manner, held in a strip of burlap.The rising moon had at last thrown
off its veil of murky clouds, and was shining in undimmed splendor in
a starry sky.Jose went ashore with the passengers; for the boat might
remain there for hours while her crew labored leisurely, with much
bantering and singing, and no anxious thought for the morrow.The strumming of a _tiple_ in the distance attracted him.Following
it, he found a small settlement of bamboo huts hidden away in a
beautiful grove of moriche palms, through which the moonbeams filtered
in silvery stringers.Little gardens lay back of the dwellings, and
the usual number of goats and pigs were dozing in the heavy shadows of
the scarcely stirring trees.Reserved matrons and shy _doncellas_
appeared in the doorways; and curious children, naked and chubby, hid
in their mothers' scant skirts and peeped cautiously out at the
newcomers.The tranquil night was sweet with delicate odors wafted
from numberless plants and blossoms in the adjacent forest, and with
the fragrance breathed from the roses, gardenias and dahlias with
which these unpretentious dwellings were fairly embowered.A spirit of
calm and peaceful contentment hovered over the spot, and the round,
white moon smiled down in holy benediction upon the gentle folk who
passed their simple lives in this bower of delight, free from the goad
of human ambition, untrammeled by the false sense of wealth and its
entailments, and unspoiled by the artificialities of civilization.One of the passengers suggested a dance, while waiting for the boat to
take on its fuel.The owner of the wood, apparently the chief
authority of the little settlement, immediately procured a _tom-tom_,
and gave orders for the _baile_.At his direction men, women and
children gathered in the moonlit clearing on the river bank and, while
the musician beat a monotonous tattoo on the crude drum, circled about
in the stately and dignified movements of their native dance.It was a picture that Jose would not forget.The balmy air, soft as
velvet, and laden with delicious fragrance; the vast solitude,
stretching in trackless wilderness to unknown reaches on either hand;
the magic stillness of the tropic night; the figures of the dancers
weirdly silhouetted in the gorgeous moonlight; with the low, unvaried
beat of the _tom-tom_ rising dully through the warm air--all merged
into a scene of exquisite beauty and delight, which made an indelible
impression upon the priest's receptive mind.And when the sounds of simple happiness had again died into silence,
and he lay in his hammock, listening to the spirit of the jungle
sighing through the night-blown palms, as the boat glided gently
through the lights and shadows of the quiet river, his soul voiced a
nameless yearning, a vague, unformed longing for an approach to the
life of simple content and child-like happiness of the kind and gentle
folk with whom he had been privileged to make this brief sojourn.*       *       *       *       *

The crimson flush of the dawn-sky heralded another day of implacable
heat.The emerald coronals of palms and towering _caobas_ burned in
the early beams of the torrid sun.Light fogs rose reluctantly from
the river's bosom and dispersed in delicate vapors of opal and violet.The tangled banks of dripping bush shone freshly green in the misty
light.The wilderness, grim and trenchant, reigned in unchallenged
despotism.Solitude, soul-oppressing, unbroken but for the calls of
feathered life, brooded over the birth of Jose's last day on the
Magdalena.About midday the steamer touched at the little village of
Bodega Central; but the iron-covered warehouse and the whitewashed mud
hovels glittered garishly in the fierce heat and stifled all desire to
go ashore.The call was brief, and the boat soon resumed its course
through the solitude and heat of the mighty river.Immediately after leaving Bodega Central, Don Jorge approached Jose
and beckoned him to an unoccupied corner of the boat."_Amigo_," he began, after assuring himself that his words would not
carry to the other passengers, "the captain tells me the next stop is
Badillo, where you leave us.If all goes well you will be in Simiti
to-night.No doubt a report of our meeting with Padre Diego has
already reached Don Wenceslas, who, you may be sure, has no thought of
forgetting you.I have no reason to tell you this other than the fact
that I think, as Padre Diego put it, you are being jobbed--not by the
Church, but by Wenceslas.I want to warn you, that is all.They got me early--got my wife and girl, too!I hate the
Church, and the whole ghastly farce which it puts over on the ignorant
people of this country!But--," eying him sharply, "I would hardly
class you as a _real_ priest.You meant
well, but something happened--as always does when one means well in
this world.Shifting his chair closer to Jose, the man resumed earnestly."Your grandfather, Don Ignacio, was a very rich man.His _fincas_ and herds and mines
melted away from him like grease from a holy candle.And nobody
cared--any more than the Lord cares about candle grease.Most of his
property fell into the hands of his former slaves--and he had hundreds
of them hereabouts.But his most valuable possession, the great mine
of La Libertad, disappeared as completely as if blotted from the face
of the earth."That mine--no, not a mine, but a mountain of free gold--was located
somewhere in the Guamoco district.After the war this whole country
slipped back into the jungle, and had to be rediscovered.The Guamoco
region is to-day as unknown as it was before the Spaniards came.Somewhere in the district, but covered deep beneath brush and forest
growth, is that mine, the richest in Colombia."Now, as you know, Don Ignacio left this country in considerable of a
hurry.But I think he always intended to come back again.But the fact remains that
La Libertad has never been rediscovered since Don Ignacio's day.The
old records in Cartagena show the existence of such a mine in Spanish
times, and give a more or less accurate statement of its production.The old fellow had _arrastras_,
mills, and so on, in which slaves crushed the ore.The bullion was
melted into bars and brought down the trail to Simiti, where he had
agents and warehouses and a store or two.From there it was shipped
down the river to Cartagena.And
during that time everything was in a state of terrible confusion."_Bueno_; so much for history.Now to your friends on the coast--and
elsewhere.Don Wenceslas is quietly searching for that mine--has been
for years.He put his agent, Padre Diego, in Simiti to learn what he
might there.But the fool priest was run out after he had ruined a
woman or two.However, Padre Diego is still in close touch with the
town, and is on the keen search for La Libertad.Wenceslas thinks
there may be descendants of some of Don Ignacio's old slaves still
living in Simiti, or near there, and that they know the location of
the lost mine.And, if I mistake not, he figures that you will learn
the secret from them in some way, and that the mine will again come to
light.Now, if you get wind of that mine and attempt to locate it, or
purchase it from the natives, you will be beaten out of it in a hurry.And you may be sure Don Wenceslas will be the one who will eventually
have it, for there is no craftier, smoother, brighter rascal in
Colombia than he.And so, take it from me, if you ever get wind of the
location of that famous property--which by rights is yours, having
belonged to your grandfather--_keep the information strictly to
yourself_!But I shall be working in the Guamoco district
for many months to come, hunting Indian graves.I shall have my
runners up and down the Simiti trail frequently, and may get in touch
with you.It may be that you will need a friend.The boat is
whistling for Badillo.A last word: Keep out of the way of both
Wenceslas and Diego--cultivate the people of Simiti--and keep your
mouth closed."A few minutes later Jose stood on the river bank beside his little
haircloth trunk and traveling bag, sadly watching the steamer draw
away and resume her course up-stream.He watched it until it
disappeared around a bend.And then he stood watching the smoke rise
above the treetops, until that, too, faded in the distance.No one had
waved him a farewell from the boat.No one met him with a greeting of
welcome on the shore.He turned, with a heavy heart, to note his environment.It was a
typical riverine point.A single street, if it might be so called; a
half dozen bamboo dwellings, palm-thatched; and a score of natives,
with their innumerable gaunt dogs and porcine companions--this was
Badillo."_Senor Padre._" A tall, finely built native, clad in soiled white
cotton shirt and trousers, approached and addressed him in a kindly
tone."To Simiti," replied the priest, turning eagerly to the man."But," in
bewilderment, "where is it?""Over there," answered the native, pointing to the jungle on the far
side of the river.The wearied priest sat down on his trunk and buried his face in his
hands.It was the after-effect of his
long and difficult river experience.Or, perhaps, the deadly malaria
was beginning its insidious poisoning.The man approached and laid a
hand on his shoulder."Padre, why do you go to Simiti?"Jose raised his head and looked more closely at his interlocutor.The
native was a man of perhaps sixty years.His figure was that of an
athlete.He stood well over six feet high, with massive shoulders, and
a waist as slender as a woman's.His face was almost black in color,
and mottled with patches of white, so common to the natives of the hot
inlands.But there was that in its expression, a something that
looked out through those kindly black eyes, that assured Jose and
bespoke his confidence."I have been sent there by the Bishop of Cartagena.I am to have
charge of the parish," Jose replied."We want no priest in Simiti," he said with quiet firmness.His manner
of speaking was abrupt, yet not ungracious."Then you must know a man--Rosendo, I think his name--"

"I am Rosendo Ariza.""Rosendo--I am sick--I think.And--I have--no friends--"

Rosendo quickly grasped his hand and slipped an arm about his
shoulders."I am your friend, Padre--" He stopped and appeared to reflect for a
moment.Then he added quickly, "My canoe is ready; and we must hurry,
or night will overtake us."The priest essayed to rise, but stumbled.Then, as if he had been a
child, the man Rosendo picked him up and carried him down the bank to
a rude canoe, where he deposited him on a pile of empty bags in the
keel.he called back to a young man who seemed to be the
chief character of the village."Sell the _panela_ and yuccas _a buen
precio_; and remind Captain Julio not to forget on the next trip to
bring the little Carmen a doll from Barranquilla.And Juan," addressing the sturdy youth who was preparing
to accompany him, "set in the Padre's baggage; and do you take the
paddle, and I will pole._Conque, adioscito!_" waving his battered
straw hat to the natives congregated on the bank, while Juan pushed
the canoe from the shore and paddled vigorously out into the river.Don Rosendo y Juan!_" The hearty farewells of
the natives followed the canoe far out into the broad stream.Across the open river in the livid heat of the early afternoon the
canoe slowly made its way.The sun from a cloudless sky viciously
poured down its glowing rays like molten metal.The boat burned; the
river steamed; the water was hot to his touch, when the priest feebly
dipped his hands into it and bathed his throbbing brow.Badillo faded
from view as they rounded a densely wooded island and entered a long
lagoon.Here they lost the slight breeze which they had had on the
main stream.In this narrow channel, hemmed in between lofty forest
walls of closely woven vines and foliage, it seemed to Jose that they
had entered a flaming inferno.The two boatmen sat silent and
inscrutable, plying their paddles without speaking.Down the long lagoon the canoe drifted, keeping within what scant
shade the banks afforded, for the sun stood now directly overhead.The
heat was everywhere, insistent, unpitying.The foliage on either side of the channel merged into the hot waves
that rose trembling about them.The thin, burning air enveloped the
little craft with fire.The quivering
appearance of the atmosphere robbed him of confidence in his own
vision.A cloud of insects hung always before his sight.Not a bird or
animal betrayed its presence.The canoe was edging the Colombian
"hells," where even the denizens of the forest dare not venture forth
on the low, open _savannas_ in the killing heat of midday.Jose sank down in the boat, wilting and semi-delirious.Through his
dimmed eyes the boatman looked like glowing inhuman things set in
flames.Rosendo came to him and placed his straw hat over his face.Hours, interminable and torturing, seemed to pass on leaden wings.Then Juan, deftly swerving his paddle, shot the canoe into a narrow
arm, and the garish sunlight was suddenly lost in the densely
intertwined branches overhanging the little stream."The outlet of _La Cienaga_, Padre," Rosendo offered, laying aside his
paddle and taking his long boat pole."Lake Simiti flows through this
and into the Magdalena."For a few moments he held the canoe steady,
while from his wallet he drew a few leaves of tobacco and deftly
rolled a long, thick cigar.The real work of the _boga_ now began, and Rosendo with his long
punter settled down to the several hours' strenuous grind which was
necessary to force the heavy canoe up the little outlet and into the
distant lake beyond.Back and forth he traveled through the
half-length of the boat, setting the pole well forward in the soft
bank, or out into the stream itself, and then, with its end against
his shoulder, urging and teasing the craft a few feet at a time
against the strong current.Jose imagined, as he dully watched him,
that he could see death in the pestiferous effluvia which emanated
from the black, slimy mud which every plunge of the long pole brought
to the surface of the narrow stream.The afternoon slowly waned, and the temperature lowered a few degrees.A warm, animal-like breath drifted languidly out from the moist
jungle.The outlet, or _cano_, was heavily shaded throughout its
length.Crocodiles lay along its muddy banks, and slid into the water
at the approach of the canoe.Huge _iguanas_, the gorgeously 
lizards of tropical America, scurried noisily through the overarching
branches.Here and there monkeys peeped curiously at the intruders and
chattered excitedly as they swung among the lofty treetops.But for
his exhaustion, Jose, as he lay propped up against his trunk, gazing
vacantly upon the slowly unrolling panorama of marvelous plant and
animal life on either hand, might have imagined himself in a realm of
enchantment.At length the vegetation abruptly ceased; the stream widened; and the
canoe entered a broad lake, at the far end of which, three miles
distant, its two whitewashed churches and its plastered houses
reflecting the red glow of the setting sun, lay the ancient and
decayed town of Simiti, the northern outlet of Spain's mediaeval
treasure house, at the edge of the forgotten district of Guamoco.Paddling gently across the unruffled surface of the tepid waters,
Rosendo and Juan silently urged the canoe through the fast gathering
dusk, and at length drew up on the shaly beach of the old town.As
they did so, a little girl, bare of feet and with clustering brown
curls, came running out of the darkness."Oh, padre Rosendo," she called, "what have you brought me?"Then, as she saw Rosendo and Juan assisting the priest from the boat,
she drew back abashed."Look, Carmencita," whispered Juan to the little maid; "we've brought
you a _big_ doll, haven't we?"Night fell as the priest stepped upon the shore of his new home.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


Jose de Rincon opened his eyes and turned painfully on his hard bed.The early sun streamed through the wooden grating before the unglazed
window.A slight, tepid breeze stirred the mosquito netting over him.He was in the single sleeping room of the house.It contained another
bed like his own, of rough _macana_ palm strips, over which lay a
straw mat and a thin red blanket.On the rude door, cobwebbed and dusty, a scorpion clung torpidly.From
the room beyond he heard subdued voices.His head and limbs ached
dully; and frightful memories of the river trip and the awful journey
from Badillo sickened him.With painful exertion he stood upon the
moist dirt floor and drew on his damp clothes.He had only a vague
recollection of the preceding night, but he knew that Rosendo had half
led, half dragged him past rows of dimly lighted, ghostly white houses
to his own abode, and there had put him to bed."_Muy buenos dias, Senor Padre_," Rosendo greeted him, as the priest
dragged himself out into the living room.But
the senora will soon have your breakfast.Rosendo placed one of the rough wooden chairs, with straight cowhide
back and seat, near the table."Carmencita has gone to the boat for fresh water.Pour the _Senor Padre_ a cup, _carita_," addressing a little girl who
at that moment entered the doorway, carrying a large earthen bottle on
her shoulder.It was the child who had met the boat when the priest
arrived the night, before."Fill the basin, too, _chiquita_, that the Padre may wash his hands,"
added Rosendo.The child approached Jose, and with a dignified little courtesy and a
frank smile offered him a cup of the lukewarm water.The priest
accepted it languidly.But, glancing into her face, his eyes suddenly
widened, and the hand that was carrying the tin cup to his lips
stopped.The barefoot girl, clad only in a short, sleeveless calico gown, stood
before him like a portrait from an old master.Her skin was almost
white, with but a tinge of olive.Her dark brown hair hung in curls to
her shoulders and framed a face of rarest beauty.Innocence, purity,
and love radiated from her fair features, from her beautifully rounded
limbs, from her soft, dark eyes that looked so fearlessly into his
own.Somewhere deep within his soul a
chord had been suddenly struck by the little presence; and the sound
was unfamiliar to him.Yet it awakened memories of distant scenes, of
old dreams, and forgotten longings.It seemed to echo from realms of
his soul that had never been penetrated.The man forgot himself, forgot that
he had come to Simiti to die.He remained conscious only of something that he could not
outline, something in the soul of the child, a thing that perhaps he
once possessed, and that he knew he yet prized above all else on
earth.He heard Rosendo's voice through an immeasurable distance--

"Leave us now, _chiquita_; the Padre wishes to have his breakfast."The child without speaking turned obediently; and the priest's eyes
followed her until she disappeared into the kitchen."We call her 'the smile of God,'" said Rosendo, noting the priest's
absorption, "because she is always happy.""Yes, Padre, she is heaven's gift to us poor folk.I sometimes think
the angels themselves left her on the river bank.""Why--she was not born
here?""Oh, no, Padre, but in Badillo.""Ah, then you once lived in Badillo?""_Na, Senor Padre_, she is not my child--except that the good God has
given her to me to protect."The priest's voice was unwontedly
eager and his manner animated.But Rosendo fell suddenly quiet and embarrassed, as if he realized
that already he had said too much to a stranger.A shade of suspicion
seemed to cross his face, and he rose hurriedly and went out into the
kitchen.A moment later he returned with the priest's breakfast--two
fried eggs, a hot corn _arepa_, fried _platanos_, dried fish, and
coffee sweetened with _panela_."When you have finished, Padre, we will visit the Alcalde," he said
quietly."I must go down to the lake now to speak with Juan before he
goes out to fish."The interest which had been aroused by
the child continued to increase without reaction.His torpid soul had
been profoundly stirred.For the moment, though he knew not why, life
seemed to hold a vague, unshaped interest for him.He began to notice
his environment; he even thought he relished the coarse food set
before him.The house he was in was a typical native three-room dwelling, built of
strips of _macana_ palm, set upright and tied together with pieces of
slender, tough _bejuco_ vine.The interstices between the strips were
filled with mud, and the whole whitewashed.The floors were dirt,
trodden hard; the steep-pitched roof was thatched with palm.A few
chairs like the one he occupied, the rude, uncovered table, some cheap
prints and a battered crucifix on the wall, were the only furnishings
of the living room.While he was eating, the people of the town congregated quietly
about the open door.Friendly curiosity to see the new Padre, and
sincere desire to welcome him animated their simple minds.Naked
babes crawled to the threshold and peeped timidly in.Coarsely
clad women and young girls, many of the latter bedizened with bits
of bright ribbon or cheap trinkets, smiled their gentle greetings.Black, dignified men, bare of feet, and wearing white cotton trousers
and black _ruanas_--the cape affected by the poor males of the
inlands--respectfully doffed their straw hats and bowed to him.Rosendo's wife appeared from the kitchen and extended her hand to
him in unfeigned hospitality.Attired in a fresh calico gown, her
black hair plastered back over her head and tied with a clean black
ribbon, her bare feet encased in hemp sandals, she bore herself
with that grace and matronly dignity so indicative of her Spanish
forbears, and so particularly characteristic of the inhabitants of
this "valley of the pleasant 'yes.'"Breakfast finished, the priest stepped to the doorway and raised his
hand in the invocation that was evidently expected from him."_Dominus vobiscum_," he repeated, not mechanically, not insincerely,
but in a spirit of benevolence, of genuine well-wishing, which his
contact with the child a few minutes before seemed to have aroused.The people bent their heads piously and murmured, "_Et cum spiritu
tuo._"

The open door looked out upon the central _plaza_, where stood a large
church of typical colonial design and construction, and with a single
lateral bell tower.The building was set well up on a platform of
shale, with broad shale steps, much broken and worn, leading up to it
on all sides.Jose stepped out and mingled with the crowd, first
regarding the old church curiously, and then looking vainly for the
little girl, and sighing his disappointment when he did not see her.In the _plaza_ he was joined by Rosendo; and together they went to
the house of the Alcalde.On the way the priest gazed about him with
growing curiosity.To the north of the town stretched the lake, known
to the residents only by the name of _La Cienaga_.It was a body of
water of fair size, in a setting of exquisite tropical beauty.In
a temperate climate, and a region more densely populated, this
lake would have been priceless.Here in forgotten Guamoco it lay like
an undiscovered gem, known only to those few inert and passive folk,
who enjoyed it with an inadequate sense of its rare beauty and
immeasurable worth.Several small and densely wooded isles rose
from its unrippled bosom; and tropical birds of brilliant color
hovered over it in the morning sun.Near one of its margins Jose
distinguished countless white _garzas_, the graceful herons whose
plumes yield the coveted aigrette of northern climes.They fed
undisturbed, for this region sleeps unmolested, far from the beaten
paths of tourist or vandal huntsman.To the west and south lay the
hills of Guamoco, and the lofty _Cordilleras_, purpling in the
light mist.Over the entire scene spread a damp warmth, like the
atmosphere of a hot-house.By midday Jose knew that the heat would
be insufferable.The Alcalde, Don Mario Arvila, conducted his visitors through his
shabby little store and into the _patio_ in the rear, exclaiming
repeatedly, "Ah, _Senor Padre_, we welcome you!All Simiti welcomes
you and kisses your hand!"In the shade of his arbor he sat down to
examine Jose's letters from Cartagena.Don Mario was a large, florid man, huge of girth, with brown skin,
heavy jowls, puffed eyes, and bald head.As he read, his eyes snapped,
and at times he paused and looked up curiously at the priest.Then,
without comment, he folded the letters and put them into a pocket of
his crash coat."_Bien_," he said politely, "we must have the Padre meet Don Felipe
Alcozer as soon as he returns.Some repairs are needed on the
church; a few of the roof tiles have slipped, and the rain enters.Perhaps, _Senor Padre_, you may say the Mass there next Sunday.A--a--you had illustrious ancestors, Padre," he added with
hesitation.asked Jose with something of
mingled surprise and pride."They speak of your family, which was, as we all know, quite
renowned," replied the Alcalde courteously."Very," agreed Jose, wondering how much the Alcalde knew of his
family."Don Ignacio was not unknown in this _pueblo_," affably continued the
Alcalde.At these words Rosendo started visibly and looked fixedly at the
priest."The family name of Rincon," the Alcalde went on, "appears on the old
records of Simiti in many places, and it is said that Don Ignacio
himself came here more than once.Perhaps you know, _Senor Padre_,
that the Rincon family erected the church which stands in the _plaza_?And so it is quite appropriate that their son should officiate in it
after all these centuries, is it not?"He
knew little of his family's history.Of their former vast wealth he
had a vague notion.But here in this land of romance and tragedy he
seemed to be running upon their reliques everywhere.The conversation drifted to parish matters; and soon Rosendo urged
their departure, as the sun was mounting high.Seated at the table for the midday lunch, Jose again became lost in
contemplation of the child before him.Her fair face flushed under his
searching gaze; but she returned a smile of confidence and sweet
innocence that held him spellbound.Her great brown eyes were of
infinite depth.They expressed a something that he had never seen
before in human eyes.What was it
that through them looked out into this world of evil?Childish
innocence and purity, yes; but vastly more.Through his meditations he heard Rosendo's
voice."Simiti is very old, Padre.In the days of the Spaniards it was a
large town, with many rich people.The Indians were all slaves then,
and they worked in the mines up there," indicating the distant
mountains."Much gold was brought down here and shipped down the
Magdalena, for the _cano_ was wider in those days, and it was not so
hard to reach the river.This is the end of the Guamoco trail, which
was called in those days the _Camino Real_."interrogated Jose; not that the
question expressed a more than casual interest, but rather to keep
Rosendo talking while he studied the child.But at this question Rosendo suddenly became less loquacious.Jose
then felt that he was suspected of prying into matters which Rosendo
did not wish to discuss with him, and so he pressed the topic no
further."How many people did Don Mario say the parish contained?"he asked by
way of diverting the conversation."Four years since Padre Diego was here," commented Jose casually.At the mention of the former priest's
name Dona Maria hurriedly left the table.Rosendo's black face grew
even darker, and took on a look of ineffable contempt.It was now plain to Jose that Rosendo distrusted him.But it mattered
little to the priest, beyond the fact that he had no wish to offend
any one.What interest had he in boorish Simiti, or Guamoco?The place
was become his tomb--he had entered it to die.Ah, yes, she had touched a strange chord within him; and for a time he
had seemed to live again.But as the day waned, and pitiless heat and
deadly silence brooded over the decayed town, his starving soul sank
again into its former depression, and revived hope and interest died
within him.The implacable heat burned through the noon hour; the dusty streets
were like the floor of a stone oven; the shale beds upon which the old
town rested sent up fiery, quivering waves; the houses seethed; earth
and sky were ablaze.And the terrible _ennui_, the isolation, the utter lack of every trace
of culture, of the varied interests that feed the educated, trained
mind and minister to its comfort and growth--could he support it
patiently while awaiting the end?Would he go mad before the final
release came?He did not fear death; but he was horror-stricken at the
thought of madness!Of losing that rational sense of the Ego which
constituted his normal individuality!Rosendo advised him to retire for the midday _siesta_.Through the
seemingly interminable afternoon he lay upon his hard bed with his
brain afire, while the events of his warped life moved before him in
spectral review.The week which had passed since he left Cartagena
seemed an age.When he might hope to receive word from the outside
world, he could not imagine.Even
should letters succeed in reaching Simiti for him, they must first
pass through the hands of the Alcalde.And what did the Alcalde know of him?And then, again, what did it
matter?He must not lose sight of the fact that his interest in the
outside world--nay, his interest in all things had ceased.He had yielded, after years of struggle, to pride, fear,
doubt.He had bowed before his morbid sense of honor--a perverted
sense, he now admitted, but still one which bound him in fetters of
steel.His life had been one of grossest inconsistency.He was utterly
out of tune with the universe.His incessant clash with the world of
people and events had sounded nothing but agonizing discord.And his
confusion of thought had become such that, were he asked why he was in
Simiti, he could scarcely have told.At length he dropped into a
feverish sleep.The day drew to a close, and the flaming sun rested for a brief moment
on the lofty tip of Tolima.Jose awoke, dripping with perspiration,
his steaming blood rushing wildly through its throbbing channels.Blindly he rose from his rough bed and stumbled out of the stifling
chamber.Who might be in the kitchen, he
did not stop to see.Dazed by the garish light and fierce heat, he
rushed from the house and over the burning shales toward the lake.What he intended to do, he knew not.His weltering thought held but a
single concept--water!The lake would cool his burning skin--he would
wade out into it until it rose to his cracking lips--he would lie down
in it, till it quenched the fire in his head--he would sleep in it--he
would never leave it--it was cool--perhaps cold!Was there aught in the world but fire--flames--fierce,
withering, smothering, consuming heat?He thought the shales crackled
as they melted beneath him!He thought his feet sank to the ankles in
molten lava, and were so heavy he scarce could drag them!He thought
the blazing sun shot out great tongues of flame, like the arms of a
monster devilfish, which twined about him, transforming his blood to
vapor and sucking it out through his gaping pores!A blinding light flashed before him as he reached the margin of the
lake.He clasped his head in
his hands--stumbled--and fell, face down, in the tepid waters.CHAPTER 2


"It was the little Carmen, Padre, who saw you run to the lake.She was
sitting at the kitchen door, studying her writing lesson."The priest essayed to rise from his bed.Night had fallen, and the
feeble light of the candle cast heavy shadows over the room, and made
grotesque pictures of the black, anxious faces looking in at the
grated window."But, Rosendo, it--was--a dream--a terrible dream!""_Na_, Padre, it was true, for I myself took you from the lake,"
replied Rosendo tenderly.Jose struggled to a sitting posture, but would have fallen back again
had not Rosendo's strong arm supported him.He passed his hand slowly
across his forehead, as if to brush the mental cobwebs from his
awakening brain.Then he inquired feebly:

"What does the doctor say?""Padre, there is no doctor in Simiti," Rosendo answered quietly.Then--

"But perhaps I do not need one."It did not happen to-day, Padre," said Rosendo with pitying
compassion.The priest stared at him uncomprehendingly.Then--

"The dreams were frightful!"There, Padre, think no more about it.You were wild--I fought to keep
you in bed--we thought you must die--all but Carmen--but you have your
senses now--and you must forget the past."Then his wild delirium had laid bare his soul!And
the man who had so faithfully nursed him through the crisis now
possessed the sordid details of this wretched life!Jose struggled to orient his undirected mind.A hot wave of anger
swept over him at the thought that he was still living, that his
battered soul had not torn itself from earth during his delirium and
taken flight.Was he fated to live forever, to drag out an endless
existence, with his heart written upon his sleeve for the world to
read and turn to its own advantage?Rosendo had stood between him and
death--but to what end?Had he not yet paid the score in full--good
measure, pressed down and running over?His thoughts ran rapidly from
one topic to another.He had
dreamed of her in that week of black night.He wondered if he had also
talked of her.He had lain at death's door--Rosendo had said so--but
he had had no physician.Perhaps these simple folk brewed their own
homely remedies--he wondered what they had employed in his case.Above
the welter of his thoughts this question pressed for answer."What medicine did you give me, Rosendo?"Jose's voice rose querulously in a little excess of excitement.You left me here without medical aid, to live or die, as might be?"The gentle Rosendo laid a soothing hand upon the priest's feverish
brow."_Na_, Padre,"--there was a hurt tone in the soft answer--"we
did all we could for you.But
we cared for you--and we prayed daily for your recovery.The little
Carmen said our prayers would be answered--and, you see, they were.""And what had she to do with my recovery?""_Quien sabe?_ It is sometimes that way when the little Carmen says
people shall not die.And then," he added sadly, "sometimes they do
die just the same.It is strange; we do not understand it."The gentle
soul sighed its perplexity."Did the child say I should not die?"he
asked softly, almost in a whisper."Yes, Padre; she says God's children do not die," returned Rosendo.The priest's blood stopped in its mad surge and slowly began to chill.What uncanny influence had he met with here
in this crumbling, forgotten town?He sought the index of his memory
for the sensations he had felt when he looked into the girl's eyes on
his first morning in Simiti.But memory reported back only impressions
of goodness--beauty--love.Then a dim light--only a feeble gleam--seemed to flash before him, but
at a great distance.Something called him--not by name, but by again
touching that unfamiliar chord which had vibrated in his soul when the
child had first stood before him.He felt a strange psychic
presentiment as of things soon to be revealed.A sentiment akin to awe
stole over him, as if he were standing in the presence of a great
mystery--a mystery so transcendental that the groveling minds of
mortals have never apprehended it.He turned again to the man sitting
beside his bed."Asleep, Padre," pointing to the other bed."But we must not wake
her," he admonished quickly, as the priest again sought to rise; "we
will talk of her to-morrow.I think--"

Rosendo stopped abruptly and looked at the priest as if he would
fathom the inmost nature of the man.Then he continued uncertainly:

"I--I may have some things to say to you to-morrow--if you are
well enough to hear them.But I will think about it to-night,
and--if--_Bien_!Rosendo rose slowly, as if weighted with heavy thoughts, and went out
into the living room.Presently he returned with a rude, homemade
broom and began to sweep a space on the dirt floor in the corner
opposite Jose.This done, he spread out a light straw mat for his
bed."The senora is preparing you a bowl of chicken broth and rice, Padre,"
he said."The little Carmen saved a hen for you when you should awake.She has fed it all the week on rice and goat's milk.She said she knew
you would wake up hungry."Jose's eyes had closely followed Rosendo's movements, although he
seemed not to hear his words."Rosendo," he cried, "have I your bed?And do you sleep there on the
floor?"Say nothing, Padre," replied Rosendo, gently forcing Jose back again
upon his bed."But--the senora, your wife--where does she sleep?""She has her _petate_ in the kitchen," was the quiet answer.Only the two poor beds, which were occupied by the priest and the
child!And Rosendo and his good wife had slept on the hard dirt floor
for a week!Jose's eyes dimmed when he realized the extent of their
unselfish hospitality.And would they continue to sleep thus on the
ground, with nothing beneath them but a thin straw mat, as long as he
might choose to remain with them?Aye, he knew that they would,
uncomplainingly.For these are the children of the "valley of the
pleasant 'yes.'"Jose awoke the next morning with a song echoing in his ears.He had
dreamed of singing; and as consciousness slowly returned, the
dream-song became real.It floated in from the living room on a clear,
sweet soprano.When a child he had heard such voices in the choir loft
of the great Seville cathedral, and he had thought that angels were
singing.As he lay now listening to it, memories of his childish
dreams swept over him in great waves.The soft, sweet cadences rose
and fell.His own heart swelled and pulsated with them, and his barren
soul once more surged under the impulse of a deep, potential desire to
manifest itself, its true self, unhampered at last by limitation and
convention, unfettered by superstition, human creeds and false
ambition.Then the inevitable reaction set in; a sickening sense of
the futility of his longing settled over him, and he turned his face
to the wall, while hot tears streamed over his sunken cheeks.Again through his wearied brain echoed the familiar admonition,
"Occupy till I come."Always the same invariable response to his
strained yearnings.The sweet voice in the adjoining room floated in
through the dusty palm door.It spread over his perturbed thought like
oil on troubled waters.At this
thought the sense of awe seemed to settle upon him again.A child--a
babe--had said that he should live!If a doctor had said it he would
have believed.But no; Rosendo
had said it; and there was no reason to doubt him.But what had this
child to do with it?Then
whence his sensations when first he saw her?Whence that feeling of
standing in the presence of a great mystery?"Out of the mouths of
babes and sucklings--" Foolishness!To be sure, the child may have
said he should not die; but if he were to live--which God forbid!--his
own recuperative powers would restore him.Rosendo's lively
imagination certainly had exaggerated the incident.Exhausted by his mental efforts, and lulled by the low singing, the
priest sank into fitful slumber.He was
standing alone in a great desert.Darkness encompassed him, and a
fearful loneliness froze his soul.Neither trees nor vegetation broke the dull monotony of the cheerless
scene.Nothing but waste, unutterably dreary waste, over which a chill
wind tossed the tinkling sand in fitful gusts.Again
he called, his heart sinking with despair.Then, over the desolate waste, through the heavy gloom, a voice seemed
borne faint on the cold air, "Occupy till I come!"His straining eyes caught the feeble glint of a light, but at
an immeasurable distance.Again he called; and again the same
response, but nearer.A glow began to suffuse the blackness about him.Nearer, ever nearer drew the gleam.Trees and vines sprang from the waste sand.As if in a
tremendous explosion, a dazzling light burst full upon him, shattering
the darkness, fusing the stones about him, and blinding his sight.He struggled to his feet; and as he
did so a loud voice cried, "Behold, I come _quickly_!""_Senor Padre_, you have been dreaming!"The priest, sitting upright and clutching at the rough sides of his
bed, stared with wooden obliviousness into the face of the little
Carmen.CHAPTER 3


"You are well now, aren't you, Padre?"It was not so much an interrogation as an affirmation, an assumption
of fact."Now you must come and see my garden--and Cucumbra, too.And
Cantar-las-horas; have you heard him?I scolded him lots; and I know
he wants to mind; but he just thinks he can't stop singing the
Vespers--the old stupid!"While the child prattled she drew a chair to the bedside and arranged
the bowl of broth and the two wheat rolls she had brought."You are real hungry, and you are going to eat all of this and get
strong again.she added, emphatically expressing her
confidence in the assumption.He seemed again to be trying to sound the
unfathomable depths of the child's brown eyes.Mechanically he took
the spoon she handed him.Madre
Ariza borrowed it from Dona Maria Alcozer.From his own great egoism, his years of heart-ache, sorrows, and
shames, the priest's heavy thought slowly lifted and centered upon the
child's beautiful face.The animated little figure before him radiated
such abundant life that he himself caught the infection; and with it
his sense of weakness passed like an illusion."Well, you know"--the enthusiastic little maid clambered up on the
bed--"yesterday it was Manuela--she was my hen.I told her a week ago
that you would need her--"

"And you gave up your hen for me, little one?"And she
clucked so hard, I knew she was glad to help the good _Cura_.You know,
things never do--do they?"To hide his confusion and gain time he began to
eat rapidly."No, they don't," said the girl confidently, answering her own
question."Because," she added, "God is _everywhere_--isn't He?"What manner of answer could he, of all men, make to such terribly
direct questions as these!And it was well that Carmen evidently
expected none--that in her great innocence she assumed for him the
same beautiful faith which she herself held."Dona Jacinta didn't die last week.But they said she did; and so they
took her to the cemetery and put her in a dark _boveda_.And the black
buzzards sat on the wall and watched them.Padre Rosendo said she had
gone to the angels--that God took her.But, Padre, God doesn't make
people sick, does He?They get sick because they don't know who He is.Every day I told God I knew He would cure you.While the girl paused for breath, her eyes sparkled, and her face
glowed with exaltation.Child-like, her active mind flew from one
topic to another, with no thought of connecting links."This morning, Padre, two little green parrots flew across the lake
and perched on our roof.And they sat there and watched Cucumbra eat
his breakfast; and they tried to steal his fish; and they scolded so
loud!Why did they want to steal from him, when there is so much to
eat everywhere?But they didn't know any better, did they?I don't
think parrots love each other very much, for they scold so hard.Padre, it is so dark in here; come out and see the sun and the lake
and the mountains.And my garden--Padre, it is beautiful!Esteban said
next time he went up the trail he would bring me a monkey for a pet;
and I am going to name it Hombrecito.And Captain Julio is going to
bring me a doll from down the river.But," with a merry, musical
trill, "Juan said the night you came that _you_ were my doll!And throwing back her little head, the child laughed
heartily."Padre, you must help padre Rosendo with his arithmetic.Every night
he puts on his big spectacles and works so hard to understand it.He
says he knows Satan made fractions.But, Padre, that isn't so, is it?Padre, you know _everything_, don't you?There are lots of things I want you to
tell me--such lots of things that nobody here knows anything about.Padre,"--the child leaned toward the priest and whispered low--"the
people here don't know who God is; and you are going to teach them!There was a _Cura_ here once, when I was a baby; but I guess he didn't
know God, either."She lapsed into silence, as if pondering this thought.Then, clapping
her hands with unfeigned joy, she cried in a shrill little voice, "Oh,
Padre, I am _so_ glad you have come to Simiti!I just _knew_ God would
not forget us!"His thought was busy with the phenomenon
before him: a child of man, but one who, like Israel of old, saw God
and heard His voice at every turn of her daily walk.Untutored in the
ways of men, without trace of sophistication or cant, unblemished as
she moved among the soiled vessels about her, shining with celestial
radiance in this unknown, moldering town so far from the world's
beaten paths.The door opened softly and Rosendo entered, preceded by a cheery
greeting._"Hombre!_" he exclaimed, surveying the priest, "but you mend fast!But I told the good wife that the little
Carmen would be better than medicine for you, and that you must have
her just as soon as you should awake."Absorbed in the child, he had
consumed almost his entire breakfast."He is well, padre Rosendo, he is well!"cried the girl, bounding up
and down and dancing about the tall form of her foster-father.Then,
darting to Jose, she seized his hand and cried, "Now to see my garden!commanded Rosendo, taking her by the arm."The good
_Cura_ is ill, and must rest for several days yet.""No, padre Rosendo, he is well--all well!appealing to Jose, and again urging him forth.The rapidity of the conversation and the animation of the beautiful
child caused complete forgetfulness of self, and, together with the
restorative effect of the wholesome food, acted upon the priest like a
magical tonic.Weak though he was, he clung to her hand and,
struggling out of the bed, stood uncertainly upon the floor.Instantly
Rosendo's arm was about him."Don't try it, Padre," the latter urged anxiously."The heat will be
too much for you.Another day or two of rest will make you right."But the priest, heedless of the admonition, suffered himself to be led
by the child; and together they passed slowly out into the living
room, through the kitchen, and thence into the diminutive rose garden,
the pride of the little Carmen.Dona Maria, wife of Rosendo, was bending over the primitive fireplace,
busy with her matutinal duties, having just dusted the ashes from a
corn _arepa_ which she had prepared for her consort's simple luncheon.She was a woman well into the autumn of life; but her form possessed
something of the elegance of the Spanish dames of the colonial period;
her countenance bore an expression of benevolence, which emanated
from a gentle and affectionate heart; and her manner combined both
dignity and suavity.She greeted the priest tenderly, and expressed
mingled surprise and joy that he felt able to leave his bed so soon.But as her eyes caught Rosendo's meaning glance, and then turned to
the child, they seemed to indicate a full comprehension of the
situation.The rose garden consisted of a few square feet of black earth,
bordered by bits of shale, and seemingly scarce able to furnish
nourishment for the three or four little bushes.But, though small,
these were blooming in profusion."Every night
he brings water from _La Cienaga_ for them!"Rosendo smiled patronizingly upon the child; but Jose saw in the
glance of his argus eyes a tenderness and depth of affection for her
which bespoke nothing short of adoration.Carmen bent over the roses, fondling and kissing them, and addressing
them endearing names."She calls them God's kisses," whispered Rosendo to the priest.At that moment a low growl was heard.Jose turned quickly and
confronted a gaunt dog, a wild breed, with eyes fixed upon the priest
and white fangs showing menacingly beneath a curling lip.cried the child, rushing to the beast and throwing her
arms about its shaggy neck."Haven't I told you to love everybody?And
is that the way to show it?Now kiss the _Cura's_ hand, for he loves
you."Then as she took the priest's hand and
held it to the dog's mouth, he licked it with his rough tongue.The priest's brain was now awhirl.He stood gazing at the child as if
fascinated.Through his jumbled thought there ran an insistent strain,
"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.The Father dwelleth in me
and I in Him."He did not associate these words with the Nazarene now,
but with the barefoot girl before him.Again within the farthest
depths of his soul he heard the soft note of a vibrating chord--that
chord which all the years of his unhappy life had hung mute, until
here, in this moldering town, in the wilderness of forgotten Guamoco,
the hand of Love had swept it.Dona Maria
summoned her little family to the midday repast.Rosendo brought a
chair for Jose and placed it near the rose garden in the shade of the
house, for, despite all protest, the priest had stubbornly refused to
return to his bed.Left now to himself, his thought hovered about the
child, and then drifted out across the incandescent shales to the
beautiful lake beyond.In the
distance the wooded <DW72>s of the San Lucas mountains rose like green
billows.It was Nature's hour
of _siesta_.In his own heart there was a great peace--and a strange
expectancy.He seemed to be awaiting a revelation of things close at
hand.In a way he felt that he had accomplished his purpose of coming
to Simiti to die, and that he was now awaiting the resurrection.The peaceful revery was interrupted by Rosendo."Padre, if you will
not return to your bed--" He regarded the priest dubiously.A long pause ensued, while Jose impatiently waited for Rosendo to
continue.He was eager to talk
of her, to learn her history, to see her, for her presence meant
complete obliteration of self."Padre," Rosendo at length emerged from his meditation."I would like
to speak of the little Carmen."Life and strength seemed to
return to him with a bound.Shall we visit the church, which is only across
the road?No one will be in
the streets during the heat."Let us go to the church, yes; but I can walk.Jose leaned upon Rosendo, the latter supporting him with his great
arm, and together they crossed the road and mounted the shale platform
on which stood the ancient edifice.Rosendo produced a huge key of
antique pattern; and the rusty lock, after much resistance, yielded
with a groan, and the heavy door creaked open, emitting an odor of
dampness and must.Doffing their hats, the men entered the long,
barn-like room.Rosendo carefully closed and locked the door behind
them, a precaution necessary in a drowsing town of this nature, where
the simple folk who see day after day pass without concern or event to
break the deadening monotony, assemble in eager, buzzing multitudes at
the slightest prospect of extraordinary interest.The room was dimly lighted, and was open to the peak of the roof.From
the rough-hewn rafters above hung hundreds of hideous bats.It was adorned with decrepit images, and held a
large wooden statue of the Virgin.This latter object was veiled with
two flimsy curtains, which were designed to be raised and lowered with
great pomp and the ringing of a little bell during service.The image
was attired in real clothes, covered with tawdry finery, gilt paper,
and faded ribbons.The head bore a wig of hair; and the face was
painted, although great sections of the paint had fallen, away,
leaving the suggestion of pockmarks.Beneath this image was located
the _sagrario_, the little cupboard in which the _hostia_, the sacred
wafer, was wont to be kept exposed in the _custodia_, a cheap
receptacle composed of two watch crystals.At either side of this
stood half consumed wax tapers.A few rough benches were strewn about
the floor; and dust and green mold lay thick over all.At the far right-hand corner of the building a lean-to had been
erected to serve as the _sacristia_, or vestry.In the worm-eaten
wardrobe within hung a few vestments, adorned with cheap finery, and
heavily laden with dust, over which scampered vermin of many
varieties.An air of desolation and abandon hung over the whole
church, and to Jose seemed to symbolize the decay of a sterile faith.Rosendo carefully dusted off a bench near one of the windows and bade
Jose be seated."_Padre_," he began, after some moments of deep reflection, "the
little Carmen is not an ordinary child.""I have seen that, Rosendo," interposed Jose."We--we do not understand her," Rosendo went on, carefully weighing
his words; "and we sometimes think she is not--not altogether like
us--that her coming was a miracle.But you do not believe in
miracles," he added quizzically."Why do you say that, Rosendo?""You were very sick, Padre; and in the fever you--" the impeccably
honest fellow hesitated."Yes, I thought so," said Jose with an air of weary resignation."And
what else did I say, Rosendo?"The faultless courtesy of the artless Rosendo, a courtesy so genuine
that Jose knew it came right from the heart, made conversation on this
topic a matter of extreme difficulty to him."Do not be uneasy, Padre," he said reassuringly.Whenever you began to talk I would not let others listen; and I stayed
with you every day and night.But--it is just because of what you said
in the _calentura_ that I am speaking to you now of the little
Carmen."Because of what he had said in his delirium!"Padre, many bad priests have been sent to Simiti.Priests who stirred up revolution elsewhere, who committed
murder, and ruined the lives of fair women, have been put upon us.And
when in Badillo I learned that you had been sent to our parish, I was
filled with fear.I--I lost a daughter, Padre--"

The good man hesitated again.Then, as a look of stern resolution
spread over his strong, dark face, he continued:

"It was Padre Diego!We drove him out of Simiti four years ago.But my
daughter, my only child, went with him."The great frame shook with
emotion, while he hurried on disconnectedly."Padre, the priest Diego said that the little Carmen should become a
Sister--a nun--that she must be sent to the convent in Mompox--that
she belonged to the Church, and the Church would some day have her.But, by the Holy Virgin, the Church shall _not_ have her!And I myself
will slay her before this altar rather than let such as Padre Diego
lay their slimy paws upon the angel child!"Rosendo leaped to his feet and began to pace the floor with great
strides.The marvelous frame of the man, in which beat a heart too big
for the sordid passions of the flesh, trembled as he walked.Jose
watched him in mute admiration, mingled with astonishment and a
heightened sense of expectancy.Presently Rosendo returned and seated
himself again beside the priest."Padre, I have lived in terror ever since Diego left Simiti.For
myself I do not fear, for if ever I meet with the wretch I shall wring
his neck with my naked hands!But--for the little Carmen--_Dios!_ they
might steal her at any time!There are men here who would do it for a
few _pesos_!I pray daily to the Virgin to
protect her.She--she is the light of my life.I neglect my _hacienda_, that I may guard her--and I am a poor
man, and cannot afford not to work."The man buried his face in his huge hands and groaned aloud.Jose
remained pityingly silent, knowing that Rosendo's heaving heart must
empty itself."Padre," Rosendo at length raised his head.His features were drawn,
but his eyes glowed fiercely."Priests have committed dark deeds here,
and this altar has dripped with blood.When a child, with my own eyes
I saw a priest elevate the Host before this altar, as the people knelt
in adoration.While their heads were bowed I saw him drive a knife
into the neck of a man who was his enemy; and the blood spurted over
the image of the Virgin and fell upon the Sacred Host itself!And
what did the wicked priest say in defense?Simply that he took this
time to assassinate his man because then the victim could die adoring
the Host and under the most favorable circumstances for salvation!_Hombre!_ And did the priest pay the penalty for his crime?The
Bishop of Cartagena transferred him to another parish, and told him to
do better in future!""And I remember the story my father used to tell of the priest who
poisoned a whole family in Simiti with the communion wafer.Their
estates had been willed to the Church, and he was impatient to have
the management of them."But, Rosendo, if Simiti has been so afflicted by bad priests, why are
you confiding in me?""Because, Padre," Rosendo replied, "in the fever you said many things
that made me think you were not a bad man.I did suspect you at
first--but not after I heard you talk in your sleep.No, not God; but the men who
say they know what He thinks and says.And
after I heard you tell those things in your fever-sleep, I said to
Maria that if you lived I knew you would help me protect the little
Carmen.Then, too, you are a--" He lapsed abruptly into silence.You have said she is
not your daughter.I ask only because of sincere affection for you
all, and because the child has aroused in me an unwonted interest."Rosendo looked steadily into the eyes of the priest for some moments.From the eyes of the one there
emanated a soul-searching scrutiny; from those of the other an
answering bid for confidence."Padre," began Rosendo, "I place trust in you.Something makes me
believe that you are not like other priests I have known.And I have
seen that you already love the little Carmen.One day, about eight years ago, a steamer on its way down the river
touched at Badillo to put off a young woman, who was so sick that the
captain feared she would die on board.He knew nothing of her, except
that she had embarked at Honda and was bound for Barranquilla.He
hoped that by leaving her in the care of the good people of Badillo
something might be done.The boat went its way; and the next morning
the woman died, shortly after her babe was born.They buried her back
of the village, and Escolastico's woman took the child.They tried to
learn the history of the mother; but, though the captain of the boat
made many inquiries, he could only find that she had come from Bogota
the day before the boat left Honda, and that she was then very sick.Some weeks afterward Escolastico happened to come to Simiti, and told
me the story.He complained that his family was already large, and
that his woman found the care of the babe a burden.I love children,
Padre, and it seemed to me that I could find a place for the little
one, and I told him I would fetch her.And so a few days later I
brought her to Simiti.But before leaving Badillo I fixed a wooden
cross over the mother's grave and wrote on it in pencil the name
'_Dolores_,' for that was the name in the little gold locket which we
found in her valise.There were some clothes, better than the average,
and the locket.In the locket were two small pictures, one of a young
man, with the name '_Guillermo_' written beneath it, and one of the
woman, with '_Dolores_' under it.Captain Julio took the
locket to Honda when he made inquiries there; but brought it back
again, saying that nobody recognized the faces.I named the babe
Carmen, and have brought her up as my own child.She--Padre, I adore
her!""But we sometimes think," said Rosendo, resuming his dramatic
narrative, "that it was all a miracle, perhaps a dream; that it was
the angels who left the babe on the river bank, for she herself is not
of the earth.""Tell me, Rosendo, just what you mean," said Jose reverently, laying
his hand gently upon the older man's arm."Talk with her, Padre, and you will
see.She is like--"

His voice dropped to a whisper.

"And she knows Him better than she knows me."The gloom within the musty
church was thick; and the bats stirred restlessly among the dusty
rafters overhead.Outside, the relentless heat poured down upon the
deserted streets."In the _calentura_ you talked of wonderful
things.You spoke of kings and popes and foreign lands, of beautiful
cities and great marvels of which we know nothing.And you recited beautiful poems--but often in other tongues than ours.I listened, and was astonished, for
we are so ignorant here in Simiti, oh, so ignorant!We have no
schools, and our poor little children grow up to be only _peones_ and
fishermen.But--the little Carmen--ah, she has a mind!Padre--"

Again he lapsed into silence, as if fearful to ask the boon."Yes, Rosendo, yes," Jose eagerly reassured him.Rosendo turned full upon the priest and spoke rapidly."Padre, will
you teach the little Carmen what you know?Will you make her a strong,
learned woman, and fit her to do big things in the world--and
then--then--"

"Yes, Rosendo?""--then get her away from Simiti?his voice sank to a hoarse whisper--"will you help me keep her
from the Church?"Jose sat staring at the man with dilating eyes."Padre, she has her own Church.He leaned over and laid a hand upon the priest's knee.His dark eyes
seemed to burn like glowing coals.His whispered words were fraught
with a meaning which Jose would some day learn."Padre, _that_ must be left alone!"A long silence fell upon the two men, the one massive of frame and
black of face, but with a mind as simple as a child's and a heart as
white as the snow that sprinkled his raven locks--the other a
youth in years, but bowed with disappointment and suffering; yet now
listening with hushed breath to the words that rolled with a mighty
reverberation through the chambers of his soul:

"I am God, and there is none else!Arise,
shine, for thy light is come!"The sweet face of the child rose out of the gloom before the priest.The years rolled back like a curtain, and he saw himself at her tender
age, a white, unformed soul, awaiting the sculptor's hand.God forbid
that the hand which shaped his career should form the plastic mind of
this girl!Of a sudden a great thought flashed out of the depths of eternity and
into his brain, a thought which seemed to illumine his whole past
life.In the clear light thereof he seemed instantly to read meanings
in numberless events which to that hour had remained hidden.His
complex, misshapen career--could it have been a preparation?--and for
this?He had yearned to serve his fellow-men, but had miserably
failed.For, while to will was always present with him, even as with
Paul, yet how to perform that which was good he found not.But
now--what an opportunity opened before him!What a beautiful offering
of self was here made possible?Rosendo sat stolid, buried in thought.Jose reached out through the
dim light and grasped his black hand.His eyes were lucent, his heart
burned with the fire of an unknown enthusiasm, and speech stumbled
across his lips."Rosendo, I came to Simiti to die.And now I know that I _shall_
die--to myself.And here
before this altar, in the sight of that God whom she knows so well, I
pledge my new-found life to Carmen.My mind, my thought, my strength,
are henceforth hers.May her God direct me in their right use for His
beautiful child!"Jose and Rosendo rose from the bench with hands still clasped.In that
hour the priest was born again.CHAPTER 4


"He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."The reporters of the unique Man of Galilee, upon whose straining ears
these words fell, noted them for future generations of footsore
pilgrims on life's wandering highway--for the rich, satiated with
their gorgeous gluttonies; for the proud Levite, with his feet
enmeshed in the lifeless letter of the Law; for the loathsome and
outcast beggar at the gates of Dives.And for Jose de Rincon, priest
of the Holy Catholic Church and vicar of Christ, scion of aristocracy
and worldly learning, now humbled and blinded, like Paul on the road
to Damascus, begging that his spiritual sight might be opened to the
glory of the One with whom he had not known how to walk.Returning in silence from the church to Rosendo's humble cottage, Jose
had asked leave to retire.He would be alone with the great Presence
which had come to him across the desert of his life, and now stood
before him in the brightness of the undimmed sun.Indeed, quite the contrary; a quickened sense of
life, an eagerness to embrace the opportunity opening before him,
caused his chest to heave and his shrunken veins to throb.On his bed in the darkened room he lay in a deep silence, broken only
at intervals by the hurried scampering of lizards darting through the
interstices of the dry walls.His uncomprehending eyes were fixed upon
the dust-laden thatch of the roof overhead, where droning wasps toiled
upon their frail abodes.He lay with the portals of his mind opened
wide.Through them, in ceaseless flow, passed two streams which did
not mingle.The one, outward bound, turbid with its burden of egoism,
fear, perplexity, and hopelessness, which, like barnacles, had
fastened to his soul on its chartless voyage; the other, a stream of
hope and confidence and definite purpose, a stream which leaped and
sang in the warm sunlight of Love as it poured into his receptive
brain.The fresh thought which flowed into his mental chambers rapidly formed
into orderly plans, all centering upon the child, Carmen.The relative truths and worldly knowledge--purified,
as far as in him lay, from the dross of speculation and human
opinion--which lay stored in the archives of his mind?History, and its interpretation of human progress; the
languages; mathematics, and the elements of the physical sciences;
literature; and a knowledge of people and places.With these his
retentive mind was replete.And her tutor, he now knew, was the Master Mind, omniscient God.And he knew, more, that she possessed secrets whose potency he might
as yet scarcely imagine.For, in an environment which for dearth of
mental stimulus and incentive could scarcely be matched; amid
poverty but slightly raised above actual want; untouched by the
temperamental hopelessness which lies just beneath the surface of
these dull, simple folk, this child lived a life of such ecstasy as
might well excite the envy of the world's potentates.But meantime, what should be his attitude toward the parish?He fully
realized that he and the Church were now as far apart as the poles.Yet this was become his parish, the first he had ever held; and these
were his people.And he must face them and preach--what?If not the
Catholic faith, then would he be speedily removed.And that meant
complete disruption of his rapidly formulating plans.But might he not
in that event flee with Carmen, renounce the Church, and--

Impossible!Excommunication alone could sever the oath by which the
Church held him.And for that he could not say that he was ready.For
excommunication meant disgrace to his mother--perhaps the snapping of
a heart already sorely strained.To
preach the Catholic faith without sincerity was scarcely less.Yet
amid present circumstances this seemed the only course open to him.But what must he teach Carmen in regard to the Church?Could he
maintain his position in it, yet not of it; and at the same time rear
her without its pale, yet so as not to conflict with the people of
Simiti, nor cause such comment as might reach the ears of the Bishop
of Cartagena?And if it was God's plan, he might safely trust Him
for the requisite strength and wisdom.For this course the isolation
of Simiti and the childish simplicity of its people afforded a
tremendous advantage.On the other hand, he knew that both he and
Carmen had powerful enemies.Yet, one with God might rout a host.Thus throughout the afternoon the priest weighed and pondered the
thoughts that sought admission to his reawakened mind.He was not
interrupted until sundown; and then Carmen entered the room with a
bowl of chocolate and some small wheaten loaves.Behind her, with an
amusing show of dignity, stalked a large heron, an elegant bird, with
long, scarlet legs, gray plumage, and a gracefully curved neck.When
the bird reached the threshold it stopped, and without warning gave
vent to a prolonged series of shrill, unmusical sounds.The startled
priest sat up in his bed and exclaimed in amazement."It is only Cantar-las-horas, Padre," laughed the little maid."He
follows me wherever I go, unless he is off fishing.Sometimes when I
go out in the boat with padre Rosendo he flies clear across the lake
to meet us.He is lots older than I, and years ago, when there were
_Curas_ here, he learned his song.Whenever the _Angelas_ rang he
would try to sing just like it; and now he has the habit and can't
help it.But he is such a dear, wise old fellow," twining a chubby arm
lovingly about the bird's slender neck; "and he always sings just at
six o'clock, the time the _Angelas_ used to ring."The heron manifested the deepest affection for the child as she gently
stroked its plumage and caressed its long, pointed bill."But how do you suppose he knows when it is just six o'clock,
_chiquita_?"asked Jose, deeply interested in the strange phenomenon."God tells him, Padre," was the direct and simple reply.Assuredly, he should have known that!But he was fast learning of this
unusual child, whose every movement was a demonstration of Immanuel."Does God tell you what to do, Carmen?"he asked, seeking to draw out
the girl's strange thought, that he might probe deeper into her
religious convictions."Doesn't He tell you,
too?"He was a _Cura_; he should be very
close to God."Yes, _chiquita_--that is, He has told me to-day what to do."There was a shade of disappointment in her voice when she replied: "I
guess you mean you listened to Him to-day, don't you, Padre?I think
sometimes you don't want to hear Him.But," she finished with a little
sigh, "there are lots of people here who don't; and that is why they
are sick and unhappy."Jose was learning another lesson, that of guarding his speech to this
ingenuous girl."What have you been doing this afternoon, little one?"Her eyes instantly brightened, and the dark shade that had crossed her
face disappeared."Well, after the _siesta_ I helped madre Maria clean the yuccas for
supper; and then I did my writing lesson.Padre Rosendo told me to-day
that I could write better than he.But, Padre, will you teach madre
Maria to read and write?And there are just lots of poor people here
who can't, too.There is a school teacher in Simiti, but he charges a
whole _peso oro_ a month for teaching; and the people haven't the
money, and so they can't learn."Always the child shifted his thought from herself to others.Again she
showed him that the road to happiness wound among the needs of his
fellow-men.The priest mentally recorded the instruction; and the girl
continued:

"Padre Rosendo told madre Maria that you said you had come to Simiti
to die.You were not thinking of us then, were you, Padre?People who
think only of themselves always want to die.That was why Don Luis
died last year.He had lots of gold, and he always wanted more, and he
was cruel and selfish, and he couldn't talk about anything but himself
and how rich he was--and so he died.He didn't really die; but he
thought about himself until he thought he died.That's what always happens to people who think about themselves
all the time--they get buried."Jose was glad of the silence that fell upon them.Wrapped so long in
his own egoism, he had now no worldly wisdom with which to match this
girl's sapient words.He felt that Carmen was but the
channel through which a great Voice was speaking."Padre," the tones were tender and soft, "you don't always think of
good things, do you?"But--"

"Because if you had you wouldn't have been driven into the lake that
day.And you wouldn't be here now in Simiti.""But, child, even a _Cura_ cannot always think of good things, when he
sees so much wickedness in the world!""But, Padre, God is good, isn't He?""Then where is the wickedness, Padre?""Why--but, _chiquita_, you don't understand; you are too young to
reason about such things; and--"

In his heart Jose knew he spoke not the truth.He felt the great
brown eyes of the girl penetrate his naked soul; and he knew that in
the dark recesses of the inner man they fell upon the grinning
skeleton of hypocrisy.Carmen might be, doubtless was, incapable of
reasoning.But by what crass
assumption might he, admittedly woefully defeated in his combat with
Fate, oppose his feeble shafts of worldly logic to this child's
instinct, an instinct of whose inerrancy her daily walk was a living
demonstration?In quick penitence and humility he stretched out his
arm and drew her unresisting to him."Dear little child of God," he murmured, as he bent over her and
touched his lips to her rich brown curls, "I have tried my life long
to learn what you already know.And at last I have been led to you--to
you, little one, who shall be a lamp unto my feet.Dearest child, I
want to know your God as you know Him.I want you to lead me to Him,
for you know where He is.""He is _everywhere_, Padre dear," whispered the child, as she
nestled close to the priest and stole her soft arms gently about his
neck."But we don't see Him nor hear Him if we have bad thoughts, and
if we don't love everybody and everything, even Cucumbra, and
Cantar-las-horas, and--"

"Yes, _chiquita_, I know now," interrupted Jose."I don't wonder they
all love you.""But, Padre dear, I love them--and I love you."first of the tender graces which adorned this beautiful child.Verily, only those imbued with it become the real teachers of men.The
beloved disciple's last instruction to his dear children was the
tender admonition to love one another.But why, oh, why are we bidden
to love the fallen, sordid outcasts of this wicked world--the
wretched, sinning pariahs--the greedy, grasping, self-centered mass of
humanity that surges about us in such woeful confusion of good and
evil?Because he taught that he who loves not, knows not God.And because,
oh, wonderful spiritual alchemy!because Love is the magical potion
which, dropping like heavenly dew upon sinful humanity, dissolves the
vice, the sorrow, the carnal passions, and transmutes the brutish
mortal into the image and likeness of the perfect God.Far into the night, while the child slept peacefully in the bed near
him, Jose lay thinking of her and of the sharp turn which she had
given to the direction of his life.Through the warm night air the
hoarse croaking of distant frogs and the mournful note of the toucan
floated to his ears.In the street without he heard at intervals the
pattering of bare feet in the hot, thick dust, as tardy fishermen
returned from their labors.The hum of insects about his _toldo_
lulled him with its low monotone.The call of a lonely jaguar drifted
across the still lake from the brooding jungle beyond.A great peace
lay over the ancient town; and when, in the early hours of morning, as
the distorted moon hung low in the western sky, Jose awoke, the soft
breathing of the child fell upon his ears like a benediction; and deep
from his heart there welled a prayer--

"My God--_her_ God--at last I thank Thee!"CHAPTER 5


The day following was filled to the brim with bustling activity.Jose
plunged into his new life with an enthusiasm he had never known
before.His first care was to relieve Rosendo and his good wife of the
burden of housing him.Rosendo, protesting against the intimation that
the priest could in any way inconvenience him, at last suggested that
the house adjoining his own, a small, three-room cottage, was vacant,
and might be had at a nominal rental.Some repairs were needed; the
mud had fallen from the walls in several places; but he would plaster
it up again and put it into habitable condition at once.During the discussion Don Mario, the Alcalde, called to pay his
respects to Jose.He had just returned from a week's visit to Ocana,
whither he had gone on matters of business with Simiti's most eminent
citizen, Don Felipe Alcozer, who was at present sojourning there for
reasons of health.Learning of the priest's recent severe illness, Don
Mario had hastened at once to pay his _devoirs_.And now the Holy
Virgin be praised that he beheld the _Cura_ again fully restored!Yes,
the dismal little house in question belonged to him, but would the
_Cura_ graciously accept it, rent free, and with his most sincere
compliments?Jose glanced at Rosendo and, reading a meaning in the
slight shake of his head, replied that, although overwhelmed by the
Alcalde's kindness, he could take the cottage only on the condition
that it should become the parish house, which the Church must support.A shade of disappointment seemed to cross the heavy face of Don Mario,
but he graciously acquiesced in the priest's suggestion; and
arrangements were at once concluded whereby the house became the
dwelling place of the new _Cura_.Rosendo thereupon sent out a call for assistants, to which the entire
unemployed male population of the town responded.Mud for the walls
was hastily brought from the lake, and mixed with manure and dried
grass.A half dozen young men started for the islands to cut fresh
thatch for the roof.Others set about scraping the hard dirt floors;
while Don Mario gave orders which secured a table, several rough
chairs, together with iron stewpans and a variety of enameled metal
dishes, all of which Rosendo insisted should be charged against the
parish.The village carpenter, with his rusty tools and rough,
undressed lumber, constructed a bed in one of the rooms; and Juan, the
boatman, laboriously sought out stones of the proper shape and size to
support the cooking utensils in the primitive dirt hearth.Often, as he watched the progress of these arrangements, Jose's
thoughts reverted longingly to his father's comfortable house in
far-off Seville; to his former simple quarters in Rome; and to the
less pretentious, but still wholly sufficient _menage_ of Cartagena.Compared with this primitive dwelling and the simple husbandry which
it would shelter, his former abodes and manner of life had been
extravagantly luxurious.At times he felt a sudden sinking of heart as
he reflected that perhaps he should never again know anything better
than the lowly life of this dead town.But when his gaze rested upon
the little Carmen, flying hither and yon with an ardent, anticipatory
interest in every detail of the preparations, and when he realized
that, though her feet seemed to rest in the squalid setting afforded
by this dreary place, yet her thought dwelt ever in heaven, his heart
welled again with a great thankfulness for the inestimable privilege
of giving his new life, in whatever environment, to a soul so fair as
hers.While his house was being set in order under the direction of Rosendo,
Jose visited the church with the Alcalde to formulate plans for its
immediate repair and renovation.As he surveyed the ancient pile and
reflected that it stood as a monument to the inflexible religious
convictions of his own distant progenitors, the priest's sensibilities
were profoundly stirred.How little he knew of that long line of
illustrious ancestry which preceded him!He had been thrust from under
the parental wing at the tender age of twelve; but he could not recall
that even before that event his father had ever made more than casual
mention of the family.Indeed, in the few months since arriving on
ancestral soil Jose had gathered up more of the threads which bound
him to the ancient house of Rincon than in all the years which
preceded.Had he himself only been capable of the unquestioning
acceptance of religious dogma which those old _Conqueros_ and early
forbears exhibited, to what position of eminence in Holy Church might
he not already have attained, with every avenue open to still greater
preferment!How glorious their
honored name!--

With a sigh the priest roused himself and strove to thrust these
disturbing thoughts from his mind by centering his attention upon the
work in hand.Dona Maria came to him for permission to take the moldy
vestments from the _sacristia_ to her house to clean them.The
Alcalde, bustling about, panting and perspiring, was distributing
countless orders among his willing assistants.Carmen, who throughout
the morning had been everywhere, bubbling with enthusiasm, now
appeared at the church door.As she entered the musty, ill-smelling
old building she hesitated on the threshold, her childish face screwed
into an expression of disgust."Come in, little one; I need your inspiration," called Jose cheerily.The child approached, and slipped her hand into his."Padre Rosendo
says this is God's house," she commented, looking up at Jose."He says
you are going to talk about God here--in this dirty, smelly old place!Why don't you talk about Him out of doors?"Jose was becoming innured to the embarrassment which her direct
questions occasioned.And he was learning not to dissemble in his
replies."It is because the people want to come here, dear one; it is their
custom."Would the people believe that the wafer and wine could be changed into
the flesh and blood of Jesus elsewhere--even in Nature's temple?"But _I_ don't want to come here!""That was a naughty thing to say to the good _Cura_, child!"interposed Don Mario, who had overheard the girl's remark."You see,
Padre, how we need a _Cura_ here to save these children; otherwise the
Church is going to lose them.They are running pretty wild, and
especially this one.She is already dedicated to the Church; but she
will have to learn to speak more reverently of holy things if she
expects to become a good Sister."The child looked uncomprehendingly from, one to the other."Oh, Padre Diego, at her baptism, when she was a baby," replied Don
Mario in a matter of fact tone.Jose shuddered at the thought of that unholy man's loathsome hands
resting upon the innocent girl.Of
all things, he knew that the guarding of his own tongue was now most
important.But his thought was busy with Rosendo's burning words of
the preceding day, and with his own solemn vow.He reflected on his
present paradoxical, hazardous position; on the tremendous problem
which here confronted him; and on his desperate need of wisdom--yea,
superhuman wisdom--to ward off from this child the net which he knew
the subtlety and cruel cunning of shrewd, unscrupulous men would some
day cause to be cast about her.A soul like hers, mirrored in a body
so wondrous fair, must eventually draw the devil's most envenomed
barbs.To Jose's great relief Don Mario turned immediately from the present
topic to one relating to the work of renovation.Finding a pretext for
sending Carmen back to the house, the priest gave his attention
unreservedly to the Alcalde.But his mind ceased not to revolve the
implications in Don Mario's words relative to the girl; and when the
midday _siesta_ came upon him his brow was knotted and his eyes gazed
vacantly at the manifestations of activity about him.Hurrying across the road to escape the scalding heat, Jose's ears
again caught the sound of singing, issuing evidently from Rosendo's
house.It was very like the clear, sweet voice which had floated into
his room the morning after he awoke from his delirium.He approached
the door reverently and looked in.Carmen was arranging the few poor
dishes upon the rough table, and as she worked, her soul flowed across
her lips in song.The words and the simple melody which
carried them were evidently an improvisation.But the voice--did that
issue from a human throat?Yes, for in distant Spain and far-off Rome,
in great cathedrals and concert halls, he had sometimes listened
entranced to voices like this--stronger, and delicately trained, but
reared upon even less of primitive talent.The girl caught sight of him; and the song died on the warm air.The priest strode toward her and clasped her in his arms."And I suppose He tells you when to sing, too, as He does
Cantar-las-horas?""No, Padre," was the unaffected answer.The man felt rebuked for his light remark; and a lump rose in his
throat.He looked again into her fair face with a deep yearning.Did you but know--could you but realize--that
the kingdom of heaven is within you, would not celestial melody flow
from your lips, too?Throughout the afternoon, while he labored with his willing helpers in
the church building and his homely cottage, the child's song lingered
in his brain, like the memory of a sweet perfume.His eyes followed
her lithe, graceful form as she flitted about, and his mind was busy
devising pretexts for keeping her near him.At times she would steal
up close to him and put her little hand lovingly and confidingly into
his own.Then as he looked down into her upturned face, wreathed with
smiles of happiness, his breath would catch, and he would turn
hurriedly away, that she might not see the tears which suffused his
eyes.When night crept down, unheralded, from the _Sierras_, the priest's
house stood ready for its occupant.Cantar-las-horas had dedicated it
by singing the _Angelus_ at the front door, for the hour of six had
overtaken him as he stood, with cocked head, peering curiously within.The dwelling, though pitifully bare, was nevertheless as clean as
these humble folk with the primitive means at their command could
render it.Instead of the customary hard _macana_ palm strips for the
bed, Rosendo had thoughtfully substituted a large piece of tough white
canvas, fastened to a rectangular frame, which rested on posts well
above the damp floor.On this lay a white sheet and a light blanket of
red flannel.Rosendo had insisted that, for the present, Jose should
take his meals with him.The priest's domestic arrangements,
therefore, would be simple in the extreme; and Dona Maria quietly
announced that these were in her charge.The church edifice would not
be in order for some days yet, perhaps a week.But of this Jose was
secretly glad, for he regarded with dread the necessity of discharging
the priestly functions.And yet, upon that hinged his stay in Simiti."Simiti has two churches, you know, Padre," remarked Rosendo during
the evening meal."There is another old one near the eastern edge of
town.If you wish, we can visit it while there is yet light."Jose expressed his pleasure; and a few minutes later the two men, with
Carmen dancing along happily beside them, were climbing the shaly
eminence upon the summit of which stood the second church.On the way
they passed the town cemetery."The Spanish cemetery never grows," commented Jose, stopping at the
crumbling gateway and peering in.The place of sepulture was the
epitome of utter desolation.A tumbled brick wall surrounded it, and
there were a few broken brick vaults, in some of which whitening bones
were visible.In a far corner was a heap of human bones and bits of
decayed coffins."Their rent fell due, Padre," said Rosendo with a little laugh,
indicating the bones."The Church rents this ground to the people--it
is consecrated, you know.And if the payments are not made, why, the
bones come up and are thrown over there.""But you see, Padre, the Church is only concerned with souls.And it
is better to pay the money to get souls out of purgatory than to rent
a bit of ground for the body, is it not?""Come, Padre," continued Rosendo."I would not want to have to spend
the night here.For, you know, if a man spends a night in a cemetery
an evil spirit settles upon him--is it not so?"Jose still kept silence before the old man's inbred superstition.A
few minutes later they stood before the old church.It was in the
Spanish mission style, but smaller than the one in the central
_plaza_."This was built in the time of your great-grandfather, Padre, the
father of Don Ignacio," offered Rosendo."The Rincon family had many
powerful enemies throughout the country, and those in Simiti even
carried their ill feeling so far as to refuse to hear Mass in the
church which your family built.Strange noises are sometimes heard inside, and the
people are afraid to go in.You see there are no houses built near it.They say an angel of the devil lives here and thrashes around at times
in terrible anger.There is a story that many years ago, when I was
but a baby, the devil's angel came and entered this church one dark
night, when there was a terrible storm and the waves of the lake were
so strong that they tossed the crocodiles far up on the shore.And
when the bad angel saw the candles burning on the altar before the
sacred wafer he roared in anger and blew them out.But there was a
beautiful painting of the Virgin on the wall, and when the lights went
out she came down out of her picture and lighted the candles again.But the devil's angel blew them out once more.And then, they say, the
Holy Virgin left the church in darkness and went out and locked the
wicked angel in, where he has been ever since.That was to show her
displeasure against the enemies of the great Rincons for erecting this
church.The _Cura_ died suddenly that night; and the church has never
been used since The Virgin, you know, is the special guardian Saint of
the Rincon family.""But you do not believe the story, Rosendo?""_Quien sabe?_" was the noncommittal reply."Do you really think the Virgin could or would do such a thing,
Rosendo?"She has the same power as God, has she not?The frame
which held her picture"--reverting again to the story--"was found out
in front of the church the next morning; but the picture itself was
gone."Jose glanced down at Carmen, who had been listening with a tense, rapt
expression on her face.What impression did this strange story make
upon her?She looked up at the priest with a little laugh."Let us go in, Padre," she said."I--I would--rather not," the old man replied hesitatingly.Physical danger was temperamental to this noble
son of the jungle; yet the religious superstition which Spain had
bequeathed to this oppressed land still shackled his limbs.As they descended the hill Carmen seized an opportunity to speak to
Jose alone."Some day, Padre," she whispered, "you and I will open the
door and let the bad angel out, won't we?"He knew that the door of his own mind
had swung wide at her bidding in these few days, and many a bad angel
had gone out forever.CHAPTER 6


The dawn of a new day broke white and glistering upon the ancient
_pueblo_.From their hard beds of palm, and their straw mats on the
dirt floors, the provincial dwellers in this abandoned treasure house
of Old Spain rose already dressed to resume the monotonous routine of
their lowly life.The duties which confronted them were few, scarce
extending beyond the procurement of their simple food.And for all,
excepting the two or three families which constituted the shabby
aristocracy of Simiti, this was limited in the extreme.Indian corn,
_panela_, and coffee, with an occasional addition of _platanos_ or
rice, and now and then bits of _bagre_, the coarse fish yielded by the
adjacent lake, constituted the staple diet of the average citizen of
this decayed hamlet.A few might purchase a bit of lard at rare
intervals; and this they hoarded like precious jewels.Some
occasionally had wheat flour; but the long, difficult transportation,
and its rapid deterioration in that hot, moist climate, where swarms
of voracious insects burrow into everything not cased in tin or iron,
made its cost all but prohibitive.And the latter even exceeded in value the black, naked
babes that played in the hot dust of the streets with them.Standing in the warm, unadulterated sunlight in
his doorway he watched the village awaken.At a door across the
_plaza_ a woman appeared, smoking a cigar, with the lighted end in her
mouth.Jose viewed with astonishment this curious custom which
prevails in the _Tierra Caliente_.He had observed that in Simiti
nearly everybody of both sexes was addicted to the use of tobacco, and
it was no uncommon sight to see children of tender age smoking heavy,
black cigars with keen enjoyment.From another door issued two
fishermen, who, seeing the priest, approached and asked his blessing
on their day's work.Some moments later he heard a loud tattoo, and
soon the Alcalde of the village appeared, marching pompously through
the streets, preceded by his tall, black secretary, who was beating
lustily upon a small drum.At each street intersection the little
procession halted, while the Alcalde with great impressiveness
sonorously read a proclamation just received from the central
Government at Bogota to the effect that thereafter no cattle might be
killed in the country without the payment of a tax as therein set
forth.Groups of _peones_ gathered slowly about the few little stores
in the main street, or entered and inspected for the thousandth time
the shabby stocks.Matrons with black, shining faces cheerily greeted
one another from their doorways.Everywhere prevailed a gentle decorum
of speech and manners.For, however lowly the station, however pinched
the environment, the dwellers in this ancient town were ever gentle,
courteous and dignified.Their conversation dealt with the simple
affairs of their quiet life.They knew nothing of the complex
problems, social, economic, or religious, which harassed their
brethren of the North.No dubious aspirations or ambitions stirred
their breasts.Nothing of the frenzied greed and lust of material
accumulation touched their child-like minds.They dwelt upon a plane
far, far removed, in whatever direction, from the mental state of
their educated and civilized brothers of the great States, who from
time to time undertake to advise them how to live, while ruthlessly
exploiting them for material gain.And thus they have been exploited
ever since the heavy hand of the Spaniard was laid upon them, four
centuries ago.Thus they will continue to be, until that distant day
when mankind shall have learned to find their own in another's good.As his eyes swept his environment, the untutored folk, the old church,
the dismally decrepit mud houses, with an air of desolation and utter
abandon brooding over all; and as he reflected that his own complex
nature, rather than any special malice of fortune, had brought this to
him, Jose's heart began to sink under the sting of a condemning
conscience.Its pitiful emptiness smote
him sore.No books, no pictures, no furnishings, nothing that
ministers to the comfort of a civilized and educated man!And yet,
amid this barrenness he had resolved to live.A song drifted to him through the pulsing heat of the morning air.It
sifted through the mud walls of his poor dwelling, and poured into the
open doorway, where it hovered, quivering, like the dust motes in the
sunbeams.It was Carmen, the child
to whom his life now belonged.Resolutely he again set his wandering
mind toward the great thing he would accomplish--the protection and
training of this girl, even while, if might be, he found his life
again in hers.Nothing on earth should shake him from that purpose!Doubt and uncertainty were powerless to dull the edge of his efforts.His bridges were burned behind him; and on the other side of the great
gulf lay the dead self which he had abandoned forever.A harsh medley of loud, angry growls, interspersed with shrill yelps,
suddenly arose before his house, and Jose hastened to the door just in
time to see Carmen rush into the street and fearlessly throw herself
upon two fighting dogs.she exclaimed, dragging the angry brute
from a thoroughly frightened puppy.And after all I've talked to you about loving that
puppy!"The gaunt animal slunk down, with its tail between its legs."Did you ever gain anything at all by fighting?And right down in your heart you know you love that puppy.You've
_got_ to love him; you can't help it!And you might as well begin
right now."The beast whimpered at her little bare feet."Cucumbra, you let bad thoughts use you, didn't you?Yes, you did; and
you're sorry for it now.Well, there's the puppy," pointing to the
little dog, which stood hesitant some yards away."Now go and play
with him," she urged.rousing the larger dog and
pointing toward the puppy.Cucumbra hesitated, looking alternately at the small, resolute girl
and the smaller dog.Her arm remained rigidly extended, and
determination was written large in her set features.The puppy uttered
a sharp bark, as if in forgiveness, and began to scamper playfully
about.Cucumbra threw a final glance at the girl.The large dog bounded after the puppy, and together they disappeared
around the street corner.The child turned and saw Jose, who had regarded the scene in mute
astonishment."_Muy buenos dias, Senor Padre_," dropping a little courtesy."But
isn't Cucumbra foolish to have bad thoughts?""Why, yes--he certainly is," replied Jose slowly, hard pressed by the
unusual question."He has just _got_ to love that puppy, or else he will never be happy,
will he, Padre?"Why would this girl persist in ending her statements with an
interrogation!How could he know whether Cucumbra's happiness would be
imperfect if he failed in love toward the puppy?"Because, you know, Padre," the child continued, coming up to him and
slipping her hand into his, "padre Rosendo once told me that God was
Love; and after that I knew we just had to love everything and
everybody, or else He can't see us--can He, Padre?"He can't see us--if we don't love everything and everybody!Jose
wondered what sort of interpretation the Vatican, with its fiery
hatred of heretics, would put upon this remark."Dear child, in these matters you are teaching me; not I you," replied
the noncommittal priest."But, Padre, you are going to teach the people in the church," the
girl ventured quizzically.In his hour of need the
answer was vouchsafed him."Yes, dearest child--and I am going to teach them what I learn from
_you_."Carmen regarded him for a moment uncertainly."But, padre Rosendo says
you are to teach _me_," she averred."And so I am, little one," the priest replied; "but not one half as
much as I shall learn from you."Dona Maria's summons to breakfast interrupted the conversation.Throughout the repast Jose felt himself subjected to the closest
scrutiny by Carmen.What was running through her thought, he could
only vaguely surmise.But he instinctively felt that he was being
weighed and appraised by this strange child, and that she was finding
him wanting in her estimate of what manner of man a priest of God
ought to be.And yet he knew that she embraced him in her great love.Oftentimes his quick glance at her would find her serious gaze bent
upon him.But whenever their eyes met, her sweet face would instantly
relax and glow with a smile of tenderest love--a love which, he felt,
was somehow, in some way, destined to reconstruct his shattered life.Jose's plans for educating the girl had gradually evolved into
completion during the past two days.He explained them at length to
Rosendo after the morning meal; and the latter, with dilating eyes,
manifested his great joy by clasping the priest in his brawny arms."But remember, Rosendo," Jose said, "learning is not _knowing_.I can
only teach her book-knowledge.But even now, an untutored child, she
knows more that is real than I do.""Ah, Padre, have I not told you many times that she is not like us?exclaimed the emotional Rosendo, his eyes
suffused with tears of joy as he beheld his cherished ideals and his
longing of years at last at the point of realization.What he, too,
had instinctively seen in the child was now to be summoned forth; and
the vague, half-understood motive which had impelled him to take the
abandoned babe from Badillo into the shelter of his own great heart
would at length be revealed.With a final
clasp of the priest's hand, he rushed from the house to plunge into
the work in progress at the church.Jose summoned Carmen into the quiet of his own dwelling.She came
joyfully, bringing an ancient and obsolete arithmetic and a much
tattered book, which Jose discovered to be a chronicle of the heroic
deeds of the early _Conquistadores_.she exclaimed with glistening eyes; "and I've
read some of this, but I don't like it," making a little _moue_ of
disgust and holding aloft the battered history."Padre Rosendo told me to show it to you," she continued."But it is
all about murder, you know.And yet," with a little sigh, "he has
nothing else to read, excepting old newspapers which the steamers
sometimes leave at Bodega Central.And they are all about murder, and
stealing, and bad things, too.Padre, why don't people write about
good things?"Jose gazed at her reverently, as of old the sculptor Phidias might
have stood in awe before the vision which he saw in the unchiseled
marble."Padre Rosendo helped me with the fractions," went on the girl,
flitting lightly to another topic; "but I had to learn the decimals
myself.And they are so easy, aren't
they?hugging the old book to her little
bosom.Both volumes, printed in Madrid, were reliques of Spanish colonial
days."Read to me, Carmen," said Jose, handing her the history.The child took the book and began to read, with clear enunciation, the
narrative of Quesada's sanguinary expedition to Bogota, undertaken in
the name of the gentle Christ.Jose wondered as he listened what
interpretation this fresh young mind would put upon the motives of
that renowned exploit.The precipitation with which the question had been propounded almost
took his breath away.He raised his eyes to hers, and looked long and
wonderingly into their infinite depths.And then the vastness of the
problem enunciated by her demand loomed before him.What, after all,
did he know about Jesus?Had he not arrived in Simiti in a state of
agnosticism regarding religion?Had he not come there enveloped in
confusion, baffled, beaten, hopeless?And then, after his wonderful
talk with Rosendo, had he not agreed with him that the child's thought
must be kept free and open--that her own instinctive religious ideas
must be allowed to develop normally, unhampered and unfettered by the
external warp and bias of human speculation?It was part of his plan
that all reference to matters theological should be omitted from
Carmen's educational scheme.Yet here was that name on her lips--the
first time he had ever heard it voiced by her.And it smote him like a
hammer."Not now, little one," he said hastily."I want to hear you read more
from your book.""No," she replied firmly, laying the volume upon the table."I don't
like it; and I shouldn't think you would, either.Besides, it isn't
true; it never really happened.""Why, of course it is true, child!It is history, the story of how the
brave Spaniards came into this country long ago.We will read a great
deal more about them later.""No," with a decisive shake of her brown head; "not if it is like
this.It isn't true; I told padre Rosendo it wasn't.""Well, what do you mean, child?""It is only a lot of bad thoughts printed in a book," she replied
slowly."And it isn't true, because God is _everywhere_."Clearly the man was encountering difficulties at the outset; and a
part, at least, of his well-ordered curriculum stood in grave danger
of repudiation at the hands of this earnest little maid.The girl stood looking at him wistfully.Then her sober little face
melted in smiles.With childish impulsiveness she clambered into his
lap, and twining her arms about his neck, impressed a kiss upon his
cheek."I love you, Padre," she murmured; "and you love me, don't you?"He pressed her to him, startled though he was."God knows I do, little
one!""Of course He does," she eagerly agreed; "and He knows you don't want
to teach me anything that isn't true, doesn't He, Padre dear?"Yea, and more; for Jose was realizing now, what he had not seen
before, that _it was beyond his power to teach her that which was not
true_.The magnitude and sacredness of his task impressed him as never
before.His puzzled brain grappled feebly with the enormous problem.She had rebuked him for trying to teach her things which, if he
accepted the immanence of God as fact, her logic had shown him were
utterly false.Clearly the grooves in which this child's pure thought
ran were not his own.And if she would not think as he did, what
recourse was there left him but to accept the alternative and think
with her?For he would not, even if he could, force upon her his own
thought-processes."Then, Carmen," he finally ventured, "you do not wish to learn about
people and what they have done and are doing in the big world about
you?""Oh, yes, Padre; tell me all about the good things they did!""But they did many wicked things too, _chiquita_.And the good and the
bad are all mixed up together.""No," she shook her head vigorously; "there isn't any bad.There is
only good, for God is everywhere--isn't He?"She raised up and looked squarely into the priest's eyes.Dissimulation,
hypocrisy, quibble, cant--nothing but fearless truth could meet that
gaze.Suddenly a light broke in upon his clouded thought.This girl--this
tender plant of God--why, she had shown it from the very beginning!And he, oh, blind that he was!The
secret of her power, of her ecstasy of life--what was it but
this?--_she knew no evil!_

And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."It was the first--the very first--lesson which Thou
didst teach Thy child, Israel, as the curtain rose upon the drama of
human life!And the awful warning has rung down through the corridors
of time from the mouths of the prophets, whom we slew lest they wake
us from our mesmeric sleep!Israel forgot Thy words; and the world has
forgotten them, long, long since.Daily we mix our perfumed draft of
good and evil, and sink under its lethal influence!Hourly we eat of
the forbidden tree, till the pangs of death encompass us!And when at last the dark angel hovered over the sin-stricken earth
and claimed it for his own, the great Master came to sound again the
warning--"As a man thinketh in his heart, _so is he_!"But they would
have none of him, and nailed him to a tree!Even the unique Son of God
wept as he looked with yearning upon you!Because of your
stubborn clinging to false ways, false beliefs, false thoughts of God
and man!Because ye would not be healed; ye would not be made whole!Ye loved evil--ye gave it life and power, and ye rolled it like a
sweet morsel beneath your tongue--and so ye died!So came death into
this fair world, through the heart, the brain, the mind of man, _who
sought to know what God could not_!"Padre dear, you are so quiet."The girl nestled closer to the awed
priest.And so the multitude on Sinai had stood in awed quiet as
they listened to the voice of God.The man could not grasp the infinite
import of the marvelous fact.And yet he had sought to teach her
falsities--to teach her that evil did exist, as real and as potent
as good, and that it was to be accepted and honored by mankind!But
she had turned her back upon the temptation."Padre, are you going to tell me about Jesus?""Yes, yes--I want to know nothing else!I will get my Bible, and we
will read about him!""But have you never--has your padre Rosendo never told you that it is
the book that tells--?""But," her face kindling, "he told me
that Jesus was God's only son.But we are all His children, aren't
we?"But Jesus was the greatest--"

"Did Jesus write the Bible, Padre?""No--we don't know who did.People used to think God wrote it; but I
guess He didn't.""Then we will not read it, Padre."The man bent reverently over the little brown head and prayed again
for guidance.What could he do with this child, who dwelt with
Jehovah--who saw His reflection in every flower and hill and fleecy
cloud--who heard His voice in the sough of the wind, and the ripple of
the waters on the pebbly shore!And, oh, that some one had bent over
him and prayed for guidance when he was a tender lad and his heart
burned with yearning for truth!"God wrote the arithmetic--I mean, He told people how to write it,
didn't He, Padre?"Surely the priest could acquiesce in this, for mathematics is purely
metaphysical, and without guile.And we will go right through this little book.Then,
if I can, I will send for others that will teach you wonderful things
about what we call mathematics."The priest had now found the only path
which she would tread with him, and he continued with enthusiasm."And God taught people how to talk, little one; but they don't all
talk as we do.There is a great land up north of us, which we call the
United States, and there the people would not understand us, for we
speak Spanish.I must teach you their language, _chiquita_, and I must
teach you others, too, for you will not always live in Simiti.""I want to stay here always, Padre."No, Carmen; God
has work for you out in His big world.You have something to tell His
people some day, a message for them.But you and I have much work to
do here first.And so we will begin with the arithmetic and English.Later we will study other languages, and we will talk them to each
other until you speak them as fluently as your own.And meanwhile, I
will tell you about the great countries of the world, and about the
people that live in them.And we will study about the stars, and the
rocks, and the animals; and we will read and work and read and work
all day long, every day!"The priest's face was aglow with animation."But, Padre, when shall I have time to think?""Why, you will be thinking all the time, child!""What other things do
you have to think about, _chiquita_?""About all the people here who are sick and unhappy, and who quarrel
and don't love one another.""Do you think about people when they are sick?"she replied vigorously "When they are sick I go where
nobody can find me and then just think that it isn't so.""_Hombre!_" the priest ejaculated, his astonishment soaring Then--

"But when people are sick it is really so, isn't it, _chiquita_?""It can't be--not if God is everywhere.The child drove the heart-searching question straight
into him."Why--no, I can't say that He does."Because they think bad things, Padre.And they don't care about Him--they
don't love Him.And so they get sick," she explained succinctly.Jose's mind reverted to what Rosendo had told him.When he lay tossing
in delirium Carmen had said that he would not die.And yet that was
perfectly logical, if she refused to admit the existence of evil."I thought lots about you last week, Padre."The soft voice was close to his ear, and every breath swept over his
heartstrings and made them vibrate."Every night when I went to sleep I told God I _knew_ He would cure
you."Verily, I have not seen such faith, no, not in Israel!And the faith
of this child had glorified her vision until she saw "the heavens open
and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.""Carmen"--the priest spoke reverently--"do the sick ones always get
well when you think about them?"There was not a shade of euphemism in the unhesitating reply--

"They are never really sick, Padre.""But, by that you mean--"

"They only have bad thoughts."he suggested by way of drawing out her full
meaning."Yes, Padre--for God, you know, really _is_ everywhere.""What put such ideas into your little head?Yes, of a verity she spoke truth.For nothing but her constant
communion with Him could have filled her pure thought with a deeper,
truer lore than man has ever quaffed at the world's great fountains of
learning.He himself, trained by Holy Church, deeply versed in
letters, science, and theology, grounded in all human learning, sat in
humility at her feet, drinking in what his heart told him he had at
length found--Truth."Carmen, how do you know, how are you
sure, that He told you?""But just how do you know that it is true?""Why--it comes out that way; just like the answers to the problems in
arithmetic.I used to try to see if by thinking only good thoughts
to-day I would be better and happier to-morrow.""Well, I always was, Padre.And so now I don't think anything but good
thoughts.""That is, you think only about God?""I always think about Him _first_, Padre."He had no further need to question her proofs, for he knew she was
taught by the Master himself."That will be all for this morning, Carmen," he said quietly, as he
put her down.I, too, have some thinking to do."When Carmen left him, Jose lapsed into profound meditation.Musing
over his life experiences, he at last summed them all up in the vain
attempt to evolve an acceptable concept of God, an idea of Him that
would satisfy.He had felt that in Christianity he had hold of
something beneficent, something real; but he had never been able to
formulate it, nor lift it above the shadows into the clear light
of full comprehension.And the result of his futile efforts to this
end had been agnosticism.His inability conscientiously to accept
the mad reasoning of theologians and the impudent claims of Rome had
been the stumbling block to his own and his family's dearest earthly
hopes.He knew that popular Christianity was a disfigurement of truth.He knew that the theological claptrap which the Church, with such
oracular assurance, such indubitable certainty and gross assumption
of superhuman knowledge, handed out to a suffering world, was a
travesty of the divinely simple teachings of Jesus, and that it had
estranged mankind from their only visible source of salvation, the
Bible.He saw more clearly than ever before that in the actual
achievements of popular theology there had been ridiculously little
that a seriously-minded man could accept as supports to its claims
to be a divinely revealed scheme of salvation.Yet there was no
vital question on which certainty was so little demanded, and
seemingly of so little consequence, as this, even though the
joints of the theologians' armor flapped wide to the assaults of
unprejudiced criticism.But if the slate were swept clean--if current theological dogma were
overthrown, and the stage set anew--what could be reared in their
stead?Is it true that the Bible is based upon propositions which can
be verified by all?The explorer in Cartagena had given Jose a new
thought in Arnold's concept of God as "the Eternal, not ourselves,
that makes for righteousness."And it was not to be denied that, from
first to last, the Bible is a call to righteousness.Assuredly something vastly
more profound, for even that "misses the mark."No, righteousness was
right conduct until the marvelous Jesus appeared.But he swept it at
once from the material into the mental; from the outward into the
inward; and defined it as _right-thinking_!murmured Jose, sitting with head buried in his hands."Aye, the whole scheme of salvation is held in that one word!And the
wreck of my life has been caused by my blind ignorance of its
tremendous meaning!But Carmen, wise
little soul, divined it instinctively; for, if there is one thing that
is patent, it is that if a thing is evil it does not exist for her.Of course it means _thinking no evil_!Jesus lived his
thorough understanding of it.And so would the
world, but for the withering influence of priestly authority!"At that moment Carmen reappeared to summon him to lunch."Come here, little girl," said Jose, drawing her to him."You asked me
to tell you about Jesus.He was the greatest and best man that ever
lived.And it was because he never had a bad thought."The little face turned lovingly
up to his.And so do I--now; for I have found Him even in
desolate Simiti."CHAPTER 7


Carmen's studies began in earnest that afternoon.In the quiet of his
humble cottage Jose, now "a prisoner of the Lord," opened the door of
his mental storehouse and carefully selected those first bits of
knowledge for the foundation stones on which to rear for her, little
by little, a broad education.He found her a facile learner; her thorough ease in the rudiments
of arithmetic and in the handling of her own language delighted him.His plan of tutelage, although the result of long contemplation, and
involving many radical ideas regarding the training of children,
ideas which had been slowly developing in his mind for years, he
nevertheless felt in her case to be tentative.For he was dealing
with no ordinary child; and so the usual methods of instruction were
here wholly out of the question.But on several points he was already firmly resolved.First, he would
get well below the surface of this child's mind, and he would endeavor
to train her to live in a depth of thought far, far beneath the froth
and superficiality of the every-day thinking of mankind.Fortunately,
she had had no previous bad training to be counteracted now.Nature
had been her only tutor; and Rosendo's canny wisdom had kept out all
human interference.Her unusual and
mature thought had set up an intellectual barrier between herself and
the playmates she might have had.Fortunately, too, Jose had now to
deal with a child who all her life had thought vigorously--and, he was
forced to conclude, correctly.Habits of accurate observation and
quick and correct interpretation would not be difficult to form in
such a mind.Moreover, to this end he would aim to maintain her
interest at the point of intensity in every subject undertaken; yet
without forcing, and without sacrifice of the joys of childhood.He
would be, not teacher only, but fellow-student.He would strive to
learn with her to conceive the ideal without losing sight of the fact
that it was a human world in which they dwelt.When she wished to
play, he would play with her.But he would contrive and direct their
amusements so as to carry instruction, to elucidate and exemplify it,
to point morals, and steadily to contribute to her store of knowledge.But he could not know then that
Nature--if we may thus call it--had anticipated him, and that the
child, long since started upon the quest for truth, would quickly
outstrip him in the matter of conceiving the ideal and living in this
world of relative fact with an eye single to the truth which shines so
dimly through it.Jose knew, as he studied Carmen and planned her training, that
whatever instruction he offered her must be without taint of evil, so
far as he might prevent.And yet, the thought of any attempt to
withhold from her a knowledge of evil brought a sardonic smile to his
lips.She had as yet everything to learn of the world about her.Could
such learning be imparted to her free from error or hypothesis, and
apart from the fiat of the speculative human mind?It must be; for he
knew from experience that she would accept his teaching only as he
presented every apparent fact, every object, every event, as a
reflection in some degree of her immanent God, and subject to rigid
demonstration.Where historical events externalized only the evil
motives of the carnal mind, he must contrive to omit them entirely, or
else present them as unreality, the result of "bad thoughts" and
forgetfulness of God.In other words, only as he assumed to be the
channel through which God spoke to her could he hope for success.To
impart to her a knowledge of both good and evil was, at least at
present, impossible.To force it upon her later would be criminal.Moreover, _why not try the audacious experiment of permitting and
aiding this child to grow up without a knowledge of evil_?--that is,
in her present conviction that only good is real, potent and
permanent, while evil is impotent illusion and to be met and overcome
on that basis.Would the resultant training make of her a tower of
strength--or would it render her incapable of resisting the onslaughts
of evil when at length she faced the world?His own heart sanctioned
the plan; and--well, the final judgment should be left to Carmen
herself.At times Cucumbra interrupted by bounding
in, as if impatient of the attention his little mistress was giving
her tutor.Frequently the inquisitive Cantar-las-horas stalked through
the room, displaying a most dignified and laudable interest in the
proceedings.Late in the afternoon, when the sun was low, Bosendo
appeared at the door.As he stood listening to Jose's narrative of men
and places in the outside world, his eyes bulged.At length his
untutored mind became strained to its elastic limit.he could not refrain from interrupting, when
Jose had spoken of the fast trains of England."Why, the Simiti trail
to Tachi is one hundred and fifty miles long; and it always took me
six days to walk it.And do you say there are trains that travel that
distance in as many hours?""There are trains, Rosendo, that traverse the distance in three
hours.""_Na_, Padre, it can't be done!"cried the incredulous Rosendo,
shaking his head."I have more
pliable material here to handle than you."But Rosendo remained; and it was evident to the priest that he had
come on an errand of importance.Moreover, the supper hour was at
hand, and perhaps Dona Maria needed Carmen's help.So, dismissing the
child, Jose turned to Rosendo."You were right," he began, as if taking up the thread of a broken
discourse."Carmen _was_ left on the river bank by the angels.""Then you do think it was a miracle!"said Rosendo in a voice of awe,
as he sank into a chair."Everything is a miracle, friend; for a miracle is
simply a sign of God's presence.And finding Carmen in this musty,
forgotten place is one of the greatest."Yes, Padre, that is true," assented Rosendo gravely."I was led here," continued Jose; "I see it now.Rosendo, all my life
I have regarded evil as just as real and powerful as good.And my life
has been one of bitterness and woe.Carmen sees only the good God
everywhere.Simply that my mental attitude has been all wrong, my views erroneous,
my thinking bad.I have tried to know both good and evil, to eat of
the forbidden tree.And for so doing I was banished from paradise."Why--well, no, Padre--that is, I--" The honest fellow was becoming
confused."Well, just this, then," explained the priest with animation."I
haven't gotten anywhere in life, and neither have you, because we have
limited ourselves and crippled our efforts by yielding to fear, pride,
ignorance, and the belief in evil as a real power opposed to good.""I have often wondered myself, Padre, how there could be a devil if
God is almighty.For in that case He would have had to make the devil,
wouldn't He?""And as He did make
everything, then either He made the devil, or else there isn't any.""But that is pretty hard to see, Padre," replied the puzzled Rosendo."Simply the belief that there is a power apart from God.""But doesn't that belief come from the devil?"Listen, Rosendo: Carmen is daily
putting into practice her instinctive knowledge of a mighty fact.She
will reveal it all to us in due time.Let us patiently watch her, and
try to see and understand and believe as she does.But in the
meantime, let us guard our minds as we would a treasure house, and
strive never to let a thought of evil get inside!My past life should
serve as a perpetual warning."Rosendo did not reply at once, but sat staring vacantly at the ground.Jose knew that his thoughts were with his wayward daughter.Then, as
if suddenly remembering the object of his call, he took from his
wallet two letters, which he handed to Jose with the comment: "Juan
brought them up from Bodega Central this morning."One was from Spain, from his
uncle.It was six weeks old when it arrived in
Simiti, and had been written before the news of his removal from
Cartagena had reached Seville.His mother was well; and her hopes for
her son's preferment were steadily reviving, after the cruel blow
which his disgrace in Rome had given them.For his uncle's part, he
hoped that Jose had now seen the futility of opposition to Holy
Church, and that, yielding humbly to her gentle chastisement for the
great injury he had inflicted upon her, he would now make amends and
merit the favors which she was sure to bestow upon him in due season.To this end the uncle would bring to bear his own influence and that
of His Eminence, the Archbishop of Seville.The letter closed with an
invocation to the Saints and the ever-blessed Virgin.It was nominally from the Bishop of
Cartagena, although written, he well knew, by Wenceslas.His Reverence
regretted that Jose had not come to him again before leaving
Cartagena.He deplored exceedingly the necessity of assigning him to
so lowly a parish; but it was discipline.His tenure of the parish
would be a matter of probation.Assuming a penitent desire on the part
of the priest to make reparation for past indiscretions, His Grace
extended assurances of his support and tender consideration.And,
regarding him still as a faithful son, he was setting forth herewith
certain instructions which Jose would zealously carry out, to the
glory of the sacred Mother Church and the blessed Virgin, and to his
own edification, to wit: In the matter of the confessional he must be
unremittingly zealous, not failing to put such questions to the people
of Simiti as would draw out their most secret thoughts.In the present
crisis it was especially necessary to learn their political views.Likewise, he must not fail to impress upon them the sin of concealing
wealth, and of withholding contributions to the support of the
glorious Mother.He, as priest of the parish, would be held personally
responsible for the collection of an adequate "Peter's Pence," which
must be sent to Cartagena at frequent intervals for subsequent
shipment to Rome.For all contributions he was to allow liberal
plenary indulgences.In the matter of inciting zeal for the salvation
of those unfortunate souls lingering in the torments of purgatory,
Jose must be unflagging.Each family in the parish should be
constantly admonished and threatened, if necessary, to have Masses
said for their deceased members; and he must forward the proceeds from
such Masses at once to Cartagena.No less important, he must keep
constantly before him the great fact that the hope of the blessed
Mother lay in her young.To this end he must see that all children in
his parish were in due time confirmed, and every effort made to have
the females sent to the convent of Mompox.To encourage his
parishioners, he might assure them of His Reverence's tender regard
for them as his beloved children, and that he had certain special
favors to grant to them in due time.Also, that a statue of the
Virgin, which had arrived from Rome, and which carried the most potent
blessing of the Holy Father, was to be bestowed upon that church in
the diocese which within the next twelve months should contribute the
largest amount of Peter's Pence in proportion to population.This plan
should be especially attractive to the people of Simiti, as the town
lay on the confines of a district renowned in the ancient annals for
its mineral wealth.Herein, too, lay a great opportunity for the
priest; and His Reverence rejoiced in the certain knowledge that he
would embrace it.Invoking the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the
Ever-Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph, His Grace awaited with interest
the priest's first report from the parish of Simiti.The letter fell like a wet blanket upon Jose, chilling him to the
marrow, for it revived with cruel poignancy the fact that he was still
a servant of Rome.In the past few happy days he had dwelt apart from
the world in the consciousness of a new heaven and a new earth,
revealed by Carmen.This sudden call to duty was like a summons from
Mephistopheles to the fulfillment of a forgotten pact.Beneath the specious kindliness of
Wenceslas lay sinister motives, he knew.But--a darker thought--did Wenceslas know of Carmen's existence?Could
Cartagena have received any intimation of his plans for her?Refusal
to comply with these instructions meant--he dared not think what!On
the other hand, strict compliance with them certainly was out of the
question.As for Peter's Pence, what could the impoverished folk of this
decrepit town furnish!And yet, if a reasonable sum could only be
contributed at frequent intervals, would not the vampire Wenceslas
rest content, at least for a while?Oh, for a fortune of his own, that
he might dump it all into the yawning maw of Holy Church, and thus
gain a few years' respite for himself and Carmen!Rosendo inquired, anxiously regarding the priest's
strained features.What could the man do or say, limited, hounded, and without resources?Could he force these simple people to buy Masses?Could he take their
money on a pretext which he felt to be utterly false?Yet Cartagena
_must_ be kept quiet at any hazard!"Rosendo," he asked earnestly, "when you had a priest in Simiti, did
the people have Masses offered for their dead?""_Na_, Padre, we have little money for Masses," replied Rosendo
sadly."At times--long ago--for my first wife, when she died without a
priest, up in the Tigui country.I
couldn't see how Masses said by that drunken priest could please God,
or make Him release souls from purgatory--and Padre Diego was drunk
most of the time.""Rosendo, we _must_ send money to the Bishop in
Cartagena.I _must_ stay here--I _must_!And I can stay only by
satisfying Wenceslas!If I can send him money he will think me too
valuable to remove.It is not the Church, Rosendo, but Wenceslas who
is persecuting me.He is using the
Church for his own evil ends.But I--I
can't make these poor people buy Masses!And--but here, read his
letter," thrusting it into Rosendo's hand.Rosendo shook his head thoughtfully, and a cloud had gathered over his
strong face when he returned the Bishop's letter to Jose."Padre, we will be hard pressed to support the church and you, without
buying Masses.There are about two hundred people here, perhaps fifty
families.Only a few can afford to pay
even a _peso oro_ a month to the schoolmaster to have their children
taught.They may be able to give twenty _pesos_ a month to support you
and the church.It seemed to Jose that his soul must burst under its limitations."Rosendo, let us take Carmen and flee!""How far would we get, Padre?He lapsed into silence-shrouded despair.The sun dropped below the wooded hills, and Cantar-las-horas had sung
his weird vesper song.Dusk was thickening into night, though upon the
distant _Sierras_ a mellow glow still illumined the frosted peaks.Moments crept slowly through the enveloping silence.Then the mental gloom parted, and through it arose the great soul of
the black-faced man sitting beside the despairing priest."Padre"--Rosendo spoke slowly and with deep emotion.Tears trickled
down his swart cheeks--"I am no longer young.More than sixty years of
hardship and heavy toil rest upon me.My parents--I have not told you
this--were slaves.They worked in the mines of Guamoco, under hard
masters.They lived in bamboo huts, and slept on the damp ground.At
four each morning, year after year, they were driven from their hard
beds and sent out to toil under the lash fourteen hours a day, washing
gold from the streams.The gold went to the building of Cartagena's
walls, and to her Bishop, to buy idleness and luxury for him and his
fat priests.When the war came it lasted thirteen years; but we drove
the Christian Spaniards into the sea!Then my father and mother went
back to Guamoco; and there I was born.When I was old enough to use a
_batea_ I, too, washed gold in the Tigui, and in the little streams so
numerous in that region.But they had been pretty well washed out
under the Spaniards; and so my father came down here and made a little
_hacienda_ on the hills across the lake from Simiti.Then he and my
poor mother lay down and died, worn out with their long years of toil
for their cruel masters."He brushed the tears from his eyes; then resumed: "The district of
Guamoco gradually became deserted.Revolution after revolution broke
out in this unhappy country, sometimes stirred up by the priests,
sometimes by political agitators who tried to get control of the
Government.The men and boys went to the wars, and were killed off.Guamoco was again swallowed up by the forest--"

He stopped abruptly, and sat some moments silent."I have been back there many times since, and often I have washed gold
again along the beautiful Tigui," he continued."But the awful
loneliness of the jungle, and the memories of those gloomy days when I
toiled there as a boy, and the thoughts of my poor parents' sufferings
under the Spaniards, made me so sad that I could not stay.And then I
got too old for that kind of work, standing bent over in the cold
mountain water all day long, swinging a _batea_ heavy with gravel."He paused again, and seemed to lose himself in the memory of those
dark days."But there is still gold in the Tigui.It means hard
work--but I can do it.Padre, I will go back there and wash out gold
for you to send to the Bishop of Cartagena, that you may stay here and
protect and teach the little Carmen.Perhaps in time I can wash enough
to get you both out of the country; but it will take many months, it
may be, years."O, you, whose path in life winds among pleasant places, where roses
nod in the scented breeze and fountains play, picture to yourself, if
you may, the self-immolation of this sweet-souled man, who, in the
winter of life, the shadows of eternity fast gathering about him,
bends his black shoulders again to the burden which Love would lay
upon them.Aye, Love, into which all else merged--Love for the unknown
babe, left helpless and alone on the great river's bank--Love for the
radiant child, whose white soul the agents of carnal greed and lust
would prostitute to their iniquitous system.By the light of their single candle the priest and Rosendo
ate their simple fare in silence.Carmen was asleep, and the angels
watched over her lowly bed.The meal ended, Rosendo took up the candle, and Jose followed him into
the bedroom.Reverently the two men approached the sleeping child and
looked down upon her.The priest's hand again sought Rosendo's in a
grasp which sealed anew the pact between them.CHAPTER 8


Like the great Exemplar in the days of his preparation, Jose was
early driven by the spirit into the wilderness, where temptation
smote him sore.But his soul had been saved--"yet so as by fire."Slowly old beliefs and faiths crumbled into dust, while the new
remained still unrevealed.The drift toward atheism which had set in
during his long incarceration in the convent of Palazzola had not
made him yield to the temptation to raise the mask of hypocrisy and
plunge into the pleasures of the world, nor accept the specious
proffer of ecclesiastical preferment in exchange for his honest
convictions.Honor, however bigoted the sense, bound him to his
oath, or at least to a compromising observance of it harmless to the
Church.Pride contributed to hold him from the degradation of a
renegade and apostate priest.And both rested primarily on an
unshaken basis of maternal affection, which fell little short of
obsession, leaving him without the strength to say, "Woman, what
have I to do with thee?"But, though atheism in belief leads almost inevitably to disintegration
of morals, Jose had kept himself untainted.For his vital problems he
had now, after many days, found "grace sufficient."In what he had
regarded as the contemptible tricks of fate, he was beginning to
discern the guiding hand of a wisdom greater than the world's.The
danger threatened by Cartagena was, temporarily, at least, averted
by Rosendo's magnificent spirit.Under the spur of that sacrifice his
own courage rose mightily to second it.Rosendo spent the day in preparation for his journey into the Guamoco
country.He had discussed with Jose, long and earnestly, its probable
effect upon the people of Simiti, and especially upon Don Mario, the
Alcalde; but it was decided that no further explanation should be made
than that he was again going to prospect in the mineral districts
already so familiar to him.As Rosendo had said, this venture,
together with the unannounced and unsolicited presence of the priest
in the town, could not but excite extreme curiosity and raise the most
lively conjectures, which might, in time, reach Wenceslas.On the
other hand, if success attended his efforts, it was more than probable
that Cartagena would remain quiet, as long as her itching palm was
brightened with the yellow metal which he hoped to wrest from the
sands of Guamoco."It is only a chance, Padre," Rosendo said
dubiously."In the days of the Spaniards the river sands of Guamoco
produced from two to ten _reales_ a day to each slave.But the rivers
have been almost washed out."A Spanish _real_ was equivalent
to half a franc.Then ten _reales_ would amount to five francs, the
very best he could hope for as a day's yield."And my supplies and the support of the senora and Carmen must come
out of that," Rosendo added."Besides, I must pay Juan for working the
_hacienda_ across the lake for me while I am away."Possibly ten _pesos oro_, or forty francs, might remain at the end of
each month for them to send to Cartagena.Jose sighed heavily as he
busied himself with the preparations."I got these supplies from Don Mario on credit, Padre," explained
Rosendo."I thought best to buy from him to prevent making him angry.I have coffee, _panela_, rice, beans, and tobacco for a month.He was
very willing to let me have them--but do you know why?He wants me to
go up there and fail.Then he will have me in his debt, and I become
his _peon_--and I would never be anything after that but his slave,
for never again would he let me get out of debt to him."Jose shuddered at the thought of the awful system of peonage prevalent
in these Latin countries, an inhuman custom only a degree removed from
the slavery of colonial times.This venture was, without doubt, a
desperate risk.But it was for Carmen--and its expediency could not be
questioned.Jose penned a letter to the Bishop of Cartagena that morning, and
sent it by Juan to Bodega Central to await the next down-river
steamer.He did not know that Juan carried another letter for the
Bishop, and addressed in the flowing hand of the Alcalde.Jose
briefly acknowledged the Bishop's communication, and replied that he
would labor unflaggingly to uplift his people and further their
spiritual development.As to the Bishop's instructions, he would
endeavor to make Simiti's contribution to the support of Holy
Church, both material and spiritual, fully commensurate with the
population.He did not touch on the other instructions, but closed
with fervent assurances of his intention to serve his little flock
with an undivided heart.Carmen received no lesson that day, and
her rapidly flowing questions anent the unusual activity in the
household were met with the single explanation that her padre
Rosendo had found it necessary to go up to the Tigui river, a
journey which some day she might perhaps take with him.During the afternoon Jose wrote two more letters, one to his uncle,
briefly announcing his appointment to the parish of Simiti, and his
already lively interest in his new field; the other to his beloved
mother, in which he only hinted at the new-found hope which served as
his pillow at night.He did not mention Carmen, for fear that his
letter might be opened ere it left Cartagena.But in tenderest
expressions of affection, and regret that he had been the unwitting
cause of his mother's sorrow, he begged her to believe that his life
had received a stimulus which could not but result in great happiness
for them both, for he was convinced that he had at last found his
_metier_, even though among a lowly people and in a sequestered part
of the world.He hoped again to be reunited to her--possibly she might
some day meet him in Cartagena.And until then he would always hold
her in tenderest love and the brightest and purest thought.He brushed aside the tears as he folded this letter; and, lest regret
and self-condemnation seize him again, hurried forth in search of
Carmen, whose radiance always dispelled his gloom as the rushing dawn
shatters the night.She was not in Rosendo's house, and Dona Maria said she had seen the
child some time before going in the direction of the "shales."These
were broad beds of rock to the south of town, much broken and deeply
fissured, and so glaringly hot during most of the day as to be
impassable.Thither Jose bent his steps, and at length came upon the
girl sitting in the shade of a stunted _algarroba_ tree some distance
from the usual trail."Well, what are you doing here, little one?""I was thinking, Padre," she
made slow reply."But do you have to go away from home to think?""I wanted to be alone; and there was so much going on in the house
that I came out here.""And what have you been thinking about, Carmen?"pursued Jose,
suspecting that her presence in the hot shale beds held some deeper
significance than she had as yet revealed."I--I was just thinking that God is everywhere," she faltered."That He is where padre Rosendo is going, and that He will take care
of him up there, and bring him back to Simiti again.""And were you asking Him to do it, little one?""No, Padre; I was just _knowing_ that He would."The little lip quivered, and the brown eyes were wet with tears.But
Jose could see that faith had conquered, whatever the struggle might
have been.The child evidently had sought solitude, that she might
most forcibly bring her trust in God to bear upon the little problem
confronting her--that she might make the certainty of His immanence
and goodness destroy in her thought every dark suggestion of fear or
doubt."God will take care of him, won't He, Padre?"Jose had taken her hand and was leading her back to the house."You have said it, child; and I believe you are a law unto yourself,"
was the priest's low, earnest reply.The child smiled up at him; and
Jose knew he had spoken truth.That evening, the preparations for departure completed, Rosendo and
Jose took their chairs out before the house, where they sat late, each
loath to separate lest some final word be left unsaid.The tepid
evening melted into night, which died away in a deep silence that hung
wraith-like over the old town.Myriad stars rained their shimmering
lustre out of the unfathomable vault above."_Un canasto de flores_," mused Rosendo, looking off into the infinite
blue."A basket of flowers, indeed," responded Jose reverently."Padre--" Rosendo's brain seemed to struggle with a tremendous
thought--"I often try to think of what is beyond the stars; and I
cannot."But, if we could get out to the last star--what then?""Still no end, no limit," replied Jose."And they are very far away--how far, Padre?""You would not comprehend, even if I could tell you, Rosendo.Others so far that
their light reaches us only after the lapse of centuries."Light from those stars above us travels nearly two hundred
thousand miles a second--"

"_Hombre!_" ejaculated the uncomprehending Rosendo."And yet, even at that awful rate of speed, it is probable that there
are many stars whose light has not yet reached the earth since it
became inhabited by men.""_Caramba!_"

"You may well say so, friend.""But, Padre--does the light never stop?When does it reach an end--a
stopping-place?""There is no stopping-place, Rosendo.Go whichever way you will, you can never reach an end."Rosendo's brow knotted with puzzled wonder: Even Jose's own mind
staggered anew at its concept of the immeasurable depths of space."But, Padre, if we could go far enough up we would get to heaven,
wouldn't we?""And if we went far enough down we
would reach purgatory, and then hell, is it not so?"He dared not answer lest he reveal his
own paucity of ideas regarding these things.Happily the loquacious
Rosendo continued without waiting for reply."Padre Simon used to say when I was a child that the red we saw in the
sky at sunset was the reflection of the flames of hell; so I have
always thought that hell was below us--perhaps in the center of the
earth."For a time his simple mind mused over this puerile idea.Then--

"What do you suppose God looks like, Padre?"Jose's thought flew back to the galleries and chapels of Europe, where
the masters have so often portrayed their ideas of God in the shape of
an old, gray-haired man, partly bald, and with long, flowing beard.how pitifully crude, how lamentably impotent such childish
concepts.For they saw in God only their own frailties infinitely
magnified.Small wonder that they lived and died in spiritual gloom!"Padre," Rosendo went on, "if there is no limit to the universe, then
it is--"

"Infinite in extent, Rosendo," finished Jose."Then whoever made it is infinite, too," Rosendo added hypothetically."An infinite effect implies an infinite cause--yes, certainly," Jose
answered."So, if God made the universe, He is infinite, is He not, Padre?""Then He can't be at all like us," was the logical conclusion.And
scientists agree that it is infinite in extent.Its creator therefore
must be infinite in extent.And as the universe continues to exist,
that which called it into being, and still maintains it, must likewise
continue to exist."Padre, what holds the stars in place?"Rosendo's questions were as
persistent as a child's."They are held in place by laws, Rosendo," the priest replied
evasively.But as he made answer he revolved in his own mind that the
laws by which an infinite universe is created and maintained must
themselves be infinite.But, the priest mused, a power great enough to frame infinite laws
must be itself all-powerful.And if it has ever been all-powerful, it
could never cease to be so, for there could be nothing to deprive it
of its power.Or, what is the
same thing, is all-inclusive.But laws originate, even as among human beings, in mind, for a law is
a mental thing.So the infinite laws which bind the stars together,
and by which the universe was designed and is still maintained, could
have originated only in a mind, and that one infinite."Then God surely must know everything," commented Rosendo, by way of
simple and satisfying conclusion.Certainly the creator of an infinite universe--a universe, moreover,
which reveals intelligence and knowledge on the part of its cause--the
originator of infinite laws, which reveal omnipotence in their
maker--must have all knowledge, all wisdom, at his command.But, on
the other hand, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, are ever mental
things.What could embrace these things, and by them create an
infinite universe, but an infinite _mind_?Jose's thought reverted to Cardinal Newman's reference to God as "an
initial principle."Surely the history of the universe reveals the
patent fact that, despite the mutations of time, despite growth,
maturity, and decay, despite "the wreck of matter and the crash of
worlds," _something_ endures.Yes, the mind which is the _anima mundi_, the
principle, of all things."But if He is so great, Padre, and knows everything, I don't see why
He made the devil," continued Rosendo; "for the devil fights against
Him all the time."A mind so pure as yours should
give no heed to thoughts of Satan.And the man at your side is now too
deeply buried in the channels which run below the superficiality of
the world's thought to hear your childish question.The cause of
an infinite effect must itself be infinite.The framer of infinite
laws must be an infinite mind.And an infinite mind must contain all
knowledge, and have all power.But were it to contain any seeds or
germs of decay, or any elements of discord--in a word, any evil--it
must disintegrate.Verily, to be
eternal and perfect _it must be wholly good_!"And so," the priest
mused aloud, "we call it God."But, he continued to reflect, when we accept the conclusion that the
universe is the product of an infinite mind, we are driven to certain
other inevitable conclusions, if we would be logical.The minds of men
manifest themselves continually, and the manifestation is in mental
processes and things.Mental activity results in the unfolding of
ideas.Does the activity of an infinite mind differ in this respect?And, if not, can the universe be other than a mental thing?For, if an
infinite mind created a universe, it must have done so _by the
unfolding of its own ideas_!And, remaining infinite, filling all
space, this mind must ever continue to contain those ideas.And the
universe--the creation--is mental.The burden of thought oppressed the priest, and he got up from his
chair and paced back and forth before the house.But still his
searching mind burrowed incessantly, as if it would unearth a living
thing that had been buried since the beginning.In order to fully express itself, an infinite mind would have to
unfold an infinite number and variety of ideas.And this unfolding
would go on forever, since an infinite number is never reached.This
is "creation," and it could never terminate."Rosendo," said Jose, returning to his chair, "you have asked what
God looks like.I cannot say, for God must be mind, unlimited mind.He
has all knowledge and wisdom, as well as all power.He is necessarily
eternal--has always existed, and always will, for He is entirely
perfect and harmonious, without the slightest trace or taint of
discord or evil.""Then you think He does not look like us?""Mind does not look like a human body, Rosendo.And an infinite cause
can be infinite only by being mind, not body.Moreover, He is
unchanging--for He could not change and remain eternal.Carmen insists
that He is everywhere.To be always present He must be what the Bible
says He is spirit.Or, what is the same thing, mind.Rosendo, He
manifests Himself everywhere and in everything--there is no other
conclusion admissible.And to be eternal He has got to be _absolutely
good_!""But, Padre," persisted Rosendo, "who made the devil?""But there is wickedness--"

"No!""God is infinite good, and there
can be no real evil.""But how do you know that, Padre?""I can't say how I know it--it reasons out that way logically.I think
I begin to see the light.Can you not see that for some reason Carmen
doesn't admit the existence of evil?And you know, and I know, that
she is on the right track.I have followed the opposite path all my
life; and it led right into the slough of despond.Now I have turned,
and am trying to follow her.And do you put the thought of Satan out
of your mentality and do likewise.""But, the Virgin Mary--she has power with God?"Rosendo's primitive
ideas were in a hopeless tangle."Good friend, forget the Virgin Mary," said Jose gently, laying his
hand on Rosendo's arm._Hombre!_ Why--she has all power--she works miracles
every hour--she directs the angels--gives commands to God himself!Padre Simon said she was the absolute mistress of heaven and earth,
and that men and animals, the plants, the winds, all health, sickness,
life and death, depended upon her will!He said she did not die as we
must, but that she was taken up into heaven, and that her body was not
allowed to decay and return to dust, as ours will._Hombre!_ She is in
heaven now, praying for us.What would become of us but for her?--for
she prays to God for us--she--!""No, Rosendo, she does nothing of the kind.He could not be moved or influenced by the Virgin Mary or
any one else.He is not angry with us--He
couldn't be, for He could not know anger.Did not Jesus say that God
was Love?Love does not afflict--Love does not need to be importuned
or prayed to.We
suffer when we sin, because we'miss the mark.'But the punishment
lasts only as long as the sin continues.And we suffer only until we
know that God is infinite good, and that there is no evil.That is the
truth, I feel sure, which Jesus came to teach, and which he said would
make us free.From the awful beliefs that use us, and
to which we are now subject, until we learn the facts about God and
His creation.Don't you see that infinite good could never create
evil, nor ever permit evil to be created, nor allow it to really
exist?""That we must wait to learn, Rosendo, little by little.You know, the
Spanish proverb says, 'Step by step goes a great way.'But meantime,
let us go forward, clinging to this great truth: God is infinite
good--He is love--we are His dear children--and evil was _not_ made by
Him, and does not have His sanction.And, being such, it can be overcome, as Jesus said
it could.""_Na_, Padre--"

"Wait, Rosendo!""Carmen is doing just what I
am advising you to do--is she not?""Padre, she knows God better than she knows me," the man whispered."It was you who first told her that God was everywhere, was it not?"And the mind of the child, keenly sensitive and receptive to truth,
had eagerly grasped this dictum and made it the motif of her life.She
knew nothing of Jesus, nothing of current theology.Divine Wisdom had
used Rosendo, credulous and superstitious though he himself was, to
guard this girl's mind against the entrance of errors which were
taught him as a child, and which in manhood held him shackled in
chains which he might not break."Rosendo," Jose spoke low and reverently, "I believe now that you and
I have both been guided by that great mind which I am calling God.I
believe we are being used for some beneficent purpose, and that it has
to do with Carmen.That purpose will be unfolded to us as we bow to
His will.Every way closed against me, excepting the one that led to
Simiti.And now there seems to be but one way open
to you--to go back to Guamoco.And you go, forgetful of self, thinking
only that you serve her.Ah, friend, you are serving Him whom you
reflect in love to His beautiful child.""But, while we accept our tasks gratefully, I feel that we shall be
tried--and we may not live to see the results of our labors.There are
influences abroad which threaten danger to Carmen and to us.But we have given ourselves to her, and
through her to the great purpose with which I feel she is concerned."Rosendo slowly rose, and his great height and magnificent physique
cast the shadow of a Brobdignan in the light as he stood in the
doorway."Padre," he replied, "I am an old man, and I have but few years left.But however many they be, they are hers.And had I a thousand, I would
drag them all through the fires of hell for the child!I cannot follow
you when you talk about God.But this I know, the
One who brought me here and then went away will some day call for
me--and I am always ready."He turned into the house and sought his hard bed.The great soul knew
not that he reflected the light of divine Love with a radiance unknown
to many a boasting "vicar of Christ."CHAPTER 9


At the first faint flush of morn Rosendo departed for the hills.The
emerald coronels of the giant _ceibas_ on the far lake verge burned
softly with a ruddy glow.From the water's dimpling surface downy
vapors rose languidly in delicate tints and drew slowly out in
nebulous bands across the dawn sky.The smiling softness of the
velvety hills beckoned him, and the pungent odor of moist earth
dilated his nostrils.He laughed aloud as the joyousness of youth
surged again through his veins.The village still slumbered, and no
one saw him as he smote his great chest and strode to the boat, where
Juan had disposed his outfit and was waiting to pole him across.Only
the faithful Dona Maria had softly called a final "_adioscito_" to him
when he left his house.A half hour later, when the dugout poked its
blunt nose into the ooze of the opposite shore, he leaped out and
hurriedly divested himself of his clothing.Then he lifted his chair
with its supplies to his shoulders, and Juan strapped it securely to
his back, drawing the heavy band tightly across his forehead.With a
farewell wave of his hand to the lad, the man turned and plunged into
the Guamoco trail, and was quickly lost in the dense thicket.Six days
later, if no accident befell, he would reach his destination, the
singing waters of the crystal Tigui.His heart leaped as he strode, though none knew better than he what
hardships those six days held for him--days of plunging through
fever-laden bogs; staggering in withering heat across open savannas;
now scaling the slippery <DW72>s of great mountains; now swimming the
chill waters of rushing streams; making his bed where night overtook
him, among the softly pattering forest denizens and the swarming
insect life of the dripping woods.His black skin glistened with
perspiration and the heavy dew wiped from the close-growing bush.With
one hand he leaned upon a young sapling cut for a staff.With the
other he incessantly swung his _machete_ to clear the dim trail.His
eyes were held fixed to the ground, to escape tripping over low vines,
and to avoid contact with crawling creatures of the jungle, whose
sting, inflicted without provocation, might so easily prove fatal.His
active mind sported the while among the fresh thoughts stimulated by.his journey, though back of all, as through a veil, the vision of
Carmen rose like the pillar of cloud which guided the wandering
Israel.Toil and danger fled its presence; and from it radiated a warm
glow which suffused his soul with light.When Jose arose that morning he was still puzzling over the logical
conclusions drawn from his premise of the evening before, and trying
to reconcile them with common sense and prevalent belief.In a way, he
seemed to be an explorer, carving a path to hidden wonders.Dona Maria
greeted him at the breakfast table with the simple announcement of
Rosendo's early departure.No sign of sorrow ruffled her quiet and
dignified demeanor.Nor did Carmen, who bounded into his arms, fresh
as a new-blown rose, manifest the slightest indication of anxiety
regarding Rosendo's welfare.Jose might not divine the thoughts which
the woman's placid exterior concealed.But for the child, he well knew
that her problem had been met and solved, and that she had laid it
aside with a trust in immanent good which he did not believe all the
worldly argument of pedant or philosopher could shake.cried Jose joyously, the meal finished."Just a look-in at the church, to get the boys started; and then
to devote the day to you, senorita!"Returning from the church some moments later, Jose found Carmen
bending over the fireplace, struggling to remove a heavy kettle from
the hot stones.he cried in apprehension, hurrying to her
assistance."You will burn your fingers, or hurt yourself!""Not unless you make me, Padre," Carmen quickly replied, rising and
confronting the priest with a demeanor whose every element spelled
rebuke."Well, I certainly shall not _make_ you!"But--"

"And nothing else can, for He is everywhere--isn't He?""Well--perhaps so," the priest retorted impatiently."But somehow
people get burnt and hurt just the same, and it is well to be
careful."Then she said quietly--

"I guess people burn and hurt themselves because they are afraid--don't
they?She tossed her brown curls as if in defiance of the thought of fear.Yet Jose somehow felt that she never really defied evil, but rather
met its suggestions with a firm conviction of its impotence in the
presence of immanent good.He checked the impulse to further
conversation.Bidding the child come to him as soon as possible to
begin the day's work, he went back to his own abode to reflect.He had previously said that this child should be brought up to know no
evil.And yet, was he not suggesting evil to her at every turn?Did
not his insistence upon the likelihood of hurting or burning herself
emphasize his own stalwart belief in evil as an immanent power and
contingency?Was he thus always to maintain a house divided against
itself?But some day she _must_ know, whether by instruction or dire
experience, that evil is a fact to be reckoned with!And as her
protector, it was his duty to--But he had not the heart to shatter
such beautiful confidence!Then he fell to wondering how long that pure faith could endure.Certainly not long if she were subjected to the sort of instruction
which the children of this world receive.But was it not his duty with
proper tutelage to make it last as long as possible?Was it not even
now so firmly grounded that it never could be shaken?He dwelt on the fact that nearly all children at some period early in
life commune with their concept of God.As a very
young child he had even felt himself on such terms of familiarity with
God that he could not sleep without first bidding Him good night.As a
young child, too, he had known no evil.Nor do any children, until
their perfect confidence in good is chilled by the false instruction
of parents and teachers, who parade evil before them in all its
hideous garb.for the baneful belief that years bring wisdom.How pitiable,
and how cruelly detrimental to the child are an ignorant parent's
assumptions of superiority!How tremendous the responsibility that now
lay at his own door!Yet no greater than that which lies at the door
of every parent throughout the world.It is sadly true, he reflected, that children are educated almost
entirely along material lines.Even in the imparting of religious
instruction, the spiritual is so tainted with materialism, and its
concomitants of fear and limitation, that the preponderance of faith
is always on the material side.Jose had believed that as he had grown
older in years he had lost faith.The quantity of his
faith remained fixed; but the quality had changed, through education,
from faith in good to faith in evil.And though trained as a priest of
God, in reality he had been taught wholly to distrust spiritual
power.But how could a parent rely on spiritual power to save a child about
to fall into the fire?Must not children be warned, and taught to
protect themselves from accident and disaster, as far as may be?True--yet, what causes accident and disaster?Has the parent's thought
aught to do with it?Can it be traced to the
universal acceptance of evil as a power, real and operative?Does
mankind's woeful lack of faith in good manifest itself in accident,
sickness, and death?A cry roused Jose from his revery.Hastening to the rear door he saw Dona Maria standing petrified,
looking in wide-eyed horror toward the lake.Jose followed her gaze,
and his blood froze.Carmen had been sent to meet the canoe that daily
supplied fresh water to the village from the Juncal river, which
flowed into the lake at the far north end.It had not yet arrived, and
she had sat down beside her jar at the water's edge, and was lost in
dreams as she looked out over the shimmering expanse.A huge crocodile
which had been lying in the shadow of a shale ledge had marked the
child, and was steadily creeping up behind her.The reptile was but a
few feet from her when Dona Maria, wondering at her delay, had gone to
the rear door and witnessed her peril.In a flash Jose recalled the tale related to him but a few days before
by Fidel Avila, who was working in the church."Padre," Fidel had said, "as soon as the church is ready I shall
offer a candle to good _Santa Catalina_ for protecting my sister.""She protected her from a crocodile a year ago, Padre.The girl had
gone to the lake to get water to wash our clothes, and as she sat in
the stern of the boat dipping the water, a great crocodile rose and
seized her arm.I heard her scream, and I was saying the rosary at the
time.And so I prayed to _Santa Catalina_ not to let the crocodile eat
her, and she didn't.""The crocodile pulled her under the water, Padre, and she was drowned.But he did not eat her; and we got her body and buried her here in the
cemetery._Sancta simplicitas!_ That such childish credulity might be turned
into proper channels!But there were times when fish were scarce in the lake.Then the
crocodiles became bold; and many babes had been seized and dragged off
by them, never to return.And more than one fisherman had asked Jose to invoke the Virgin in his
behalf.Nearer crept the monster toward the unsuspecting girl.Suddenly she
turned and looked squarely at it.She might almost have touched it
with her hand.For Jose it was one of those crises that "crowd
eternity into an hour."The child and the reptile might have been
painted against that wondrous tropic background.The great brute stood
bolt upright on its squat legs, its hideous jaws partly open.The girl
made no motion, but seemed to hold it with her steady gaze.Then--the
creature dropped; its jaws snapped shut; and it scampered into the
water.cried Jose, as he rushed to the girl and clasped her in
his arms."Forgive me if I ever doubted the miracles of Jesus!"Dona Maria turned and quietly resumed her work; but the man was
completely unstrung.Carmen asked in unfeigned surprise."I am not
afraid of crocodiles--are you?You couldn't be, if you knew that God
is everywhere.""But don't you know, child, that crocodiles have carried off--"

He checked himself."Nothing--nothing--I forgot--that's all.A--a--come, let us begin our
lessons now."But his mind refused to be held to the work.Finally he had to ask--he
could not help it."Carmen, what did you do?"Why, no, Padre--crocodiles don't talk!"And throwing her little head
back she laughed heartily at the absurd idea."No, Padre, I did nothing," the child persisted.He saw he must reach her thought in another way."Why did the
crocodile come up to you, Carmen?""Why--I guess because it loved me--I don't know.""And did you love it as you sat looking at it?""Y--yes--that is so, _chiquita_.I--I just thought I would ask you.And "perfect love casteth out
fear."What turned the monster from the girl and drove it into the
lake?Love, again, before which evil falls in sheer impotence?"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."There could be no question about it, _as long as
she knew no evil_.From arithmetic, they turned to the
English lesson.Next to perfection in her own Castilian, Jose felt
that this language was most important for her.And she delighted in
it, although her odd little pronunciations, and her vain attempts to
manipulate words to conform to her own ideas of enunciation brought
many a hearty laugh, in which she joined with enthusiasm.The
afternoon, as was his plan for future work, was devoted to narratives
of men and events, and to descriptions of places.It was a ceaseless
wonder to Jose how her mind absorbed his instruction."How readily you see these things, Carmen," he said, as he concluded
the work for the day.The remark seemed to start a train of thought within her mentality."Padre," she at length asked, "how do we see with our eyes?""It is very simple, _chiquita_," Jose replied."Here, let me draw a
picture of an eye."He quickly sketched a rough outline of the human organ of sight."Now," he began, "you know you cannot see in the dark, don't you?""In order to see, we must have light.""A--a--a--well, nothing--that is, light is just vibrations.The
pendulum of the old clock in Don Mario's store vibrates, you
know--moves back and forth."Now that chair there, for example, reflects
light, just as a mirror does.And these are
all of just a certain length, for vibrations of just that length and
moving up and down just so fast make light.The light enters the eye,
like this," tracing the rays on his sketch."It makes a little picture
of the chair on the back of the eye, where the optic nerve is
fastened.Now the light makes the little ends of this nerve vibrate,
too--move very rapidly.And that movement is carried along the nerve
to some place in the brain--to what we call the center of sight."But, Padre, is the picture of the chair carried on the nerve to the
brain?""Oh, no, _chiquita_, only vibrations.It is as if the nerve moved just
a little distance, but very, very fast, back and forth, or up and
down.""And no picture is carried to the brain?""No, there is just a vibration in the brain.""And that vibration makes us see the chair?"Then--

"Padre dear, I don't believe it.""Well, Padre, what is it that sees the chair, anyway?""Is the mind up there in the brain?""Well--no, we can't say that it is.""A--a--well, no place in particular--that is, it is right here all the
time.""Well, then, when the mind wants to see the chair does it have to
climb up into the brain and watch that little nerve wiggle?"The man was at a loss for an answer.Carmen suddenly crumpled the
sketch in her small hand and smiled up at him."Padre dear, I don't believe our outside eyes see anything.We just
think they do, don't we?"Carmen's weird heron was
stalking in immense dignity past the house."I think Cantar-las-horas is getting ready to sing the Vespers,
_chiquita_.And so Dona Maria probably needs you now.We will talk
more about the eye to-morrow."By the light of his sputtering candle that night Jose sat with elbows
propped on the table, his head clasped in his hands, and a sketch of
the human eye before him.In his confident attempt to explain to
Carmen the process of cognition he had been completely baffled.Certainly, light coming from an object enters the eye and casts a
picture upon the retina.He had often seen the photographic camera
exhibit the same phenomenon.The law of the impenetrability of matter
had to be set aside, of course--or else light must be pure vibration,
without a material vibrating concomitant.Then, too, it was plain that
the light in some way communicated its vibration to the little
projecting ends of the optic nerve, which lie spread out over the rear
inner surface of the eye.And equally patent that this vibration is in
some way taken up by the optic nerve and transmitted to the center of
sight in the brain.He laughed again at Carmen's
pertinent question about the mind climbing up into the brain to see
the vibrating nerve.But was it so silly a presumption, after all?Is
the mind within the brain, awaiting in Stygian darkness the advent of
the vibrations which shall give it pictures of the outside world?Or
is the mind outside of the brain, but still slavishly forced to look
at these vibrations of the optic nerve and then translate them into
terms of things without?What could a vibrating nerve suggest to a
well-ordered mind, anyway?He might as logically wave a piece of meat
and expect thereby to see a world!Why does not the foolish mind leave the brain and look at the picture
on the retina?Or why does it not throw off its shackles and look
directly at the object to be cognized, instead of submitting to
dependence upon so frail a thing as fleshly eyes and nerves?As he mused and sketched, unmindful of the voracious mosquitoes or the
blundering moths that momentarily threatened his light, it dawned
slowly upon him that the mind's awareness of material objects could
not possibly depend upon the vibrations of pieces of nerve tissue, so
minute as to be almost invisible to the unaided sight.Still more
absurd did it appear to him that his own mind, of which he might
justly boast tremendous powers, could be prostituted to such a degree
that its knowledge of things must be served to it on waving pieces of
flesh.And how about the other senses--touch, hearing?Did the ear hear, or
the hand feel?He had always accepted the general belief that man is
dependent absolutely upon the five physical senses for his knowledge
of an outside world.And now a little thought showed that from these
five senses man could not possibly receive anything more than a series
of disconnected vibrations!And, going a step further, anything that
the mind infers from these vibrations is unquestionably inferred
_without a particle of outside authority_!A tremendous idea seemed to be knocking
at the portal of his mentality.Assuredly nothing but the contents of itself.But the contents of mind are thoughts, ideas, mental things.Then the mind knows
not things, but its _thoughts of things_.And instead of seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling solid material objects, the
mind sees, hears, smells, tastes, and feels--what?Is only what
the mind _believes_ it to be.But surely his mind saw an outer world
through the medium of his eye!His mind saw only its own concepts
of an outer world--and these concepts, being mental, might take on
whatever hue and tinge his mind decreed.In other words, instead of
seeing a world of matter, he was seeing only a mental picture of a
world.And that picture was in his own mind, _and formed by that
mind_!The man seized his hat and hurried out into the night.He walked
rapidly the full length of the town.His mind was wrestling with
stupendous thoughts.An hour later he returned to his house, and seizing a pencil, wrote
rapidly: Matter is mental.We do not see or feel matter, but we
_think_ it.It is formed and held as a mental concept in every human
mind.The material universe is but the human mind's concept of a
universe, and can only be this mentality's translation to itself of
infinite Mind's purely mental Creation."And so," he commented aloud, sitting back and regarding his writing,
"all my miserable life I have been seeing only my own thoughts!And I
have let them use me and color my whole outlook!"He extinguished the candle and threw himself, fully dressed, upon his
bed.CHAPTER 10


Momentous changes, of far-reaching effect, had come swiftly upon Jose
de Rincon during the last few days, changes which were destined after
much vacillation and great mental struggle to leave a reversed
outlook.But let no one think these changes fortuitous or casual, the
chance result of a new throw of Fate's dice.Jose, seeing them dimly
outlined, did not so regard them, but rather looked upon them as the
working of great mental laws, still unknown, whose cumulative effect
had begun a transformation in his soul.How often in his seminary days
he had pondered the scripture, "He left not Himself without witness."How often he had tried to see the hopeless confusion of good and evil
in the world about him as a witness to the One who is of purer eyes
than to behold evil.And he had at last abandoned his efforts in
despair.Yet that there must be something behind the complex phenomena
which men call life, he knew.Call it what he would--law, force, mind,
God, or even X, the great unknown quantity for which life's intricate
equations must be solved--yet _something_ there was in it all which
endured in an eternal manifestation.But could that something endure
in an expression both good and evil?He had long since abandoned all study of the Bible.But in these last
days there had begun to dawn upon him the conviction that within that
strange book were locked mysteries which far transcended the wildest
imaginings of the human mind.With it came also the certainty that
Jesus had been in complete possession of those sacred mysteries.There
could be no question now that his mission had been woefully
misunderstood, often deliberately misinterpreted, and too frequently
maliciously misused by mankind.His greatest sayings, teachings so
pregnant with truth that, had they been rightfully appropriated by
men, ere this would have dematerialized the universe and revealed the
spiritual kingdom of God, had been warped by cunning minds into crude
systems of theology and righteous shams, behind which the world's
money-changers and sellers of doves still drove their wicked traffic
and offered insults to Truth in the temple of the Most High.Oh, how he now lamented the narrowness and the intellectual
limitations with which his seminary training had been hedged about!The world's thought had been a closed book to him.Because of his
morbid honesty, only such pages reached his eye as had passed the
bigoted censorship of Holy Church.His religious instruction had been
served to him with the seal of infallible authority.Of other systems
of theology he had been permitted only the Vatican's biased
interpretation, for the curse of Holy Church rested upon them.Of
current philosophical thought, of Bible criticism and the results of
independent scriptural research, he knew practically nothing--little
beyond what the explorer had told him in their memorable talks a few
weeks before in Cartagena.But, had he known it, these had unbarred
the portals of his mind to the reception of the new ideas which, under
a most powerful stimulus, were now flowing so steadily through them.To meet with a child of tender years who knows no evil is, after all,
a not uncommon thing.For, did we but realize it, the world abounds in
them.They are its glory, its radiance--until they are taught to heed
the hiss of the serpent.Their pure knowledge of immanent good would
endure--ah, who may say how long?--did not we who measure our wisdom
by years forbid them with the fear-born mandate: "Thus far!"What
manner of being was he who said, "Suffer little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not?"Oh, ye parents, who forbid your little ones
to come to the Christ by hourly heaping up before them the limitations
of fear and doubt, of faith in the power and reality of sin and evil,
of false instruction, and withering material beliefs!Would not the
Christ pray for you to-day, "Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do"?When Jose met Carmen she was holding steadfastly to her vision--the
immanence and allness of God.Each day she created the morrow; and she
knew to a certainty that it would be happy.Would he, clanking his
fetters of worldly beliefs, be the one to shatter her illusion, if
illusion it be?Nay, rather should he seek to learn of her, if; haply
she be in possession of that jewel for which he had searched a vain
lifetime.Already from the stimulus which his intercourse with the
child had given his mental processes there had come a sudden
liberation of thought.Into his freer mentality the Christ-idea now
flowed.Mankind complain that they cannot "prove" God.But Paul long since
declared emphatically that to prove Him the human mind must be
transformed.In the light of the great ideas which had dawned upon him
in the past few days--the nature of God as mind, unlimited, immanent,
eternal, and good; and the specious character of the five physical
senses, which from the beginning have deluded mankind into the false
belief that through them comes a true knowledge of the cosmos--Jose's
mentality was being formed anew.Hegel, delving for truth in a world of illusion, summed up a lifetime
of patient research in the pregnant statement, "The true knowledge of
God begins when we know that things as they are have no truth in
them."The testimony of the five physical senses constitutes "things
as they are."But--if Jose's reasoning be not illogical--the human
mind receives no testimony from these senses, which, at most, can
offer but insensate and meaningless vibrations in a pulpy mass called
the brain.The true knowledge of God, for which Jose had yearned and
striven, begins only when men turn from the mesmeric deception of the
physical senses, and learn that there is something, knowable and
usable, behind them, and of whose existence they give not the
slightest intimation.The church edifice was so far put in order that Jose
found no reason for not holding service on the morrow.He therefore
announced the fact, and told Carmen that he must devote the day to
preparation.Seeking the
solitude of his house, Jose returned to his Bible.Not, as in the codes
of men, God last, and after every material expedient has been
exhausted--but "to begin with."Jose could not deny that for all that
exists there is a cause.Nor can the human mind object to the
implication that the cause of an existing universe must itself
continue to exist.Even less can it deny that the framer of the
worlds, bound together in infinite space by the unbreakable cables of
infinite laws, must be omnipotent.And to retain its omnipotence, that
cause must be perfect--absolutely good--every whit pure, sound, and
harmonious; for evil is demonstrably self-destructive.And, lastly,
what power could operate thus but an infinite intelligence, an
all-inclusive mind?Now let the human mentality continue its own reasoning, if so be that
it hold fast to fact and employ logical processes.If "like
produces like"--and from thistles figs do not grow--that which mind
creates must be mental.And a good cause can produce only a good
effect.So the ancient writer, "And God saw every thing that He had
made, and, behold, it was very good."Yes, mused Jose, for inspiration is but the flow of truth into one's
mentality--stopped not until he had said, "So God created man in
His own image"--

Wait!--"in the image of God"--not in the image of matter, not in the
likeness of evil--"created He him."But what had now become of that
man?So Jesus, centuries later, "God is spirit," and, "That which is born
of the Spirit is spirit."Or, man--true man--expresses mind, God, and
is His eternal and spiritual likeness and reflection.But, to make
this still clearer to torpid minds, Paul wrote, "For in Him we live,
and move, and have our being."Then he added, "To be spiritually
minded is life."As if he would say, True life is the _consciousness_
of spiritual things only.Is human life aught but a series of states of consciousness?And is
consciousness aught but mental activity?--for when the mind's activity
ceases, the man dies."It is the activity of thought," said Jose aloud, "that makes us
believe that fleshly eyes see and ears hear.We see only our thoughts;
and in some way they become externalized as our environment."Thought builds images, or mental
concepts, within the mind.These are the thought-objects which mankind
believe they see as material things in an outer world.And so the
world is within, not without.Jesus must have known this when he said,
"The kingdom of heaven is within you."Did he not know the tremendous
effects of thought when he said, "For as a man thinketh, so is he"?In
other words, a man builds his own mental image of himself, and conveys
it to the fellow-minds about him.His eye fell upon the
warning of Jeremiah, "Hear, O earth, behold I will bring evil
upon this people, _even the fruit of their thoughts_!"he
needed no warning to show him now the dire results of his own past
wrong thinking.Evil is but wrong thinking wrought out in life
experience.And so the chief of sins is the breaking of the very
first Commandment, the belief in other powers than God, the
infinite mind that framed the spiritual universe."But we simply can't help breaking the Commandment," cried Jose, "when
we see nothing but evil about us!And yet--we are seeing only the
thoughts in our own minds.Jose was quite ready to concede a mental basis for everything; to
believe that even sin is but the thought of sin, false thought
regarding God and His Creation.But, if God is all-inclusive mind, He
must be _the only thinker_.No, for then were God maintaining a
house divided against itself.And that would mean His ultimate
dissolution.Infinite, omnipotent mind is by very logic _compelled_ to be perfect.Then the thoughts issuing from that mind must be good.So it must
follow that evil thoughts come from another source.But if God is
infinite, there is no other source, no other cause.Then there is but
the single alternative left--_evil thoughts must be unreal_.What was it that the explorer had said to him in regard to Spencer's
definition of reality?But, for that matter,
evil seems to be just as enduring as good, and to run its course as
undeviatingly.After all, what is it that says there is evil?But that again reduces to the thought of evil, for
men see only their thoughts.These so-called senses say that the world
is flat--that the sun circles the earth--that objects diminish in size
with distance.Jesus said that evil, or the
"devil," was "a liar and the father of lies."Then the testimony of
the physical senses to evil--and there is no other testimony to its
existence and power--is a lie.Reason has had
to correct sense-testimony in the field of astronomy and show that the
earth is not flat.Where, indeed, has reason not had to correct
sense-testimony?For Jose could now see that all such testimony was
essentially false."Things as they are have no truth in them."In
other words, sense-testimony is false belief.And the
habitat of a lie is--nowhere.Did the world by clinging to evil and
trying to make something of it, to classify it and reduce it to
definite rules and terms, thus tend to make it real?And
as long as the world held evil to be real, could evil be overcome?He believed he was close to the discovery
of that solid basis of truth on which to stand while teaching Carmen.At any rate, her faith, which he could no longer believe to be
baseless illusion, would not be shattered by him.CHAPTER 11


Two weeks after his arrival in Simiti Jose conducted his first
services in the ancient church.After four years of silence, the rusty
bell sent out its raucous call from the old tower that still morning
and announced the revival of public worship.As the priest stepped from the sacristy and approached the altar his
heart experienced a sudden sinking.Before him his little flock bowed
reverently and expectantly.Looking out at them, a lump rose in his
throat.He was their pastor, and daily his love had grown for these
kindly, simple folk.And now, what would he not have given could he
have stretched forth his hands, as did the Master, to heal them of
their ills and lift them out of the shadows of ignorance!Ah, if he
could have thrown aside the mummery and pagan ceremonialism which he
was there to conduct, and have sat down among them, as Jesus was wont
to do on those still mornings in Galilee!Instead, he stood before
them an apostate vassal of Rome, hypocritically using the Church to
shield and maintain himself in Simiti while he reared away from her
the child Carmen.He had heard the call; and he had answered,
"Master, here am I."And now he was occupying, while waiting to be
led, step by step, out of his cruelly anomalous position and into his
rightful domain.Nay, he thought he would
have been a traitor to all that was best and holiest within himself
had he done otherwise.In the name of the Church he would serve these
humble people.And honoring
Christ, he could not dishonor the Church.Jose's conduct of the Mass was perfunctory.Vainly he strove to hold
in thought the symbolism of the service, the offering of Christ as a
propitiation for the world's sins.But gradually the folly of Milton's
extravagant, wild dream, which the poet clothed in such imperishable
beauty, stole over him and blinded this vision.He saw the Holy
Trinity sitting in solemn council in the courts of heaven.He heard
their perplexed discussion of the ravages of Satan in the terrestrial
paradise below.He heard the Father pronounce His awful curse upon
mankind.And he beheld the Son rise and with celestial magnanimity
offer himself as the sacrificial lamb, whose blood should wash away
the serpent-stain of sin.He had seen her, as he looked out over
his people, sitting with Dona Maria, arrayed in a clean white frock,
and swinging her plump bare legs beneath the bench, while wonder and
amazement peered out from her big brown eyes as she followed his every
move.What would such things mean to her, whose God was ever-present
good?What did they mean to the priest himself, who was beginning to
see Him as infinite, divine mind, knowing no evil--the One whose
thoughts are not as ours?He took up the holy water and sprinkled the assemblage."Purge me with
hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than
snow."But how is the human mind purged of error?And does the infinite mind purge the thought of men in any other way?His mind was full as he took up the Missal."_Kyrie Eleison_, _Christe
Eleison_."With a tug he pulled his mind back to the work before
him.But why was he invoking clemency from One who knows no evil?Heretofore he had always thought that God knew evil, that He must
recognize it, and that He strove Himself to overcome it.But if God
knew evil, then evil were real and eternal!Dreamily he began to
intone the _Gloria in Excelsis Deo_.All hail, thou infinite mind,
whose measureless depths mortal man has not even begun to sound!His
soul could echo that strain forever.He turned to the Lesson and read: "But there went up a mist from the
earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground."The mist of error watered the false
thought--the one lie about God--and out of it formed the man of flesh,
the false concept which is held in the minds of mortals.Aye, it was
the lie, posing as the Lord of creation, which had formed its false
man out of the dust of the ground, and had forced it upon the
acceptance of mankind!Jose turned back and read the whole of the
first chapter of Genesis, where he felt that he stood upon truth.The tapers on the altar flickered fitfully.The disturbed bats
blundered among the rafters overhead.Outside, the dusty roads burned
with a white glare.Within, he and the people were worshiping God."God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth."Jose recited the Nicene creed, with the thought that its man-made
fetters had bound the Christian world for dreary centuries.Then, the
Preface and Canon concluded, he pronounced the solemn words of
consecration which turned the bread and wine before him into the flesh
and blood of Christ Jesus.He looked at the wafer and the chalice long
and earnestly.He--Jose de Rincon--mortal, human, a weakling among
weaklings--could he command God by his "_Hoc est enim corpus meum_" to
descend from heaven to this altar?Could he so invoke the power of the
Christ as to change bread and wine into actual flesh and blood?And
yet, with all the priestly powers which Holy Church had conferred upon
him, he could not heal a single bodily ill, nor avert one human
misfortune!Well have you avenged yourself upon those who wrought
your fall, for in the death conflict you left the taint of your
paganism upon them, and it endures in their sons even to this fair
day!Jose deferred his sermon until the close of the service.He wanted
time to think over again what he could say to these simple people.They sat before him, dull, inert, yet impressionable--bare of feet, or
wearing hempen sandals, and clad in cheap cottons and calicos, with
here and there a flash of bright ribbon among the women, and
occasionally a parasol of brilliant hue, which the owner fondly
clasped, while impatiently awaiting the close of the service that she
might proudly parade it.A few of the men wore starched linen shirts,
but without collars.The Alcalde, with his numerous family, and the
family of Don Felipe Alcozer, sat well in front.The former regarded
Jose expectantly, as the priest turned to deliver his simple sermon."My children," Jose began, "when the good man whom we call the Saviour
sent his disciples out into the world he told them to preach the
gospel and heal the sick.We have no record that he asked them to do
more, for that included his whole mission.And, as I believe myself to have been led to you, so I shall preach
what I believe to be given me by the great Father of us all.I shall
teach you the Christ as I comprehend him.I would I could heal the
sick as well.But the gift of healing which Jesus bestowed has been
lost to mankind."Then he
continued:

"I am your servant, and your friend.I want you to believe that
whatever I do in your midst and whatever I say to you follows only
after I have prayerfully considered your welfare.As time has passed I
have seemed to see things in a clearer light than before.What I may
see in the future I shall point out to you as you are able to
understand me.To that end we must suffer many things to be as they
are for the present, for I am learning with you.I shall give you a
single thought to take with you to-day.Jesus once said, 'As a man
thinketh, so is he.'I want you to remember that, if you would be well
and happy and prosperous, you must think only about good things.Some
day you will see why this is so.But go back now to your _fincas_ and
your fishing, to your little stores and your humble homes, firmly
resolving never to think a bad thought, whether about yourself or your
neighbor.And pray for yourselves and me--"

He looked off into the gloom overhead.Again he seemed to hear the Man
of Galilee: "Ask and ye shall receive.""And, my children--"

He thought suddenly of Carmen and her visits to the shales.His face
shone for a moment with a new light.

"--let your prayers be no mere requests that God will bless us, but
rather let them be statements that He is infinite good, and that He
cannot do otherwise than give us all we need.No, I ask not that you
intercede for me; nor shall I do so for you.But I do ask that you
join with me in trying to realize that God is good; that He loves us
as His dear children; and that He is daily, hourly pouring out His
inexhaustible goodness upon us.We shall all see that goodness when we
learn to think no evil."His eyes rested upon Carmen as he spoke these last words.Then with a
simple invocation he dismissed the congregation.The Alcalde carried Jose off to dinner with him, much against the
inclination of the priest, who preferred to be alone.But the Alcalde
was the chief influence in the town, and it was policy to cultivate
him."The blessed Virgin shows that she has not forgotten Simiti, Padre, by
sending you here," said Don Mario, when they were seated in the shade
of the ample _patio_."Yes, friend," with just a
trace of amusement in his voice."It was doubtless because of the
Virgin that I was directed here," he replied, thinking of Carmen."Excellent advice that you gave the people, Padre; but it is not
likely they understood you, poor fools!Now if Padre Diego had been
preaching he would have ranted like a windstorm; but he would have
made an impression.I am afraid soft words will not sink into their
thick skulls."Dinner was served in the open, during which the Alcalde chattered
volubly.Jose knew that for
some time he had been edging toward the question."_Quien sabe, senor!_" replied the priest, with a careless shrug of
his shoulders.he is old to prospect for gold--and alone, too!""You are all alike when it
comes to money.Padre Diego was up to the same schemes; and before he
left he had a hat full of titles to mines.""But I am not seeking to acquire mineral property!"exclaimed Jose
with some aspersion.Then you had nothing to do with Rosendo's trip?""_Na_, Padre, let us be confidential," said the Alcalde, hitching his
chair closer to the priest."Look, I understand why Rosendo went into
the Guamoco country--but you can trust me to say nothing about it.Only, Padre, if he should find the mine he will have trouble enough
to hold it.You know the denouncement
papers must go through my hands, and I send them to Cartagena for
registration."He sat back in his chair with a knowing look."There is only one man here to be afraid of," he resumed; "and that is
Don Felipe Alcozer; although he may never return to Simiti."Then:

"Now, Padre, let us have some understanding about interests in the
mine, should Rosendo find it.The mine will be useless to us unless we
work it, for there is no one to buy it from us.To work it, we must
have a stamp-mill, or _arrastras_.The Antioquanians are skilled in
the making of wooden stamp-mills; but one would cost perhaps two
thousand _pesos oro_.Nobody here can furnish so much money but Don
Felipe.I will arrange with him for a suitable interest.And I will
fix all the papers so that the title will be held by us three.Rosendo
is only a _peon_.You can pay him for his trouble, and he need not
have an interest."Jose breathed easier while this recital was in progress.So Don Mario
believed Rosendo to have gone in search of the lost mine, La Libertad!Good; for Cartagena would soon get the report, and his own tenure of
the parish would be rendered doubly sure thereby.The monthly greasing
of Wenceslas' palm with what Rosendo might extract from the Guamoco
sands, coupled with the belief that Jose was maintaining a man in the
field in search of Don Ignacio's lost mine, rendered Cartagena's
interference a very remote contingency.He almost laughed as he
replied:

"Rosendo will doubtless prospect for some months, Don Mario, and I am
sure we shall have plenty of time to discuss any arrangement of
interests later, should occasion arise.When the afternoon heat began to wane, Jose left the Alcalde and
returned to his cottage.Since the service of the morning he had been
fighting a constantly deepening sense of depression.An awful
loneliness now gripped his heart, and dank gloom was again sweeping
through the corridors of his soul.God, what a sacrifice, to remain
buried in that dismal town!His continuance in the priesthood of an
abjured faith was violative of every principle of honesty!The time
would come when the mask of hypocrisy would have to be raised, and the
resultant exposure would be worse then than open apostasy now!He entered his dreary little abode and threw himself upon a chair.There had been no reaction like this for days.He looked out into the
deserted street.Mud hovels; ragged, thatched roofs; lowly _peones_
drowsing away life's little hour within!There was scarcely a book in
the town.Few of its inhabitants could even read or write.Culture,
education, refinement--all wanting.Nothing but primal existence--the
barest necessities of real life.He had been a
fool all his years!He would throw everything to the winds and go out
into the world to live his life as it had been intended he should live
it.He would send his resignation to the Bishop to-morrow.Then he
would hire Juan to take him to Bodega Central; and the few _pesos_ he
had left would get him to Barranquilla.There he would work until he
had earned enough for his passage to the great States up north, of
which the explorer had told such wonderful tales.Once there, he could
teach, or--

His thought turned to Rosendo.He saw him, bent with age, and wearied
with toil, alone in the awful solitude of the jungle, standing knee
deep in the cold mountain water, while from early dawn till sunset he
incessantly swung the heavy _batea_ to concentrate the few flakes of
precious gold it might contain.And the old man was facing years of
just such loneliness and heavy toil--facing them gladly.Was she worth such sacrifice as he and Rosendo
were making?If he
betrayed Rosendo's confidence and fled like a coward now, leaving her
to fall into the sooty hands of men like Padre Diego, to be crushed,
warped, and squeezed into the molds of Holy Church, could he ever
again face his fellow-men?he cried in a
voice that echoed through the barren rooms.He smote his chest and
paced the floor.It was the same simple melody she had sung the day he awoke from his
fever.Then--

  "Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with
        might,
  Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of
        sight."CHAPTER 12


In the days that followed, while at times Jose still struggled
desperately against the depression of his primal environment, and
against its insidious suggestions of license, Carmen moved before him
like the shechinah of Israel, symbolizing the divine presence.When
the dark hours came and his pronounced egoism bade fair to overwhelm
him; when his self-centered thought clung with the tenacity of a
limpet to his dreary surroundings and his unfilled longings; when
self-condemnation and self-pity rived his soul, and despair of solving
life's intricate problems settled again like a pall upon him, he
turned to her.Under the soft influence of her instinct for primitive
good, he was learning, even if slowly, to jettison his heavily laden
soul, and day by day to ride the tossing waves of his stormy thought
with a lighter cargo.Her simple faith in immanent good was working
upon his mind like a spiritual catharsis, to purge it of its clogging
beliefs.Her unselfed love flowed over him like heavenly balm, salving
the bleeding wounds of the spiritual mayhem which he had suffered at
the violent hands of Holy Church's worldly agents.Carmen's days were filled to the brim with a measure of joy that
constantly overflowed upon all among whom she moved.Her slight
dependence upon her impoverished material environment, her contempt
of its _ennui_, were constant reminders to Jose that heaven is but
a state of mind.Even in desolate Simiti, life to her was an
endless series of delightful experiences, of wonderful surprises
in the discovery of God's presence everywhere.Her enthusiasms were
always ardent and inexhaustible.Sparkling animation and abounding
vitality characterized her every movement.Her thought was free,
unstrained, natural, and untrammeled by those inherited and educated
beliefs in evil in which Jose had early been so completely swamped.In worldly knowledge she was the purest novice; and the engaging
_naivete_ with which she met the priest's explanations of historical
events and the motives from which they sprang charmed him beyond
measure, and made his work with her a constant delight.Her sense of
humor was keen, and her merriment when his recitals touched her
risibility was extravagant.She laughed at danger, laughed at the
weaknesses and foibles of men, when he told of the political and
social ambitions which stirred mankind in the outside world.But he
knew that her merriment proceeded not from an ephemeral sense of
the ludicrous, but from a righteous appraisal of the folly and
littleness of those things for which the world so sorely strives.And daily the little maid wrapped herself about his heart.Daily her
wondrous love coiled its soft folds tighter around him, squeezing from
his atrabilious soul, drop by drop, its sad taciturnity and inherent
morbidness, that it might later fill his empty life with a spiritual
richness which he had never known before.On the day following the opening of the church Carmen had asked
many questions.It was the first religious service she had ever
voluntarily attended.To her former queries regarding the function
of the church edifice, Rosendo had vouchsafed but one reply: it was
the house of God, and in it the people used to gather to learn of Him.But she protested that she had no need of the musty, ramshackle,
barn-like old building as a locus in which to center her thought upon
God.She walked with Him, and she much preferred the bright, sunlit
out-of-doors in which to commune with Him.Jose explained the need
of a central gathering place as a shelter from the hot sun.But the
images--the pictures of Saints and Virgin--and the Mass itself?"They are what the people are accustomed to, dear child, to direct
their thought toward God," he explained."And we will use them until
we can teach them something better."He had omitted from the church
service as far as possible the collects and all invocations addressed
to the Virgin and the Saints, and had rendered it short and extremely
simple.Carmen seemed satisfied with his explanation, and with his
insistence that, for the sake of appearance, she attend the Sunday
services.He would trust her God to guide them both.Jose and the child dwelt
together apart from the world, in a universe purely mental.As he
taught her, she hung upon his every word, and seized the proffered
tutelage with avidity.Often, after the day's work, Jose, in his
customary strolls about the little town, would come across the girl in
the doorway of a neighboring house, with a group of wide-eyed
youngsters about her, relating again the wonder-tales which she had
gathered from him.Marvelous tales they were, too, of knight and
_hidalgo_, of court and camp, of fairies, pyxies, gnomes and sprites,
of mossy legend and historic fact, bubbling from the girl's childish
lips with an engaging _naivete_ of interpretation that held the man
enchanted.Even the schoolmaster, who had besought Jose in vain to
turn Carmen over to him, was often a spellbound listener at these
little gatherings.The result was that in a short time a delegation, headed by the
Alcalde himself, waited upon Jose and begged him to lecture to the
people of Simiti in the church building at least two or three evenings
a week upon places and people he had seen in the great world of which
they knew nothing.Jose's eyes were moist as he looked at the great,
brawny men, stout of heart, but simple as children.He grieved to give
up his evenings, for he had formed the habit of late of devoting them
to the study of his Bible, and to meditation on those ideas which had
so recently come to him.But the appeal from these innocent, untutored
people again quenched the thought of self, and he bade them be assured
that their request was granted.The new ideas which had found entrance into Jose's liberated mentality
in the past few days had formed a basis on which he was not afraid to
stand while teaching Carmen; and his entire instruction was
thenceforth  by them.He knew not why, in all the preceding
years, such ideas had not come to him before.But he was to learn,
some day, that his previous tenacious clinging to evil as a reality,
together with his material beliefs and his worldly intellectuality,
had stood as barriers at the portals of his thought, and kept the
truth from entering.His mind had been already full--but its contents
were unbelief, fear, the conviction of evil as real and operative, and
the failure to know God as immanent, omnipotent and perfect mind, to
whom evil is forever unknown and unreal.Pride, egoism, and his morbid
sense of honesty had added their portion to the already impassable
obstruction at the gateway of his thought.And so the error had been
kept within, the good without.The "power of the Lord" had not been
absent; but it had remained unapplied.Thus he had wandered through
the desolate wilderness; but yet sustained and kept alive, that he
should not go down to the pit.Jose's days were now so crowded that he was forced to borrow heavily
from the night.The Alcalde continued his unctuous flattery, and the
priest, in turn, cultivated him assiduously.To that official's query
as to the restitution of the confessional in the church, the priest
replied that he could spare time to hear only such confessions from
his flock as might be necessary to elicit from him the advice or
assistance requisite for their needs.He was there to help them solve
their life problems, not to pry into their sacred secrets; and their
confessions must relate only to their necessities.The Alcalde went away with a puzzled look.Of a truth a new sort of
priest had now to be reckoned with in Simiti--a very different sort
from Padre Diego.In the first days of Jose's incumbency he found many serious matters
to adjust.He had learned from Rosendo that not half the residents of
Simiti were married to the consorts with whom they lived, and that
many of the children who played in the streets did not know who their
fathers were.So prevalent was this evil condition that the custom
among the men of having their initials embroidered upon the bosoms of
their shirts was extended to include the initial of the mother's
family name.Jose had questioned Rosendo as to the meaning of the
letters R. A. S. upon his shirt."The S, Padre, is the initial of my mother's family name.I am Rosendo
Ariza, son of the daughter of Saurez.My parents were married by a
priest.But half the people of Simiti have never been really
married."Fidel Avila was living with
a woman, by whom he had three children.The priest summoned him to the
parish house."Fidel," he questioned sternly, "Jacinta, the woman you live with, is
your wife?""Yes, _Senor Padre_.""But was there a priest here when you began to live with Jacinta?"The _Cura_, Don Diego Polo, was here.""Then why were you not married by him?Do you not know how wicked it
is to live as you are doing?"Yes, Padre, and I asked the _Cura_, Don Diego, to marry us.But he
charged twenty _pesos oro_ for doing it; and I could not afford it.And so we decided to live together without the
marriage."He knew that the Church recognized no marriage
unless it were performed by a priest.The civil magistrate had no
jurisdiction in such a case.And a former priest's rapacity had
resulted in forcing illegitimacy upon half the children of this
benighted hamlet, because of their parents' inability to afford the
luxury of a canonical marriage."Fidel, were your father and mother married?"Only a few people in Guamoco can afford to pay
to be married.The men and women live together, perhaps for all time,
perhaps for only a few months.If a man wishes to leave his woman and
live with another, he does so.If there are children, the woman always
has to keep and care for them.""And could you leave Jacinta if you wished, and live with another
woman?""And she would have to lake care of your children?""_Hombre!_ But that will do, Fidel."Oh, the sordid greed of those who abuse their sacred commission!What
punishment is mete for such as exploit these lowly folk in the name of
religion!Jose strode off to consult the Alcalde."Don Mario, the men in Simiti who are living with women have _got_ to
be married to them!I shall make a canvass of the town
at once!""_Costumbre_, Padre._Costumbre del pais!_ It is a final answer all through South America.No matter how unreasonable a thing may be, if it is the custom of the
country it is a Medean law."But you know this is subversive of Church discipline!""Look you, Don Mario," he added suggestively, "you and I are
to work together, are we not?"The Alcalde blinked his pig eyes, but thought hard about La Libertad._"Cierto, Senor Padre!"Then I demand that you summon before me every man and woman who are
living together unmarried."With a thought single to his own future advantage, the wary Alcalde
complied.Within the week following this interview Jose married twenty
couples, and without charge.These he
took and immediately turned over to Don Mario as treasurer of the
parish.Those couples who refused to be married were forced by the
Alcalde to separate.Packing his few household effects upon his back, and
muttering imprecations against the priest, Gomez set out for the
hills, still followed by his woman, with a babe slung over her
shoulders and two naked children toddling at her bare heels.Verily, the ancient town was being profoundly stirred by the man who
had sought to find his tomb there.Gradually the people lost their
suspicions and distrust, bred of former bitter experience with
priests, and joined heartily with Jose to ameliorate the social status
of the place.His sincere love for them, and his utter selflessness,
secured their confidence, and ere his first month among them closed,
he had won them, almost to a man.Meantime, six weeks had passed since Rosendo had departed to take up
his lonely task of self-renouncing love.Then one day he returned,
worn and emaciated, his great frame shaking like a withered leaf in a
chill blast."It is the _terciana_, Padre," he said, as he sank shuddering upon
his bed.I went as far as Tachi--fifty
leagues from Simiti--and there the fever overtook me.I have been
eight days coming back; and day before yesterday I ran out of
food.Last evening I found a wild melon at the side of the trail.A
coral snake struck at me when I reached for it, but he hit my
_machete_ instead._Caramba!_"

Jose pressed his wet hand, while Dona Maria laid damp cloths upon his
burning forehead."The streams are washed out, Padre," Rosendo continued sadly."I
worked at Colorado, Popales, and Tambora.But I got no more than five
_pesos_ worth.And that will not pay for half of my supplies.It is
there in a little bag," pointing to his soaked and muddy kit.Jose's heart was wrung by the suffering and disappointment of the old
man.Sadly he carried the little handful of gold flakes to Don Mario,
and then returned to the exhausted Rosendo.All through the night the sick man tossed and moaned.Then Jose and Dona Maria became genuinely alarmed.The
toil and exposure had been too much for Rosendo at his advanced age.In his delirium he talked brokenly of the swamps through which he had
floundered, for he had taken the trail in the wet season, and fully
half of its one hundred and fifty miles of length was oozy and all but
impassable bog.Don Mario shook his head
as he stood over him."I have seen many in that condition, Padre, and they didn't wake up!If we had quinine, perhaps he might be saved.But there isn't a flake
in the town.""Then send Juan to Bodega Central at once for it!""I doubt if he would find it there either, Padre.However, Juan cannot make the trip in less than two days.And I fear
Rosendo will not last that long."Dona Maria sat by the bedside, dumb with grief.The Alcalde had dispatched
Juan down to the river to signal any steamer that he should meet, if
perchance he might purchase a few grains of the only drug that could
save the sick man.Carmen had absented herself during the day; but
she returned in time to assist Dona Maria with the evening meal,
after which she went at once to her bed.Late at night, when the sympathizing townsmen had sorrowfully departed
and Jose had induced Dona Maria to seek a few moments rest on her
_petate_ in the living room, Carmen climbed quietly out of her bed and
came to where the priest sat alone with the unconscious Rosendo.Jose was bending over the delirious man."Oh, if Jesus were only here
now!"Jose looked down into the little face beside him.The little head
shook as if to emphasize the words.But he put his arm about the child and drew her to
him."_Chiquita_, why do you say that?""Because God doesn't die, you know," she quickly replied."And we are
like Him, Padre, aren't we?""But He calls us to Him, _chiquita_.And--I guess--He is--is calling
your padre Rosendo now."Does God kill mankind in order to give them life?And--

"Why, no, Padre," returned the innocent child."He is always here; and
we are always with Him, you know.He can not call people away from
where He is, can He?"_Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world._ The
Christ-principle, the saving truth about God and man, is ever present
in an uncomprehending world.Jose knew that there was no material dependence now.Something told
him that Rosendo lay dying.There was no physician, no drug, in the
isolated little town.And He--

But only sinners are taught by priests and preachers to look to God
for help.How much more deplorable, then,
is their condition than that of the wicked!"I told God out on the shales this afternoon that I just knew padre
Rosendo wouldn't die!"The soft, sweet voice hovered on the silence
like celestial melody._If ye ask anything in my name_--in my character--_it shall be given
you_.Carmen asked in the character of the sinless Christ, for her
asking was an assertion of what she instinctively knew to be truth,
despite the evidence of the physical senses.Her petitions were
affirmations of Immanuel--God with us."Carmen," whispered the priest hoarsely, "go back to your bed, and
know, just _know_ that God is here!Know that He did not make padre
Rosendo sick, and that He will not let him die!Know it for him--and
for me!""Why, Padre, I know that now!"The child looked up into the priest's
face with her luminous eyes radiating unshaken trust--a trust that
seemed born of understanding.Yea, she knew that all good was there,
for God is omnipotent.They had but to stretch forth their hands to
touch the robe of His Christ.The healing principle which cleansed the
lepers and raised the dead was even with them there in that quiet
room.Jose had only to realize it, nothing doubting.Carmen had done
her work, and her mind now was stayed on Him.Infinite Intelligence
did not know Rosendo as Jose was trying to know him, sick and dying.God is Life--and there is no death!Jose sat alone, his open Bible before him and
his thought with his God.Oh, for even a slight conception of Him who is Life!Moses worked "as
seeing Him who is invisible."Carmen lived with her eyes on Him,
despite her dreary mundane encompassment.And Jose, as he sat there
throughout the watches of the night, facing the black terror, was
striving to pierce the mist which had gone up from the face of the
ground and was separating him from his God.Through the long, dark
hours, with the quiet of death upon the desolate chamber, he sat mute
before the veil that was "still untaken away."What was it that kept telling him that Rosendo lay dying before him?Do fleshly nerves and
frail bodily organs converse with men?Can the externalization of
thought report back to the thought itself?Nay, the report came to him
from the physical senses--naught else.He
was seeing but his own thoughts of mixed good and evil.And they were
false, because they testified against God.But not as the physical senses were trying to
make Jose know him, sick and dying.Surely the subjective determines
the objective; for as we think, so are we--the Christ said that.From
his human standpoint Jose was seeing his thoughts of a dying mortal.And now he was trying to know that those thoughts did not come from
God--that they had no authority back of them--that they were children
of the "one lie" about God--that they were false, false as hell, and
therefore impotent and unreal.Nothing, for truth is beyond the reach of
personal sense.So God and His ideas, reflected by the real Rosendo,
were beyond the reach of evil.If this were true, then he must clear his own mentality--even as he
now knew Carmen had done out on the shales that afternoon.He was no
longer dealing with a material Rosendo, but with false beliefs about a
son of God.And to the serpent,
error, he was trying to say: "What is your authority?"If man is, then he always has been.And
he was never born--and never passes into oblivion.If two and two make four to-day, they always have done so,
and always will.Rosendo, when
moved by good, had gone into the wilds of Guamoco on a mission of
love.Did evil have power to smite him for his noble sacrifice?No, but a sense of
existence--and a false sense, for it postulates a god of evil opposed
to the one supreme Creator of all that really is.Then the testimony
that said Rosendo must die was cruelly false.And, more, it was
powerless--unless Jose himself gave it power.But she knew
God as Jose had never known Him.And, despite the testimony of the
fleshly eyes, she had turned from physical sense to Him.Jose had begun to see that discord was the result of unrighteousness,
false thought.He began to understand why it was that Jesus always
linked disease with sin.His own paradoxical career had furnished
ample proof of that.Yet his numberless tribulations were not due
solely to his own wrong thinking, but likewise to the wrong thought of
others with respect to him, thought which he knew not how to
neutralize.And the channels for this false, malicious, carnal thought
had been his beloved parents, his uncle, the Archbishop, his tutors,
and, in fact, all with whom he had been associated until he came to
Simiti.And there the false thought had met
a check, a reversal.And he was
slowly awaking to find nothing but good.The night hours flitted through the heavy gloom like spectral
acolytes.The steady roll of the frogs
in the lake at length died away.A flush stole timidly across the
eastern sky."Padre dear, he will not die."It was Carmen's voice that awoke the slumbering priest.The child
stood at his side, and her little hand clasped his.His chest rose and fell with the rhythmic breathing.A great lump came into his throat, and his voice trembled as
he spoke."You are right, _chiquita_.Go, call your madre Maria now, and I will
go home to rest."CHAPTER 13


That day Rosendo left his bed.Two days later he again set out for
Guamoco."There _is_ gold there, and I must, I _will_ find it!"he repeatedly
exclaimed as he pushed his preparations.On its rebound it carried him
over the protest of Dona Maria and the gloomy forebodings of his
fellow-townsmen, and launched him again on the desolate trail.He moved about wrapped in undefinable
awe.For he believed he had seen Rosendo lifted from the bed of death.And no one might tell him that it was not by the same power that long
ago had raised the dead man of Nain.Carmen had not spoken of the
incident again; and something laid a restraint upon Jose's lips.The eyes of the Alcalde bulged with astonishment when Rosendo entered
his store that morning in quest of further supplies."_Caramba!_ Go back to your bed, _compadre_!"he exclaimed, bounding
from his chair."You are walking in your delirium!""_Na, amigo_," replied Rosendo with a smile, "the fever has left me.And now I must have another month's supplies, for I go back to Guamoco
as soon as my legs tremble less.""_

The Alcalde acted as if he were in the presence of a ghost.But at
length becoming convinced that Rosendo was there on matters of
business, and in his right mind, he checked further expression of
wonder and, with a shrug of his fat shoulders, assumed his wonted air
of a man of large affairs."I can allow you five _pesos oro_ on account of the gold which the
_Cura_ brought me yesterday," he said severely."But that leaves you
still owing ten _pesos_ for your first supplies; and thirty if I give
you what you ask for now.If you cannot pay this amount when you
return, you will have to work it out for me."Rosendo well knew what the
threat implied."_Bien, compadre_," he quietly replied, "it will be as you say."Late that afternoon Juan returned from Bodega Central with a half
ounce of quinine.He had made the trip with astonishing celerity, and
had arrived at the riverine town just as a large steamer was docking.The purser supplied him with the drug, and he immediately started on
his return.The Alcalde set out to deliver the drug to Rosendo; but not finding
him at home, looked in at the parish house.Jose and Carmen were deep
in their studies."A thousand pardons, _Senor Padre_, but I have the medicine you
ordered for Rosendo," placing the small package upon the table."You may set it down against me, Don Mario," said Jose.exclaimed the Alcalde, "this must not be charged to the
parish!""I said to me, _amigo_," replied the priest firmly."It is the same thing, Padre!"The priest's anger began to rise, but he restrained it."Padre Diego
is no longer here, you must remember," he said quietly."But the parish pays your debts; and it would not pay the full value
of this and Juan's trip," was the coarse retort."Very well, then, Don Mario," answered Jose."You may charge it to
Rosendo.But tell me first how much you will place against him for
it.""The quinine will be five _pesos oro_,
and Juan's trip three additional.he demanded,
blustering before Jose's steady gaze."If Rosendo had been really sick
it would have saved his life!""Then you do not believe he was dangerously ill?""He couldn't have been really sick and be around to-day--could he?""No," he said slowly, "not _really_ sick."Then he quickly added:

"If you charge Rosendo eight _pesos_ for that bit of quinine, Don
Mario, you and I are no longer working together, for I do not take
base advantage of any man's necessities.""_Na, Senor
Padre_," he said hastily, with a sheepish grin."I will leave the
quinine with you, and do you settle the account with Juan."With which
he beat a disordered retreat.Jose was thankful that, for a few months, at least, he would have a
powerful hold on this man through his rapacity.What would happen
when the Alcalde at length learned that Rosendo was not searching for
Don Ignacio's lost mine, he did not care to conjecture.That matter
was in other hands than his, and he was glad to leave it there.He
asked now only to see each single step as he progressed."Did Don Mario say that stuff would cure padre Rosendo?"asked Carmen,
pointing to the quinine."Why did he say so, Padre?""Because he really believed it, _carita_.""But what is it, Padre--and how can it cure sick people?""It is the bark of a certain tree, little one, that people take as
medicine.It is a sort of poison which people take to counteract
another poison.A great school of medicine is founded upon that
principle, Carmen," he added.And then he fell to wondering if it
really was a principle, after all.But would the world believe that both he and Rosendo had been cured
by--what?By the operation of a great, almost
unknown principle?He saw himself and Rosendo restored, and
that was enough."They think the quinine cures
fever, little one," he resumed.The little face wore an anxious look as she put the
question."They think it does, _chiquita_," replied the priest, wondering what
he should say."But it is just because they think so that they get well, isn't it?""And if they thought right they would be cured without this--is it not
so, Padre dear?""I am sure of it--now," replied the priest."In fact, if they always
kept their thoughts right I am sure they would never be sick.""You mean, if they always thought about God," the child amended.If they knew, _really knew_, that God is
everywhere, that He is good, and that He never makes people sick, they
would always be well."It is only their bad thoughts that make them sick.And even then they are not really sick," the child concluded."They
think they are, and they think they die--and then they wake up and
find it isn't so at all."Had the child made this remark to him a few weeks before, he had
crushed it with the dull, lifeless, conventional formulae of human
belief.To-day in penitent humility he was trying to walk hand in hand
with her the path she trod.For he was learning from her that
righteousness is salvation.A few weeks ago he had lain at death's
door, yearning to pass the portal.Yesterday he believed he had again
seen the dark angel, hovering over the stricken Rosendo.But in each
case _something_ had intervened.Perhaps that "something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness," the unknown, almost unacknowledged
force that ceases not to combat evil in the human consciousness.Clinging to his petty egoisms; hugging close his shabby convictions of
an evil power opposed to God; stuffed with worldly learning and pride
of race and intellect, in due season, as he sank under the burden of
his imaginings, the veil had been drawn aside for a fleeting
moment--and his soul had frozen with awe at what it beheld!For, back of the density of the human concept, the fleeting,
inexplicable medley of good and evil which constitutes the phenomenon
of mortal existence, _he had seen God_!He had seen Him as all-inclusive
mind, omnipotent, immanent, perfect, eternal.He had caught a moment's
glimpse of the tremendous Presence which holds all wisdom, all
knowledge, yet knows no evil.He had seen a blinding flash of that
"something" toward which his life had strained and yearned.With it had
come a dim perception of the falsity of the testimony of physical
sense, and the human life that is reared upon it.And though he
counted not himself to have apprehended as yet, he was struggling,
even with thanksgiving, up out of his bondage, toward the gleam.The
shafts of error hissed about him, and black doubt and chill despair
still felled him with their awful blows.With
his hand in hers, he knew he was journeying toward God.On the afternoon before his departure Rosendo entered the parish house
in apprehension."I have lost my _escapulario_, Padre!""The string caught in the brush, and the whole thing was torn from my
neck.I--I don't like to go back without one," he added dubiously."Ah, then you have nothing left but Christ," replied Jose with fine
irony."But, Padre, it had been blessed by the Bishop!"Why, the Holy Father himself once blessed this
republic of ours, and now it is about the most unfortunate country in
the whole world!But you are a good Catholic, Rosendo, so you need not
fear."Rosendo was, indeed, a good Catholic.He accepted the faith of his
fathers without reserve.Simple,
superstitious, and great of heart, he held with rigid credulity to
all that had been taught him in the name of religion.But until Jose's
advent he had feared and hated priests.Nevertheless, his faith in
signs and miracles and the healing power of blessed images was
child-like.Once when he saw in the store of Don Mario a 
chromo of Venus and Cupid, a cheap print that had come with goods
imported from abroad, he had devoutly crossed himself, believing it to
be the Virgin Mary with the Christ-child."But I will fix you up, Rosendo," said Jose, noting the man's genuine
anxiety."Have Dona Maria cut out a cloth heart and fasten it to a
stout cord.I will take it to the church altar and bless it before the
image of the Virgin.You told me once that the Virgin was the Rincon
family's patron, you know.""_Bueno!_" ejaculated the pleased Rosendo, as he hastened off to
execute the commission.Several times before Rosendo went back to Guamoco Jose had sought to
draw him into conversation about his illness, and to get his view of
the probable cause of his rapid recovery.But the old man seemed loath
to dwell on the topic, and Jose could get little from him.At any
mention of the episode a troubled look would come over his face, and
he would fall silent, or would find an excuse to leave the presence of
the priest."Rosendo," Jose abruptly remarked to him as he was busy with his pack
late the night before his departure, "will you take with you the
quinine that Juan brought?""But what has she to do with it, _amigo_?""I--_Bien_, Padre, I promised her I would
not."Then:

"But if you fell sick up in Guamoco, Rosendo, what could you do?""_Quien sabe_, Padre!Perhaps I could gather herbs and make a tea--I
don't know.Then, in an anxious tone:

"Padre, what can I do?The little Carmen asks me not to take the
quinine, and I can not refuse her.I--I have
always taken medicine when I needed it and could get it.But the only
medicine we have in Simiti is the stuff that some of the women
make--teas and drinks brewed from roots and bark.I have never seen a
doctor here, nor any real medicines but quinine.And even that is hard
to get, as you know.I used to make a salve out of the livers of
_mapina_ snakes--it was for the rheumatism--I suffered terribly when I
worked in the cold waters in Guamoco.But
if I should get the disease now, would Carmen let me make the salve
again?""She says if I trust God I
will not get sick," he at length resumed."She says I must not think
about it._Caramba!_ What has that to do with it?People get sick
whether they think about it or not.Do you believe, Padre, this new
_escapulario_ will protect me?"The man's words reflected the strange mixture of mature and childish
thought typical of these untutored jungle folk, in which longing for
the good is so heavily overshadowed by an educated belief in the power
of evil."Rosendo," said Jose, finding at last his opportunity, "tell me, do
you think you were seriously ill day before yesterday?""_Quien sabe_, Padre!Perhaps it was only the _terciana_, after all.""Well, then," pursuing another tack, "do you think I was very sick
that day when I rushed to the lake--?"But you were turning cold--you hardly breathed--we
all thought you must die--all but Carmen!"the priest asked in a low, steady
voice."Why--Padre, I can not say.""Nor can I, positively, my friend.But I do know that the little
Carmen said I should not die.And she said the same of you when, as I
would swear, you were in the fell clutches of the death angel
himself.""Padre--" Rosendo's eyes were large, and his voice trembled in awesome
whisper--"is she--the little Carmen--is she--an _hada_?"cried Jose, bursting into a laugh at the
perturbed features of the older man."No, _amigo_, she is not an
_hada_!Let us say, rather, as you first expressed it to me, she is an
angel--and let us appreciate her as such."But," he continued, "I tell you in all seriousness, there are things
that such as you and I, with our limited outlook, have never dreamed
of; and that child seems to have penetrated the veil that hides
spiritual things from the material vision of men like us.Let us wait,
and if we value that '_something_' which she seems to possess and know
how to use, let us cut off our right hands before we yield to the
temptation to place any obstacle in the way of her development along
the lines which she has chosen, or which some unseen Power has chosen
for her.It is for you and me, Rosendo, to stand aside and watch,
while we protect her, if haply we may be privileged some day to learn
her secret in full.You and I are the unlearned, while she is filled
with wisdom.The world would say otherwise, and would condemn us as
fools.Thank God we are out of the world here in Simiti!"He choked back the inrush of memories and brushed away a tear."Rosendo," he concluded, "be advised.If Carmen told you not to think
of sickness while in Guamoco, then follow her instructions.It is not
the child, but a mighty Power that is speaking through her.Of that I
have long been thoroughly convinced.And I am as thoroughly convinced
that that same Power has appointed you and me her protectors and her
followers.You and I have a mighty compact--"

"_Hombre!_" interrupted Rosendo, clasping the priest's hand, "my life
is hers--you know it--she has only to speak, and I obey!"Assuredly, Rosendo," returned Jose.Let us
keep solely to ourselves what we have learned of her.I know not
whither we are being led.But we are in the hands of that'something'
that speaks and works through her--and we are satisfied.The next morning Rosendo set his face once
more toward the emerald hills of Guamoco.As the days passed, Jose became more silent and thoughtful.But it was
a silence bred of wonder and reverence, as he dwelt upon the things
that had been revealed to him.Who and what was this unusual child, so
human, and yet so strangely removed from the world's plane of thought?A child who understood the language of the birds, and heard the grass
grow--a child whom Torquemada would have burnt as a witch, and yet
with whom he could not doubt the Christ dwelt.Jose often studied her features while she bent over her work.He spent
hours, too, poring over the little locket which had been found among
her mother's few effects.The portrait of the man was dim and soiled.Jose wondered if the poor woman's kisses and tears had blurred it.The
people of Badillo said she had died with it pressed to her lips.But
its condition rendered futile all speculation in regard to its
original.That of the mother, however, was still fresh and clear.Jose
conjectured that she must have been either wholly Spanish, or one of
the more refined and cultured women of Colombia.And she had
doubtless been very young and beautiful when the portrait was made.With what dark tragedy was that little locket associated?But Carmen's brown curls and light skin--whence came they?And her keen mind, and deep
religious instinct?He could only be sure that they had come
from a source far, far above her present lowly environment.With that
much he must for the present be content.*       *       *       *       *

Another month unfolded its length in quiet days, and Rosendo again
returned.Not ill this time, nor even much exhausted.Nor did the
little leathern pouch contain more than a few _pesos_ in gold dust.But determination was written grim and trenchant upon his black face
as he strode into the parish house and extended his great hand to the
priest."I have only come for more supplies, Padre," he said."I have some
three _pesos_ worth of gold.Most of this I got around Culata, near
Don Felipe's quartz vein, the Andandodias._Caramba_, what veins in
those hills!If we had money to build a mill, and knew how to catch
the gold, we would not need to wash the river sands that have been
gone over again and again for hundreds of years!"But Jose's thoughts were of the Alcalde.He determined to send for him
at once, while Rosendo was removing the soil of travel.Don Mario came and estimated the weight of the gold by his hand.Then
he coolly remarked: "_Bien, Senor Padre_, I will send Rosendo to my
_hacienda_ to-morrow to cut cane and make _panela_.""He owes me thirty _pesos oro_, less
this, if you wish me to keep it.I see no likelihood that he can ever
repay me.And so he must now work out his debt.""How long will that take him, _amigo_?""_Quien sabe?_ _Senor Padre_," the Alcalde replied, his eyes
narrowing.The priest braced himself, and his face assumed an expression that it
had not worn before he came to Simiti."Look you now, my friend," he
began in tones pregnant with meaning."I have made some inquiries
regarding your system of peonage.I find that you pay your _peones_
from twenty to thirty cents a day for their hard labor, and at the
same time charge them as much a day for food.Or you force them to buy
from you tobacco and rum at prices which keep them always in your
debt."_Na_, Padre, you have been misinformed," the Alcalde demurred, with a
deprecating gesture.Lazaro Ortiz is now working for you on that system.And
daily he becomes more deeply indebted to you, is it not so?""But, Padre--"

"It is useless for you to deny it, Don Mario, for I have facts.Let us understand each other clearly, nor attempt to
dissimulate.That iniquitous system of peonage has got to cease in my
parish!""_Caramba_, but Padre Diego had _peones_!""And he was a wicked man," added Jose.Then he continued:

"I know not what information you may have from the Bishop regarding
me, yet this I tell you: I shall report you to Bogota, and I will band
the citizens of Simiti together to drive you out of town, if you do
not at once release Lazaro, and put an end to this wicked practice.It was a bold stroke, and the priest knew that he was standing upon
shaky ground.But the man before him was superstitious, untutored and
child-like.A show of courage, backed by an assertion of authority,
might produce the desired effect.Moreover, Jose knew that he was in
the right.Don Mario glared at him, while an ugly look spread over his coarse
features.The priest went on:

"Lazaro has long since worked out his debt, and you shall release him
at once.As to Rosendo, he must have the supplies he needs to return
to Guamoco."_Caramba!_" Don Mario's face was purple with rage."You think you can
tell me what to do--me, the Alcalde!""You think you can
make us change our customs!_Caramba!_ You are no better than the
priest Diego, whom you try to make me believe so wicked!_Hombre_, you
were driven out of Cartagena yourself!A nice sort to be teaching a
little girl--!"thundered Jose, striding toward him with upraised arm.Don Mario fell back in his chair and quailed before the mountainous
wrath of the priest.For a moment the girl stood looking in wonder at the angry men.Then
she went quickly to the priest and slipped a hand into his.A feeling
of shame swept over him, and he went back to his chair.Carmen leaned
against him, but she appeared to be confused."Cucumbra doesn't fight any more, Padre," the girl at length began in
hesitation."He and the puppy play together all the time now.He has
learned a lot, and now he loves the puppy.""_Bien_," he
said in soft tones, "I think we became a bit too earnest, Don Mario.We are good friends, is it not so?And we are working together for the
good of Simiti.But to have good come to us, we must do good to
others."He went to his trunk and took out a wallet."Here are twenty _pesos_,
Don Mario."It was all he had in the world, but he did not tell the
Alcalde so.Let him have the new
supplies he needs, and I will be his surety.And, friend, you are
going to let me prove to you with time that the report you have from
Cartagena regarding me is false."Don Mario's features relaxed somewhat when his hand closed over the
grimy bills."Do not forget, _amigo_," added Jose, assuming an air of mystery as he
pursued the advantage, "that you and I are associated in various
business matters, is it not so?"The Alcalde's mouth twitched, but finally extended in an unctuous
grin.After all, the priest was a descendant of the famous Don
Ignacio, and--who knew?--he might have resources of which the Alcalde
little dreamed."_Cierto, Padre!_" he cried, rising to depart."And we will yet
uncover La Libertad!_Bien_, he shall
have the supplies.But I think he should take another man with him.It was a gracious and unlooked for condescension."Send Lazaro to me, Don Mario," said Jose."We will find use for him,
I think."And thus Rosendo was enabled to depart a third time to the solitudes
of Guamoco.CHAPTER 14


With Rosendo again on the trail, Jose and Carmen bent once more to
their work.Within a few days the grateful Lazaro was sent to
Rosendo's _hacienda_, biding the time when the priest should have a
larger commission to bestow upon him.With the advent of the dry
season, peace settled over the sequestered town, while its artless
folk drowsed away the long, hot days and danced at night in the
silvery moonlight to the twang of the guitar and the drone of the
amorous canzonet.Jose was deeply grateful for these days of unbroken
quiet, and for the opportunity they afforded him to probe the child's
thought and develop his own.Night after
night he visited the members of his little parish, getting better
acquainted with them, administering to their simple needs, talking to
them in the church edifice on the marvels of the outside world, and
then returning to his little cottage to prepare by the feeble rays of
his flickering candle Carmen's lessons for the following day.He had
no texts, save the battered little arithmetic; and even that was
abandoned as soon as Carmen had mastered the decimal system.Thereafter he wrote out each lesson for her, carefully wording it that
it might contain nothing to shock her acute sense of the allness of
God, and omitting from the vocabulary every reference to evil, to
failure, disaster, sin and death.In mathematics he was sure of his
ground, for there he dealt wholly with the metaphysical.But history
caused him many an hour of perplexity in his efforts to purge it of
the dross of human thought.If Carmen were some day to go out into the
world she _must_ know the story of its past.And yet, as Jose faced
her in the classroom and looked down into her unfathomable eyes, in
whose liquid depths there seemed to dwell a soul of unexampled purity,
he could not bring himself even to mention the sordid events in the
development of the human race which manifested the darker elements of
the carnal mind.Perhaps, after all, she might never go out into the
world.He had not the faintest idea how such a thing could be
accomplished.And so under his tutelage the child grew to know a world
of naught but brightness and beauty, where love and happiness dwelt
ever with men, and wicked thoughts were seen as powerless and
transient, harmless to the one who knew God to be "everywhere."The
man taught the child with the sad remembrance of his own seminary
training always before him, and with a desire, amounting almost to
frenzy, to keep from her every limiting influence and benumbing belief
of the carnal mind.The decimal system mastered, Carmen was inducted into the elements of
algebra."How funny," she exclaimed, laughing, "to use letters for numbers!""They are only general symbols, little one," he explained."Symbols
are signs, or things that stand for other things."Then came suddenly into his mind how the great Apostle Paul taught
that the things we see, or think we see, are themselves but symbols,
reflections as from a mirror, and how we must make them out as best
we can for the present, knowing that, in due season, we shall see the
realities for which these things stand to the human mind.He knew that
back of the mathematical symbols stood the eternal, unvarying,
indestructible principles which govern their use.And he had begun to
see that back of the symbols, the phenomena, of human existence stands
the great principle--infinite God--the eternal mind.In the realm of
mathematics the principles are omnipotent for the solution of
problems--omnipotent in the hands of the one who understands and uses
them aright.And is not God the omnipotent principle to the one who
understands and uses Him aright in the solving of life's intricate
problems?"They are so easy when you know how, Padre dear," said Carmen,
referring to her tasks."But there will be harder ones, _chiquita_."But then I shall know more about the rules that you call
principles.""You do not know what the answer will be, _chiquita_," he ventured.If I use the rule in the right way
I shall get the correct answer, shall I not?she cried
joyfully, as she held up her paper with the completed solution of a
problem."But how do you know that it is correct?""Why--well, we can prove it--can't we?"Then she bent again over her task and worked
assiduously for some moments in silence.I worked it back again to the starting point."And in proving it, little one, you have proved the principle and
established its correctness.Is it not so, _chiquita_?""Yes, Padre, it shows that the rule is right."The child lapsed into silence, while Jose, as was becoming his wont,
awaited the result of her meditation.Then:

"Padre dear, there are rules for arithmetic, and algebra, and--and for
everything, are there not?""Yes, child, for music, for art, for everything.We can do nothing
correctly without using principles.""And, Padre, there are principles that tell us how to live?""What is your opinion on that point, _queridita_?""Just _one_ principle, I guess, Padre dear," she finally ventured,
after a pause.The Apostle John had dwelt
with the Master.What had he urged so often upon the dull ears of his
timid followers?The child looked up at the priest with a smile whose tenderness
dissolved the rising clouds of doubt."And God is--love," he finished softly.The child clapped her little hands and laughed
aloud.Jesus had said, "I and my Father are one."Having seen him, the
world has seen the Father.But Jesus was the highest manifestation of
love that tired humanity has ever known.he had cried in
tones that have echoed through the centuries.Apply the Principle of principles,
Love, to every task, every problem, every situation, every condition!For what is the Christ-principle but Love?All things are possible to
him who loves, for Love casteth out fear, the root of every discord.Men ask why God remains hidden from them, why their understanding of
Him is dim.They forget that to know Him
they must first love their fellow-men.And so the world goes
sorrowfully on, hating, cheating, grasping, abusing; still wondering
dully why men droop and stumble, why they consume with disease, and,
with the despairing conviction that God is unknowable, sinking at last
into oblivion.Jose, if he knew aught, knew that Carmen greatly loved--loved all
things deeply and tenderly as reflections of her immanent God.She had
loved the hideous monster that had crept toward her as she sat
unguarded on the lake's rim.Not so, for the arms of Love
were there about her.She had loved God--good--with unshaken fealty
when Rosendo lay stricken.She had known that Love could not manifest
in death when he himself had been dragged from the lake that burning
afternoon a few weeks before."God is the rule, isn't He, Padre dear?"The child's unexampled eyes
glowed like burning coals."And we can prove Him, too," she continued
confidently._Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open
you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there
shall not be room enough to receive it._

Prove Him, O man, that He is Love, and that Love, casting out hate and
fear, solves life's every problem!But first--_Bring ye all the tithes
into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house._ Bring your
whole confidence, your trust, your knowledge of the allness of good,
and the nothingness of evil.Bring, too, your every earthly hope,
every mad ambition, every corroding fear, and carnal belief; lay them
down at the doorway of mine storehouse, and behold their nothingness!As Carmen approached her simple algebraic problems Jose saw the
working of a rule infinite in its adaptation.She knew not what the
answers should be, yet she took up each problem with supreme
confidence, knowing that she possessed and rightly understood the rule
for correctly solving it.She knew that speculation regarding the
probable results was an idle waste of time.And she likewise knew
instinctively that fear of inability to solve them would paralyze her
efforts and insure defeat at the outset.Nor could she force solutions to correspond to what she might think
they ought to be--as mankind attempt to force the solving of their
life problems to correspond to human views.She was glad to work out
her problems in the only way they could be solved.Love, humility,
obedience, enabled her to understand and correctly apply the principle
to her tasks.The results were invariable--harmony and exceeding joy.Again that little hand had softly
swept his harp of life.And again he breathed in unison with its
vibrating chords a deep "Thank God!"Carmen looked up from a brown study."It stands for nothing, child," the priest made reply, wondering what
was to follow this introduction."And the minus sign in algebra is different from the one in
arithmetic."But, Padre, if God is all, how can you say there is nothing, or less
than nothing?""They are only human ways of
thinking, _chiquita_.The plus sign always represents something
positive; the minus, something negative.The one is the opposite of
the other.""Is there an opposite to everything, Padre?"Then:

"No, _chiquita_--not a _real_ opposite.But," he added hastily, "we
may suppose an opposite to everything.""That is what makes people sick and unhappy,
isn't it, Padre?"Supposing that there can be nothing,
when He is everywhere.Doesn't all trouble come from just supposing
things that are not so?"Whence came such questions to the mind of this child?And why did they
invariably lead to astonishing deductions in his own?Why did he
often give a great start as it dawned again upon him that he was not
talking to one of mature age, but to a babe?He tore a strip from the paper in his hand.Relatively the paper had
lost in size and quantity, and there was a distinct separation.The plus was always
positive and real; the minus was always relative, and stood for
unreality.And so it was throughout the entire realm of thought._Every real thing has its suppositional opposite._ The difficulty is
that the human mind, through long ages of usage, has come to regard
the opposite as just as real as the thing itself.The opposite of love
is hate; of health, disease; of good, evil; of the real, the
counterfeit.His opposite, the negative, is
supposition.Oh, stupid, blundering, dull-eared humanity, not to have
realized that this was just what Jesus said when he defined evil as
the lie about God!No wonder the prophet proclaimed salvation to be
righteousness, right thinking!But would gross humanity have
understood the Master better if he had defined it this way?No, they
would have stoned him on the spot!Jose knew that when both he and Rosendo lay sick unto death Carmen's
thought had been positive, while theirs had been of the opposite sign.And with the prophets before him, whom the
world laughed to scorn?What,
then, is the overcoming of evil but the driving out of entrenched
human beliefs?Again Jose came back to the thought of Principle.Confucius had said
that heaven was principle.Mankind are accustomed to speak lightly and knowingly of
their "principles."But in their search for the Philosopher's Stone
they have overlooked the Principle which the Master used to effect his
mighty works--"that Mind which was in Christ Jesus."The word evil is a comprehensive term, including errors of every sort.And yet, in the world's huge category of evils is there a single one
that stands upon a definite principle?Jose had to admit to himself
that there was not.Errors in mathematics result from ignorance of
principles, or from their misapplication.But are the errors real and
permanent?"Padre, when I make a mistake, and then go back and do the problem
over and get it right, what becomes of the mistake?""But, Padre," she pursued, "there are rules for solving problems; but
there isn't any rule or principle for making mistakes, is there?""And if I always knew the truth about things, I couldn't make
mistakes, could I?""Well, then, God doesn't know anything about mistakes--does He?""Then, Padre dear, nobody can know anything about mistakes.People
just think they can--don't they?""_Chiquita_, can you know that
two and two are seven?""Why, Padre dear, how funny!""Yes--it does seem strange--now.And yet, I used to think I could know
things just as absurd.""Why, what was that, Padre?""I thought, _chiquita_, that I could know evil--something that God
does not and can not know."It is absolutely impossible to know--to really _know_--error
of any sort.""If we knew it, Padre, it would have a rule; or as you say, a
principle, no?""And, since God is everywhere, He would have to be its principle."Now take another of the problems, _chiquita_, and
work on it while I think about these things," he said, assigning
another of the simple tasks to the child.For an idea was running through the man's thought, and he had traced
it back to the explorer in Cartagena.Reason and logic supported the
thought of God as mind; of the creation as the unfolding of this
mind's ideas; and of man as the greatest idea of God.It also seemed
to show that the physical senses afforded no testimony at all, and
that human beings saw, heard and felt only in thought, in belief.On
this basis everything reduced to a mental plane, and man became a
mentality.But what sort of mentality was that which Jose saw all
about him in sinful, sick and dying humanity?The human man is
demonstrably mortal--and he is a sort of mind--ah, yes, that was it!The explorer had said that up in that great country north there were
those who referred to this sort of mentality as "mortal mind."For, if the mortal man is a mind at all,
he assuredly is a _mortal_ mind.And the mortal mind is the opposite of that mind which is the eternal
God.Any so-called opposite to Him
must be a supposition--or, as Jesus defined it, the lie about Him.This lie seems to counterfeit the eternal mind that is God.It seems
to pose as a creative principle, and to simulate the powers and
attributes of God himself.It assumes to create its universe of
matter, the direct opposite of the spiritual universe.And, likewise,
it assumes to create its man, its own idea of itself, and hence the
direct opposite of the real man, the divine idea of God, made in His
own image and likeness."Surely," he murmured low, "the
material personality, called man, which sins, suffers and dies, is not
real man, but his counterfeit, a creation of God's opposite, the
so-called mortal mind.It must be a part of the lie about God, the
'mist' that went up from the ground and watered the whole face of the
earth, leaving the veil of supposition which obscures God from human
sight.It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that I have
always seen about me, and that the world refers to as human beings, or
mortals, and the physical universe.And yet I have been looking only
at my false thoughts of man."At that moment he caught sight of Juan running toward him from the
lake.The lad had just returned from Bodega Central."Padre," he exclaimed breathlessly, "there is war in the country
again!The revolution has broken out, and they are fighting all along
the river!"Jose turned into the house and clasped Carmen in his arms.CHAPTER 15


Juan's startling announcement linked Jose again with a fading past.Standing with his arm about Carmen, while the child looked up
wonderingly at her grimly silent protector, the priest seemed to have
fallen with dizzy precipitation from some spiritual height into a
familiar material world of men and events.Into his chastened
mentality there now rushed a rabble rout of suggestions, throwing into
wild confusion the orderly forces of mind which he was striving to
marshal to meet the situation.He recalled, for the first time in his
new environment, the significant conversation of Don Jorge and the
priest Diego, in Banco.He saw again the dark clouds that were
lowering above the unhappy country when he left Cartagena.And would carnal lust and rapine again drench fair
Colombia with the blood of her misguided sons?Were the disturbance
only a local uprising, headed by a coterie of selfish politicians, it
would produce but a passing ripple.Colombia had witnessed many such,
and had, by a judicious redistribution of public offices, generally
met the crises with little difficulty.On the other hand, if the
disorder drew its stimulus from the deep-seated, swelling sentiment of
protest against the continued affiliation of Church and State, then
what might not ensue before reason would again lay her restraining
hand upon the rent nation!For--strange anomaly--no strife is so
venomous, no wars so bloody, no issues so steeped in deadliest hatred,
as those which break forth in the name of the humble Christ.A buzzing concourse was gathering in the _plaza_ before the church.Leaving Carmen in charge of Dona Maria, Jose mingled with the excited
people.Juan had brought no definite information, other than that
already imparted to Jose, but his elastic Latin imagination had
supplied all lacking essentials, and now, with much gesticulation and
rolling of eyes, with frequent alternations of shrill chatter and
dignified pomp of phrase, he was portraying in a _melange_ of
picturesque and poetic Spanish the supposed happenings along the great
river.Jose forced the lad gently aside and addressed the thoroughly excited
people himself, assuring them that no reliable news was as yet at
hand, and bidding them assemble in the church after the evening meal,
where he would advise with them regarding their future course.He then
sought the Alcalde, and drew him into his store, first closing the
door against the excited multitude."_Bien, Senor Padre_, what are you going to do?"The Alcalde was
atremble with insuppressible excitement."Don Mario, we must protect Simiti," replied the priest, with a show
of calm which he did not possess."_Caramba_, but not a man will stay!The
_guerrillas_ will come, and Simiti will be burned to the ground!""_Na_, and be hacked by the _machetes_ of the _guerrillas_, or lassoed
by government soldiers and dragged off to the war?"The official
mopped the damp from his purple brow."_Caramba!_" he went on."But the Antioquanians will come down the
Simiti trail from Remedios and butcher every one they meet!They
hate us Simitanians, since we whipped them in the revolution of
seventy-six!if we stay here and beat them back,
then the federal troops will come with their ropes and chains and
force us away to fight on their side!_Nombre de Dios!_ I am for the
mountains--_pronto_!"And yet, in the welter of
conflicting thought two objects stood out above the rest--Carmen and
Rosendo.Would he fall afoul
of the bandits who find in these revolutions their opportunities for
plunder and bloodshed?As for Carmen--the priest's apprehensions were
piling mountain-high.He had quickly forgotten his recent theories
regarding the nature of God and man.He had been swept by the force of
ill tidings clean off the lofty spiritual plane up to which he had
struggled during the past weeks.Again he was befouled in the mire of
material fears and corroding speculations as to the probable
manifestations of evil, real and immanent.He
must take the child and fly at once.He would go to Dona Maria
immediately and bid her prepare for the journey."You had best go to Don Nicolas," replied Dona Maria, when the priest
had voiced his fears to her."He lives in Boque, and has a _hacienda_
somewhere up that river."Three hours from Simiti, across the shales.You must start with the
dawn, or the heat will overtake you before you arrive.""Then make yourself ready, Dona Maria," said Jose in relief, "and we
will set out in the morning.""Padre, I will stay here," the woman quietly replied."There will be many women too old to leave the town, Padre.I will
stay to help them if trouble comes.And I would not go without
Rosendo."Shame fell upon the priest like a blanket.He, the _Cura_, was
deserting his charge!And this quiet, dignified woman had shown
herself stronger than the man of God!He took the child by the hand and led her to his
own cottage."Carmen," he said, as she stood expectantly before him, "we--there is
trouble in the country--that is, men are fighting and killing down on
the river--and they may come here.We must--I mean, I think it best
for us to go away from Simiti for a while."The priest's eyes fell
before the perplexed gaze of the girl."The soldiers might come--wicked men might come and harm you,
_chiquita_!""Is it that you think they will,
Padre?""I fear so, little one," he made reply."Because they want to steal and kill," he returned sadly."They can't, Padre--they can't!""You told me
that people see only their thoughts, you know.They only think they
want to steal--and they don't think right--"

"But," he interrupted bitterly, "that doesn't keep them from coming
here just the same and--and--" He checked his words, as a faint memory
of his recent talks with the girl glowed momentarily in his seething
brain."But we can keep them from coming here, Padre--can't we?""By thinking right ourselves, Padre--you said so, days ago--don't you
remember?"The girl came to the frightened man and put her little arm
about his neck.It was an action that had become habitual with her."Padre dear, you read me something from your Bible just yesterday.It
was about God, and He said, 'I am that which was, and is, and is to
come.'But, Padre dear, if He is that which is to
come, how can anything bad come?"Could ye not watch one hour with me--the
Christ-principle?Must ye ever flee when the ghost of evil stalks
before you with his gross assumptions?But he had said those things to her and evolved
those beautiful theories in a time of peace.Now his feeble faith was
flying in panic before the demon of unbelief, which had been aroused
by sudden fear.The villagers were gathering before his door like frightened sheep.They sought counsel, protection, from him, the unfaithful shepherd.Could he not, for their sakes, tear himself loose from bondage to his
own deeply rooted beliefs, and launch out into his true orbit about
God?Was life, happiness, all, at the disposal of physical sense?And could not his love for them cast out his
fear?If the test had come, would he meet it, calmly, even alone with
his God, if need be?--or would he basely flee?But Carmen--she
was only a child, immature, inexperienced in the ways of the world!Yet the great God himself had caused His prophets to see that "a
little child shall lead them."And surely Carmen was now leading in
fearlessness and calm trust, in the face of impending evil.Jose rose from his chair and threw back his shoulders."My children," he said gently, holding out his
arms over them.I shall not leave Simiti, but
remain here to help and protect all who will stay with me.If the
_guerrillas_ or soldiers come we will meet them here, where we shall
be protecting our loved ones and our homes.Come to the church
to-night, and there we will discuss plans.Go now, and remember
that your _Cura_ has said that there shall no harm befall you."The people dispersed; Carmen was called by Dona Maria; and Jose
dropped down upon his bed to strive again to clear his mind of the
foul brood which had swept so suddenly into it, and to prepare for the
evening meeting.Late that night, as he crossed the road from the church to his
little home, his pulse beat rapidly under the stimulus of real joy.He
had conquered his own and the fears of the Alcalde, and that
official had at length promised to stay and support him.The
people's fears of impressment into military service had been calmly
met and assuaged, though Jose had yielded to their wish to form a
company of militia; and had even agreed to drill them, as he had
seen the troops of Europe drilled and prepared for conflict.There
were neither guns nor ammunition in the town, but they could drill
with their _machetes_--for, he repeated to himself, this was but a
concession, an expedient, to keep the men occupied and their minds
stimulated by his own show of courage and preparedness.It was
decided to send Lazaro Ortiz at once into the Guamoco district, to
find and warn Rosendo; while Juan was to go to Bodega Central for
whatever news he might gather, and to return with immediate warning,
should danger threaten their town.Similar instruction was to be
sent to Escolastico, at Badillo.Within a few days a runner should be
despatched over the Guamoco trail, to spread the information as
judiciously as possible that the people of Simiti were armed and
on the alert to meet any incursion from _guerrilla_ bands.The priest would now strive
mightily to keep his own thought clear and his courage alive, to
sustain his people in whatever experience might befall them.Quiet reigned in the little village the next morning, and its people
went about their familiar duties with but a passing thought of the
events of the preceding day.The Alcalde called at the parish house
early for further instructions in regard to the proposed company of
militia.The priest decided to drill his men twice a day, at the
rising and setting of the sun.Carmen's lessons were then resumed, and
soon Jose was again laboring conscientiously to imbibe the spirit of
calm trust which dwelt in this young girl.The Master's keynote before every threatening evil was, "Be not
afraid."Carmen's life-motif was, "_God is everywhere._" Jose strove
to see that the Christ-principle was eternal, and as available to
mankind now as when the great Exemplar propounded it to the dull ears
of his followers.When they have
done this, Christianity will be as scientific and demonstrable to
mankind as is now the science of mathematics.A rule, though
understood, is utterly ineffective if not applied.Yet, how to apply
the Christ-principle?is the question convulsing a world to-day.God, the infinite creative mind, is that principle.Jesus showed
clearly--so clearly that the wonder is men could have missed the mark
so completely--that the great principle becomes available only when
men empty their minds of pride, selfishness, ignorance, and human
will, and put in their place love, humility and truth.This step
taken, there will flow into the human consciousness the qualities of
God himself, giving powers that mortals believe utterly impossible to
them.But hatred must go; self-love, too; carnal ambition must go; and
fear--the cornerstone of every towering structure of mortal
misery--must be utterly cast out by an understanding of the allness of
the Mind that framed the spiritual universe.Jose, looking at Carmen as she sat before him, tried to know that love
was the salvation, the righteousness, right-thinking, by which alone
the sons of men could be redeemed.The world would give such utterance
the lie, he knew.The sons of earth must
be warriors, and valiantly fight!the tired old world has fought
for ages untold, and gained--nothing.He loved his enemies with a love that
understood the allness of God, and the consequent nothingness of the
human concept.Knowing the concept of man as mortal to be an illusion,
Jesus then knew that he had no enemies.The work-day closed, and Carmen was about to leave.A shadow fell
across the open doorway.A man, dressed in clerical
garb, stood looking in, his eyes fixed upon Carmen.Jose's heart
stopped, and he sat as one stunned.the newcomer cried, advancing with
outstretched hands.I ached to think I might not
find you here!can this be my little Carmen, from
whom I tore myself in tears four years ago and more?_Diablo!_ but she
has grown to be a charming _senorita_ already."He bent over and
kissed the child loudly upon each cheek.Jose with difficulty restrained himself from pouncing upon the man as
he watched him pass his fat hands over the girl's bare arms and feast
his lecherous eyes upon her round figure and plump limbs.The child
shrank under the withering touch.Freeing herself, she ran from the
room, followed by a taunting laugh from Diego."_Caramba!_" he exclaimed, sinking into the chair vacated by the girl."But I had the devil's own trouble getting here!And I find everything
quiet as a funeral in this sink of a town, just as if hell were not
spewing fire down on the river!_Dios!_ But give me a bit of rum,
_amigo_.My spirits droop like the torn wing of a heron.""_Hombre!_ With what do you quench your thirst?"Then he added with a fatuous grin:

"No, I have not yet honored the Alcalde with a call.Anxious care
drove me straight from the boat to you; for with you, a brother
priest, I knew I would find hospitality and protection."After a few moments, during which he fanned
himself vigorously with his black felt hat, Diego continued volubly:

"You are consumed to know what brings me here, eh?_Bien_, I will
anticipate your questions.And--you know they do not love priests down that way--well, I saw that
it had come around to my move."But," he continued, "luckily I had screwed plenty of Masses out of
the Banco sheep this past year, and my treasure box was comfortably
full._Bueno_, I hired a canoe and a couple of strapping _peones_, who
brought me by night, and by damnably slow degrees, up the river to
Bodega Central.As luck would have it, I chanced to be there the day
Juan arrived from Simiti.So I straightway caused inquiry to be made
of him respecting the present whereabouts of our esteemed friend, Don
Rosendo.Learning that my worthy brother was prospecting for La
Libertad, it occurred to me that this decaying town might afford me
the asylum I needed until I could make the necessary preparations to
get up into the mountains._Caramba!_ but I shall not stay where a
stray bullet or a badly directed _machete_ may terminate my noble
life-aspirations!""But, how dared you come to Simiti?""You were once forced to leave this town--!""Assuredly, _amigo_," Diego replied with great coolness."And I would
not risk my tender skin again had I not believed that you were here to
shield me.Their most
accessible point is by way of Simiti.From here I can go to the San
Lucas country; eventually get back to the Guamoco trail; and
ultimately land in Remedios, or some other town farther south, where
the anticlerical sentiment is not so cursedly strong.I have money and
two <DW64> boys.The boat I shall have to leave here in your care._Bien_, learning that Rosendo, my principal annoyance and obstruction,
was absent, and that you, my friend, were here, I decided to brave the
wrath of the simple denizens of this hole, and spend a day or two as
guest of yourself and my good friend, the Alcalde, before journeying
farther.Thus you have it all, in _parvo_.But, _Dios y diablo_!that
trip up the river has nearly done for me!We traveled by night and hid
in the brush by day, where millions of gnats and mosquitoes literally
devoured me!_Caramba!_ and you so inhospitable as to have no rum!"Then he resumed:

"A voluptuous little wench, that Carmen!But
don't let our worthy Don Wenceslas hear of her good looks, for he'd
pop her into a convent _presto_!And later he--_Bien_, you had better
get rid of her before she makes you trouble.I'll take her off your
hands myself, even though I shall be traveling for the next few
months.But, say," changing the subject abruptly, "Don Wenceslas
sprung his trap too soon, eh?""I don't follow you," said Jose, consuming with indignation over the
priest's coarse talk."_Diablo!_ he pulls a revolution before it is ripe.It begins as he intended, anticlerical; and so it will run for
a while.But after that--_Bien_, you will see it reverse itself and
turn solely political, with the present Government on top at the last,
and the end a matter of less than six weeks."asked Jose, eagerly grasping at a new hope."_Hombre!_ But I have been too close to
matters religious and political in this country all my life not to
know that Don Wenceslas has this time committed the blunder of being
a bit too eager.Had he waited a few months longer, and then pulled
the string--_Dios y diablo_!there would have been such a fracas as to
turn the Cordilleras bottom up!Now all that is set back for
years--_Quien sabe_?""But," queried the puzzled Jose, "how could Wenceslas, a priest,
profit by an anticlerical war?""_Caramba, amigo!_ But the good Wenceslas is priest only in name!He
is a politician, bred to the game.He lays his plans with the
anticlericals, knowing full well that Church and State can not be
separated in this land of mutton-headed _peones_._Bueno_, the clever
man precipitates a revolution that can have but one result, the closer
union of Rome and the Colombian Government.And for this he receives
the direction of the See of Cartagena and the disposition of the rich
revenues from the mines and _fincas_ of his diocese."And, _amigo_, how long will this disturbance continue?""I have told you, a few weeks at the most," replied Diego with a show
of petulance."But, just the same, as agent of your friend Wenceslas,
I have been a mite too active along the river, especially in the town
of Banco, to find safety anywhere within the pale of civilization
until this little fracas blows over.This one being an abortion, the
next revolution can come only after several years of most painstaking
preparation.But, mark me, _amigo_, that one will not miscarry, nor
will it be less than a scourge of the Lord!"Despite the sordidness of the man, Jose was profoundly grateful to him
for this information.And there could be no doubt of its authenticity,
coming as it did from a tool of Wenceslas himself.Jose became
cheerful, even animated.Now when do you expect to set out for San Lucas?""_Diablo!_ Then I must be off at once!""_Caramba, hermano!_ Why so desirous of my departure?To be sure,
to-morrow, if possible.But I must have a chat with our good friend,
the Alcalde.So do me the inexpressible favor to accompany me to his
door, and there leave me.My _peones_ are down at the boat, and I
would rather not face the people of Simiti alone."At that moment Dona Maria appeared at the door
bearing a tray with Jose's supper.She stopped short as she recognized
Diego."Ah, _Senora Dona Maria_!"The woman looked inquiringly from Diego to Jose.Without a word she
set the tray on the table and quickly departed."H'm, _amigo_, I think it well to visit the Alcalde at once," murmured
Diego."I regret that I bring the amiable senora no greeting from her
charming daughter._Ay de mi!_" he sighed, picking up his hat."The
conventions of this world are so narrow!"Don Mario exclaimed loudly when he beheld the familiar figure of Padre
Diego.Recovering from his astonishment he broke into a loud guffaw
and clapped the grinning priest heartily upon the back.I can forgive all your
wickedness at sight of such nerve!calling to his daughter in
the _patio_."That last _garrafon_ and some glasses!stepping aside
and ceremoniously waving them in."Our friend finds that his supper awaits him," said Diego, laying a
hand patronizingly upon Jose's arm."But I will eat with you, my good
Don Mario, and occupy a _petate_ on your floor to-night._Conque_,
until later, Don Jose," waving a polite dismissal to the latter."If
not to-night, then in the morning _temprano_."The audacity of the man nettled Jose.He would have liked to be
present during the interview between the Alcalde and this cunning
religio-political agent, for he knew that the weak-kneed Don Mario
would be putty in his oily hands.However, Diego had shown him that he
was not wanted.And there was nothing to do but nurse his temper and
await events.But, whatever deplorable results the visit of Diego might entail, he
had at least brought present comfort to Jose in his report of the
militant uprising now in progress, and the latter would sleep this
night without the torment of dread apprehension.The next morning Diego entered the parish house just as master and
pupil were beginning their day's work.he exclaimed, "our parochial school is quite discriminating!_Bien_, are there not enough children in the town to
warrant a larger school, and with a Sister in charge?I will report
the matter to the good Bishop.""There is a school here, as you know,
_amigo_, with a competent master," he replied with what calmness he
could muster.It was perhaps a hasty and unfortunate remark, for Jose knew he had
been jealously selfish with Carmen."A private school, to which the
stubborn beasts that live in this sink will not send their brats!There must be a parochial school in Simiti, supported by the people!Oh, don't worry; there is gold enough here, buried in _patios_ and
under these innocent-looking mud walls, to support the Pope for a
decade--and that," he chuckled, "is no small sum!"His eyes roved over Carmen and he began a mental appraisement of the
girl."_Caramba!_" muttering half to himself, after he had feasted his
sight upon her for some moments, "but she is large for her age--and,
_Dios y diablo!_ a ravishing beauty!"Then an idea seemed to filter
through his cunning brain.His coarse, unmoral face brightened, and
his thick lips parted in an evil smile."Come here, little one," he said patronizingly, extending his arms to
the child."Come, give your good _Padre_ his morning kiss."The girl shrank back in her chair and looked appealingly at Jose.Then I must come and steal it; and when you confess to good Padre
Jose you may tell him it was all my fault."A look of horror came into the child's face and
she sprang from her seat.He seized Diego by the
shoulder and whirled him quickly about.His face was menacing and his
frame trembled.The voice was low, tense, and deliberate."If
you lay a hand on that child I will strike you dead at my feet!"_Cielo!_ was this the timid sheep that had stopped for
a moment in Banco on its way to the slaughter?But there was no
mistaking the spirit manifested now in that voice and attitude.he exclaimed, a foolish grin splitting his ugly
features.It would be well to understand each other more
thoroughly."Heaven knew, he could not afford
to make enemies, especially at this juncture!But he had not misread
the thought coursing through the foul mind of Diego.And yet, violence
now might ruin both the child and himself."I--I was perhaps a little hasty, _amigo_," he began in gentler tones."But, as you see, I have been quite wrought up of late--the news of
the revolution, and--in these past months there have been many things
to cause me worry.I--"

"Say no more, good friend," interrupted the oily Diego, his beady eyes
twinkling."But you will not wonder it struck me odd that a father
should not be permitted to embrace his own daughter."Dead silence, heavy and stifling, fell upon Jose.Slowly his throat
filled, and his ears began to throb.Diego sat before him, smiling and
twirling his fat thumbs.He looked like the images of Chinese gods
Jose had seen in foreign lands.Of course, the strain of
yesterday had been too much for him!His overwrought mind had read
into words and events meanings which they had not been meant to
convey."True, _amigo_," he managed to say, striving to steady his voice."But
we spiritual Fathers should not forget--"

Diego laughed egregiously.Let us get to the meat in
the nut.Why do you think I am in Simiti, braving the wrath of Rosendo
and others?Why have I left my comfortable quarters in Banco, to
undertake a journey, long and hazardous, to this godless hole?"He paused, apparently enjoying the suffering he saw depicted upon
Jose's countenance."But you will keep my confidence, no?We are brother priests, and must hold together.You protect me in
this, and I return the favor in a like indiscretion._Bien_, I
explain: I am here partly because of the revolution, as I told you
yesterday, and partly, as I did not tell you, to see my little girl,
my daughter, Carmen--

"_Caramba_, man!"he cried, bounding to his feet, as he saw Jose
slowly rise before him.Jose dropped back into his chair like a withered leaf in the lull of a
winter's wind."_Dios y diablo_, but it rends me to make this confession, _amigo_!And yet, I look to you for support!The girl, Carmen--_I am her
father!_"

Diego paced dramatically up and down before the scarce hearing Jose
and unfolded his story in a quick, jerky voice, with many a gesture
and much rolling of his bright eyes."Her mother was a Spanish woman of high degree.My
vows prevented me from marrying her, else I should have done so._Caramba_, but I loved her!_Bien_, I was called to Cartagena.She
feared, in her delicate state, that I was deserting her.She tried to
follow me, and at Badillo was put off the boat.There, poor child, she
passed away in grief, leaving her babe.May she rest forever on the
bosom of the blessed Virgin!"Diego bowed reverently and crossed
himself.Two years later I was assigned to the parish of Simiti.Here I saw the
little locket which I had given her, and knew that Carmen was my
child.Ah, _Dios!_ what a revelation to a breaking heart!But I could
not openly acknowledge her, for I was already in disgrace, as you
know.And, once down, it is easy to sink still further.I confess, I
was indiscreet here.Rosendo's daughter followed
me, despite my protests._Bien_, time passed,
and you came.I had hoped you would take the little Carmen under your
protection.God, how I grieved for the child!At last I determined,
come what might, to see her.The revolution drove me to the mountains;
and love for my girl brought me by way of Simiti.And now, _amigo_,
you have my confession--and you will not be hard on me?_Caramba_, I
need a friend!"He sat down, and mopped his wet brow.Jose was staring with unseeing eyes out
through the open doorway.A stream of sunlight poured over the dusty
threshold, and myriad motes danced in the golden flood."_Bien, amigo_," Diego resumed, with more confidence."I had not
thought to reveal this, my secret, to you--nor to any one, for that
matter--but just to get a peep at my little daughter, and assure my
anxious heart of her welfare.But since coming here and seeing how
mature she is my plans have taken more definite shape.I shall leave
at daybreak to-morrow, if Don Mario can have my supplies ready on this
short notice, and--will take Carmen with me."The color had left his face, and
ages seemed to bestride his bent shoulders.His voice quavered as he
slowly spoke.It were better that we should not meet again
until you depart.""But, _amigo_--ah, I feel for you, believe me!You are attached to the
child--who would not be?_Caramba_, what is this world but a cemetery
of bleaching hopes!_Amigo_, send the child to
me at the house of the Alcalde.I would hold her in my arms and feel a
father's joy.And bid the good Dona Maria make her ready for
to-morrow's journey.""You
said--the San Lucas district?""_Quien sabe?_ good friend," Diego made hasty reply."My plans seem
quite altered since coming here.And you will send Carmen to me at once?And bid her bring
her mother's locket._Conque, hasta luego, amigo._"

He went to the door, and seeing his two <DW64> _peones_ loitering near,
walked confidently and briskly to the house of Don Mario.Jose, bewildered and benumbed, staggered into his sleeping room and
sank upon the bed.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre--Padre dear."Carmen stood beside the stricken priest, and her little hand crept
into his."I watched until I saw him go, and then I came in.He has bad
thoughts, hasn't he?But--Padre dear, what is it?Did he make you
think bad thoughts, too?He can't, you know, if you don't want to."She bent over him and laid her cheek against his.Jose stared unseeing
up at the thatch roof."Padre dear, everything has a rule, a principle, you told me.But his thoughts haven't any principle, have they?Any
more than the mistakes I make in algebra.The child kissed the suffering man and wound her arms about his neck."Padre dear, he couldn't say anything that could make you unhappy--he
just couldn't!God is _everywhere_, and you are His child--and I am,
too--and--and there just isn't anything here but God, and we are in
Him.Why, Padre, we are in Him, just like the little fish in the lake!Isn't it nice to know that--to really _know_ it?"Aye, if he had really known it he would not now be stretched upon a
bed of torment.Was he not really yielding to the mesmerism of human events?Why, oh,
why could he not remain superior to them?Why continually rise and
fall, tossed through his brief years like a dry weed in the blast?It was because he _would_ know evil, and yield to its mesmerism.His
enemies were not without, but within.How could he hope to be free
until he had passed from self-consciousness to the sole consciousness
of infinite good?"Padre dear, his bad thoughts have only the minus sign, haven't
they?"Yes, and Jose's now carried the same symbol of nothingness.Carmen was
linked to the omnipresent mind that is God; and no power, be it Diego
or his superior, Wenceslas, could effect a separation.But if Carmen was Diego's child, she must go with him.Jose could no
longer endure this torturing thought.He rose from the bed and sought
Dona Maria."Senora," he pleaded, "tell me again what you know of Carmen's
parents."The good woman was surprised at the question, but could add nothing to
what Rosendo had already told him.study it as he might, the portrait of the man was wholly
indistinguishable.The sweet, sad face of the young mother looked out
from its frame like a suffering.In it he thought he saw a
resemblance to Carmen.As for Diego, the child certainly did not
resemble him in the least.But years of dissipation and evil doubtless
had wrought their changes in his features.He rose and searched
through the house for her.Dona Maria, busy in the kitchen, had not
seen her leave.His search futile, he returned with heavy heart to his
own house and sat down to think._When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee._ Not "if,"
but "when."The sharp experiences of human existence are not to be
avoided.But in their very midst the Christ-principle is available to
the faithful searcher and worker.Jose,
alarmed beyond measure, prepared to set out in search of her.But at
that moment one of Diego's _peones_ appeared at the door with his
master's request that the child be sent at once to him.At least,
then, she was not in his hands; and Jose breathed more freely.It
seemed to him that, should he see her in Diego's arms, he must
certainly strangle him.Only a few
minutes before he had threatened to kill him!Unspeakably wearied with his incessant
mental battle, he threw himself again upon his bed, and at length sank
into a deep sleep.The shadows were gathering when he awoke with a start.Leaping from the bed, he hastened to the door, just
as Rosendo, swaying beneath his pack, and accompanied by Lazaro Ortiz,
rounded the corner and made toward him._"Hola, amigo Cura!"_ Rosendo shouted, his face radiant."Come and bid
me welcome, and receive good news!"At the same moment Carmen came flying toward them from the direction
of the shales.Jose instantly divined the motive which had sent her
out there.He turned his face to hide the tears which sprang to his
eyes.Then he hastened to his
faithful ally and clasped him in his arms.CHAPTER 16


Struggling vainly with his agitation, while the good tidings which he
could no longer hold fairly bubbled from his lips, Rosendo dragged the
priest into the parish house and made fast the doors.Swinging his
chair to the floor, he hastily unstrapped his kit and extracted a
canvas bag, which he handed to Jose."Padre," he exclaimed in a loud whisper, "we have found it!"_Hombre!_ not less
than forty _pesos oro_--and more up there--quien sabe how much!_Caramba!_"

Rosendo fell into a chair, panting with excitement.Jose sat down with
quickening pulse and waited for the full story."Padre--I knew we would find it--but not this way!_Hombre!_ It was
back of Popales.I had been washing the sands there for two days after
my return.There was a town at that place, years ago.The stone
foundations of the houses can still be seen.The Tigui was rich at
that point then; but it is washed out now._Bien_, one morning I
started out at daybreak to prospect Popales creek, the little stream
cutting back into the hills behind the old settlement.There was a
heavy mist over the whole valley, and I could not see ten feet before
my face._Bien_, I had gone up-stream a long distance, perhaps several
miles, without finding more than a few colors, when suddenly the mist
began to clear, and there before me, only a few feet away, stood a
young deer, just as dumfounded as I was."He paused a moment for breath, laughing meanwhile at the memory of his
surprise."_Bueno_, fresh venison looked good to me, Padre, living on salt
_bagre_ and beans.But I had no weapon, save my _machete_.So I let
drive with that, and with all my strength.The big knife struck the
deer on a leg.The animal turned and started swiftly up the mountain
side, with myself in pursuit._Caramba_, that was a climb!But with
his belly chasing him, a hungry man will climb anything!Through palms
and ferns and high weeds, falling over rocks and tripping on ground
vines we went, clear to the top of the hill.Then the animal turned
and plunged down a glen.On the descent it traveled faster, and in a
few minutes had passed clean from my sight."The glen," he continued, "ran down for perhaps a hundred yards, and
then widened into a clearing.I have been in the Popales country many
times, Padre, but I had never been to the top of this mountain, nor
had I ever seen this glen, which seemed to be an ancient trail.So I
went on down toward the clearing.As I approached it I crossed what
apparently was the bed of an ancient stream, dry now, but with many
pools of water from the recent rains, which are very heavy in that
region._Bien_, I turned and followed this dry bed for a long
distance, and at last came out into the open.I found myself in a
circular space, surrounded by high hills, with no opening but the
stream bed along which I had come.At the far end of the basin-shaped
clearing the creek bed stopped abruptly; and I then knew that the
water had formerly come over the cliff above in a high waterfall, but
had flowed in a direction opposite to that of Popales creek, this
mountain being the divide."_Bueno_; now for my discovery!I several times filled my _batea_ with
gravel from the dry bed and washed it in one of the pools.But as I dug along the margin of the bed I
noticed what seemed to be pieces of adobe bricks.I went on up one
side of the bowl-shaped glen, and found many such pieces, and in some
places stones that had served as foundations for houses at one time.So I knew that there had been a town there, long, long ago.But it
must have been an Indian village, for had it been known to the
Spaniards I surely would have learned of it from my parents.The
ground higher up was strewn with the broken bricks.I picked up many
of the pieces and examined them.Almost every one showed a color or
two of gold; but not enough to pay washing the clay from which they
had been made.But--and here is the end of my story--I have said that
this open space was shaped like a bowl, with all sides dipping sharply
to the center.It occurred to me that in the years--who knows how
many?--that have passed since this town was abandoned, the heavy rains
that had dissolved the mud bricks also must have washed the mud and
the gold it carried down into the center of this basin, where, with
great quantities of water sweeping over it every rainy season, the
clay and sand would gradually wash out, leaving the gold concentrated
in the center."The old man stopped to light the thick cigar which he had rolled
during his recital."_Caramba!_ Padre, it was a lucky thought!I located the center of the
big bowl as nearly as possible, and began to dig.I washed some of the
dirt taken a foot or two below the surface.it left a string
of gold clear around the _batea_!I became so excited I could scarcely
dig.Every batea, as I got deeper and deeper, yielded more and more
gold!I hurried back to the Tigui for my supplies; and then camped up
there and washed the sand and clay for two weeks, until I had to come
back to Simiti for food.Forty _pesos oro_ in fifteen days!_Caramba!_
And there is more.And all concentrated from the mud bricks of that
old, forgotten town in the mountains, miles back of Popales!May the
Virgin bless that deer and mend its hurt leg!"One hundred and sixty francs in shining gold flakes!And who knew how
much more to be had for the digging!"Ah, Padre," mused Rosendo, "it is wonderful how things turn out--that
is, when, as the little Carmen says, you think right!I thought I'd
find it--I knew it was right!_Caramba!_"

At the mention of Carmen's name Jose again became troubled.Rosendo as
yet did not know of Diego's presence in Simiti.Rosendo would learn of it soon enough; and Jose
dared not cast a blight upon the happiness of this rare moment.As they sat reunited at the supper table in Rosendo's house, a
constant stream of townspeople passed and repassed the door, some
stopping to greet the returned prospector, others lingering to witness
Rosendo's conduct when he should learn of Diego's presence in the
town, although no one would tell him of it.The atmosphere was tense
with suppressed excitement, and Jose trembled with dread.Dona Maria
moved quietly about, giving no hint of the secret she carried.Carmen
laughed and chatted, but did not again mention the man from whose
presence she had fled to the shales that morning.Who could doubt that
in the midst of the prevalent mental confusion she had gone out there
"_to think_"?And having performed that duty, she had, as usual, left
her problem with her immanent God."I will go up and settle with Don Mario this very night," Rosendo
abruptly announced, as they rose from the table."Lazaro has told you of the
revolution; and we have many plans to consider, now that we have found
gold.We
can slip out through the rear door, and so avoid these curious people."My honest debts first, _buen Cura_," he said
sturdily.And throwing back his shoulders he strutted about the room
with the air of a plutocrat.With his bare feet, his soiled, flapping
attire, and his swelling sense of self-importance he cut a comical
figure."But, Rosendo--" Jose was at his wits' end.I want to make you captain of the militia we
are forming, and I must talk with you alone first!"The childish egotism of the old man was instantly touched.He slapped his chest and
strode proudly around the room.Capitan Don Rosendo Ariza,
S!_ Ha!Shall I carry a sword and wear gold braid?--But these fellows
are mighty curious," he muttered, looking out through the door at the
loitering townsfolk."The shales, then, Padre!Close the front door,
Carmencita."Jose scarcely breathed until, skirting the shore of the lake and
making a detour of the town, he and Rosendo at length reached the
shale beds unnoticed."Rosendo, the gold deposit that you have discovered--is it safe?And no one would think of looking
there for gold.I discovered it by the merest chance, and I left no
trace of my presence.Besides, there are no gold hunters in that
country, and very few people in the entire district of Guamoco.""And how long will it take you to wash out the deposit, do you
think?""_Quien sabe?_ Padre."But you cannot return to Guamoco until the revolution is over.""_Bien_, Padre, I will remain in Simiti a week or two.We may then
know what to expect of the revolution.""Rosendo, about the gold for Cartagena: how can we send it, even when
peace is restored?""Juan might go down each month," Rosendo suggested.The expense would be greater than the amount shipped.Besides, our work must be done with the utmost
secrecy.No one but ourselves must know of your discovery.And no one
else in Simiti must know where we are sending the gold.Rosendo, it is
a great problem."Then:

"Rosendo, the little Carmen makes great progress.""_Por supuesto!_ I knew she would."Have you no idea, Rosendo, who her parents might have been?""Has it ever occurred to you, Rosendo, that, because of her deeply
religious nature, possibly her father was a priest?""_Caramba, no!_" ejaculated Rosendo, turning upon Jose."What puts
that into your head, _amigo_?""As I have said, Rosendo," Jose answered, "her religious instinct.""_Bien, Senor Padre_, you forget that priests are not religious.""But some are, Rosendo," persisted Jose in a tone of protest.But those who are do not have children," was Rosendo's
simple manner of settling the argument.Its force appealed to Jose, and he felt a shade of relief.But, if
Diego were not the father of Carmen, what motive had he for wishing to
take her with him, other than to train her eventually to become his
concubine?"But, Padre, we came out here to talk about the militia of which I am
to be captain._Bien_, we must begin work to-morrow._Hombre_, but the
senora's eyes will stand out when she sees me marching at the head of
the company!""And now that we have gold, Padre, I must send to Cartagena for a gun."You probably could not obtain one, Rosendo.The Government is so
afraid of revolutions that it prohibits the importation of arms.But
even if you could, it would cost not less than fifty _pesos oro_."_Caramba!_" exclaimed the artless fellow.But now let us name those who will form the company."By dwelling on the pleasing theme, Jose managed to keep Rosendo
engaged until fatigue at length drove the old man to seek his bed.The
town was wrapped in darkness as they passed through its quiet streets,
and the ancient Spanish lantern, hanging crazily from its moldering
sconce on the corner of Don Felipe's house, threw the only light into
the black mantle that lay upon the main thoroughfare.*       *       *       *       *

At sunrise, Jose was awakened by Rosendo noisily entering his house.A glance at the old man showed that he was laboring under strong
emotion."What sort of friendship is this," he demanded curtly, "that you keep
me from learning of Diego's presence in Simiti?It was a trick you
served me--and friends do not so to one another!"He stood looking
darkly at the priest."There, comfort yourself, Padre," replied Rosendo, a sneer curling his
lips."Your friend is safe--for the present.He and his <DW64> rascals
fled before sunrise."_Bueno_, then across the lake,
toward the Juncal.Don Mario stocked their boat last night, while you
kept me out on the shales._Buen arreglo, no?_"

"Yes, Rosendo," replied Jose gladly, "an excellent arrangement to keep
you from dipping your hands in his foul blood.Have you no thought of Carmen and her future?"he has spread the report that he is her father!_Caramba!_ For that I would tear him apart!He robbed me of one child;
and now--_Caramba_!Why did you let him go?--why did you, Padre?"Rosendo paced the floor like a caged lion, while great tears rolled
down his black cheeks."But, Rosendo, if you had killed him--what then?Imprisonment for you,
suffering for us all, and the complete wreck of our hopes."_Na_, Padre, but I would have escaped to Guamoco, to the gold I have
discovered.And you would have kept
me supplied; and I would have given you the gold I washed to care for
her--"

The man sank into a chair and buried his head in his hands."_Caramba!_" he moaned."But he will return when I am gone--and the
Church is back of him, and they will come and steal her away--"

How childish, and yet how great he was in his wonderful love, thought
Jose.He pitied him from the bottom of his heart; he loved him
immeasurably; yet he knew the old man's judgment was unsound in this
case."Come, Rosendo," he said gently, laying a hand upon the bent head."This is a time when expediency bids us suffer an evil to remain for a
little while, that a much greater good may follow."Then--"You do not think Diego is her father?""He the father
of that angel-child?_Cielo!_ His brats would be serpents!But I am
losing time--" He turned to the door.What
are you--"

"I am going after Diego!Before sundown
that devil's carcass will be buzzard meat!"If you kill Diego
nothing can save her from Wenceslas!Rosendo, for God's sake,
listen!"But the old man, with his huge strength, tossed the frail priest
lightly aside and rushed into the street.Blind with rage, he did not
see Carmen standing a short distance from the door.The child had been
sent to summon him to breakfast.Unable to check his momentum, the big
man crashed full into her and bore her to the ground beneath him.As
she fell her head struck the sharp edge of an ancient paving stone,
and she lay quite still, while the warm blood slowly trickled through
her long curls.Uttering a frightened cry, Jose rushed to the dazed Rosendo and got
him to his feet.Then he picked up the child, and, his heart numb with
fear, bore her into the house.Clasping Carmen fiercely in his arms, Jose tried to aid Dona Maria in
staunching the freely flowing blood.Rosendo, crazed with grief, bent
over them, giving vent to moans which, despite his own fears, wrung
the priest's heart with pity for the suffering old man.cried Rosendo, kneeling and showering kisses upon her
hands._"Loado sea el buen Dios!"_

"Padre Rosendo," the girl murmured, smiling down at him, "your
thoughts were driving you, just like Benjamin drives his oxen.And
they were bad, or you wouldn't have knocked me over."Rosendo went to the doorway and squatted down upon the dirt
floor in the sunlight."_Caramba_, but they were
murder-thoughts!""And they tried to make you murder me, didn't they, padre dear?""But it didn't really happen, anyway," she added.Rosendo buried his head in his hands and groaned aloud.Carmen slipped
down from Jose's lap and went unsteadily to the old man."They were not yours, those thoughts, padre dear," putting her arms
around his neck."But they were whipping you hard, just as if you
belonged to them.And see, it just shows that bad thoughts can't do
anything.Rosendo reached out and clasped her in his long arms."_Chiquita_," he
cried, "if you were not, your old padre Rosendo would throw himself
into the lake!"She laughed and held up a warning
finger."But I was to tell you the _desayuno_ was ready; and see, we
have forgotten all about it!"Her merry laugh rang through the room
like a silver bell.After breakfast Jose took Rosendo, still shaking, into the parish
house."I think," he said gravely, "that we have learned another
lesson, have we not, _amigo_?"Rosendo's head sank upon his great chest."And, if we are wise, we will profit by it--will we not, _compadre_?"He waited a moment, then continued:

"I have been seeing in a dim way, _amigo_, that our thought is always
the vital thing to be reckoned with, more than we have even suspected
before.I believe there is a mental law, though I cannot formulate it,
that in some way the thoughts we hold use us, and become externalized
in actions.You were wild with fear for Carmen, and your thoughts of
Diego were murderous.Bien, they almost drove you to murder, and they
reacted upon the very one you most love.Can you not see it,
_amigo_?""Padre--I am almost afraid to
think of anything--now.""Ah, _amigo_," said Jose with deep compassion, "I, too, have had a
deep lesson in thinking these past two days.I had evolved many
beautiful theories, and worked out wonderful plans during these weeks
of peace.Then suddenly came the news of the revolution, and, presto!Is it
because she is too young to fear?I think not, _amigo_, I think not.I
think, rather, that it is because she is too wise.""But--she is not of the earth, Padre."The old man shook his head
dubiously.But in some way she
has learned a great truth, and that is that wrong thinking brings all
the discord and woe that afflict the human race.We know this is true,
you and I. In a way we have known it all our lives.But why, _why_ do
we not practice it?Why do I yield so readily to fear; and you to
revenge?I rather think if we loved our enemies we would have none,
for our only enemies are the thoughts that become externalized in
wrong thought-concepts.And even this externalization is only in our
own consciousness.It is there, and only there, that we see evil.""_Quien sabe?_ Padre," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head."We
know so little--so little!""But, Rosendo, we know enough to try to be like Carmen--"

"_Caramba_, yes!But whenever danger
threatens her, the very devils seize me, and I am no longer myself."Jose spoke with the conviction of right, however
inconsistent his past conduct might have been."True, Padre--and I must try to love Diego--I know--though I hate him
as the devil hates the cross!Carmen would say that he was used by bad
thoughts, wouldn't she?"She would not see the man, but the impersonal thought that
seems to use him.And I believe she knows how to meet that kind of
thought."_Bien_, I must try to love him.And--Padre, whenever he comes into my mind I will try to think of him
as God's child--though I know he isn't!""_Hombre!_" he exclaimed."You must not
think of the human Diego as God's child!You must always think of the
_real_ child of God for which this human concept, Diego, stands in
your consciousness.And--_Bien_, now let us talk about the company of militia._Caramba!_ what does he want?"With much oily ceremony and show of affection, Don Mario greeted the
pair."I bring a message from Padre Diego," he announced pompously, after
the exchange of courtesies."Bien, it is quite unfortunate that our
friend Rosendo feels so hard toward him, especially as Don Diego has
so long entrusted Carmen to Rosendo's care.But--his letter, _Senor
Padre_," placing a folded paper in Jose's hand.Silently, but with swelling indignation, Jose read:

  "Dear Brother in Christ: It is, as you must know, because of
  our good Rosendo's foolish anger that I relieve him of the
  embarrassment of my presence in Simiti.Not that I fear bodily
  harm, but lest his thoughtlessness urge him to attempt injury
  upon me; in which case nothing but unhappiness could result, as my
  two <DW64> servants would protect me with their own lives.I
  rather choose peace, and to that end quietly depart.But I
  leave behind my bleeding heart in the little Carmen; and I beg
  that you will at once hand her over to the excellent Don Mario,
  with whom I have made arrangements to have her sent to me in
  due season, whether in Banco or Remedios, I can not at present
  say.I am minded to make an excellent report of your parish to
  Don Wenceslas, and I am sure he will lend you support in your
  labors for the welfare of the good folk of Simiti.Do not forget
  to include the little locket with Carmen's effects when you
  deliver her to Don Mario.I assure you of my warm affection for
  you, and for Rosendo, who mistakes in his zeal to persecute
  me, as he will some day learn; and I commend you both to the
  protecting care of our blessed Mother Mary."I kiss your hand, as your servant in Christ,
                                           "DIEGO GUILLERMO POLO."Jose looked long and fixedly at the Alcalde."Don Mario," he finally
said, "do you believe Diego to be the father of Carmen?""_Cierto_, Padre, I know it!""And what are they, may I ask?""I do not know, Padre; only that he has them.Surely the child is his,
and must be sent to him when he commands.Meantime, you see, he gives
the order to deliver her to me.He has kindly arranged to relieve you
and Rosendo of further care of the girl.""Don Mario," said Jose with terrible earnestness, "I will give you the
benefit of the doubt, and say that Diego has basely deceived you."_Hombre!_ But I can not help if you disbelieve him.Still, you must
comply with his request; otherwise, the Bishop may compel you to do
so."Jose realized the terrible possibility of truth in this statement.For
an instant all his old despair rushed upon him.Rosendo was holding his wrath in splendid check."_Bien_, Don Mario," resumed Jose, after a long meditation."Let us
ask our good Rosendo to leave us for a little moment that we may with
greater freedom discuss the necessary arrangements._Bien, amigo!_"
holding up a hand to check Rosendo, who was rising menacingly before
the Alcalde.He threw Rosendo a significant
look; and the latter, after a momentary hesitation, bowed and passed
out of the room."_A proposito, amigo_," resumed Jose, turning to the Alcalde and
assuming utter indifference with regard to Carmen."As you will
recall, I stood security for Rosendo's debts.The thirty _pesos_ which
he owes you will be ready this evening."The Alcalde smiled genially and rubbed his fat palms together."_Muy
bien_," he murmured.Then:

"But, Don Mario, with regard to Carmen, justice must be done, is it
not so?""_Cierto_, Padre; and Padre Diego has the proofs--"

"Certainly; I accept your word for your conviction in the matter.But
you will agree that there is something to be said for Rosendo.He has
fed, clothed, and sheltered the girl for some eight years.Let us see,
at the rate you charge your _peones_, say, fifty pesos a day, that
would amount to--"

He took paper and pencil from the table and made a few figures.

"--to just fourteen hundred and sixty _pesos oro_," he concluded."This, then, is the amount now due Rosendo for the care of Diego's
child.You say he has made arrangements with you to care for her until
he can send for her._Bien_, we will deliver her to you for Diego,
but only upon payment of the sum which I have just mentioned.Otherwise, how will Rosendo be reimbursed for the expense of her
long maintenance?""_Ca--ram--ba!_ Fourteen hundred and sixty _pesos oro_!ejaculated the outwitted Alcalde, his eyes bulging over his
puffy cheeks."And," continued Jose calmly, "if we deliver the girl to you to-day, I
will retain the thirty _pesos oro_ which Rosendo owes you, and you
will stand surety for the balance of the debt, fourteen hundred and
thirty, in that case.""_Diablo!_ but I will do nothing of the kind!""_Caramba!_ let Diego come and look after his own brat!""Then we shall consider the interview at an end, no?""But my thirty _pesos oro_?"We are still
working together, are we not, Don Mario?"Jose in Simiti with money discounted a million Diegos fleeing through
the jungle.The Alcalde's heavy face melted in a foolish grin."_Cierto, buen Padre!_ and--La Libertad?""I have strong hopes," replied Jose with bland assurance, while a
significant look came into his face.Then he rose and bowed the
Alcalde out."And, Don Mario--"

He put a finger on his lips.

""_Cierto, Padre, cierto!_ I am the grave itself!"As the bulky official waddled off to his little shop, Jose turned back
into his house with a great sigh of relief.Another problem had been
met--temporarily.CHAPTER 17


Within the month Juan brought from Bodega Central the glad news of the
revolution's utter collapse.The anticlerical element, scenting
treachery in their own ranks, and realizing almost from the outset
that the end was a matter of only a few weeks, offered to capitulate
on terms which they felt would be less distressing to their pride than
those which their victors might dictate after inflicting a crushing
defeat.The conservatives did not take advantage of the _fiasco_, but
offered conciliation in the way of reapportioning certain minor public
offices, and a show of somewhat lessened clerical influence.The fires of Jacobinism and popery were again
banked, while priest and politician, statesman and orator set up the
board and rearranged the pawns for the next play.Nothing further had been heard of Padre Diego during the month,
excepting that he had arrived at the settlement of Juncal in a state
of extreme agitation, and had hurriedly set out that same day along
the trail to the San Lucas district.Rosendo, meanwhile, assured that
Diego would not return in the immediate future, yielded to Jose's
persuasion and departed at once for Guamoco on the news of the
revolution's close.Simiti had remained unmolested; and now, with the
assurance of indefinite peace, the old town dropped quickly back into
her wonted state of listless repose, and yielded to the drowsy, dreamy
influences that hover always about this scene of mediaeval romance.Jose had recovered his equipoise; and even when Juan, returning from
his next trip down to the river, brought the priest another sharp
letter from Wenceslas, written in the Bishop's name, he read it
without a tremor.The letter complained of Jose's silence, and
especially of his failure to assist the Catholic cause in this crisal
hour by contributions of Peter's Pence.Nor had any report been
received in Cartagena relative to the state of the parish of Simiti,
its resources and communicants; and not a _peso_ had been offered to
the support of their so dear citadel at a time when its enemies
threatened its gates.Jose smiled happily as he penned his reply, for
he knew that with Rosendo's next return their contributions to
Cartagena would begin.That meant the quieting of Wenceslas,
regardless of whatever report Diego might make.And it was evident
from this letter that neither Diego nor the Alcalde had as yet
communicated anything of a startling nature to Wenceslas regarding
those things to which the priest had consecrated himself in Simiti.To his
little flock he was now preaching the Word of God only as he could
interpret it to meet their simple needs.Gradually, as he got closer
to them, he sought to enlighten them and to draw them at least a
little way out of the dense materialism of their present religious
beliefs.He also strove to give them the best of his own worldly
knowledge, and to this end was talking to them three nights a week in
the church building, where the simple people hung upon his words like
children enwrapped in fairy lore.He was holding regular Sunday
services, and offering Masses during the week for those of his
parishioners who requested them, and who would have been shocked,
puzzled, and unhappy had he refused to do so, or attempted to prove
their uselessness.He was likewise saying diurnal Masses for the
little Maria, to whom, as she lay breathing her last in his arms in
Cartagena, he had given the promise to offer them daily in her behalf
for, a year.Nor was this the extent of his loving sacrifice for the girl.He had
already sent a small sum of money to Catalina by Captain Julio, who
promised to arrange at Calamar for its transmission, and for the safe
convoy of a similar small packet monthly to Cartagena and into the
hands of the two women who were caring for the infant son of Wenceslas
and the ill-fated Maria.He had promised her that night that he would
care for her babe.And his life had long since shown what a promise
meant to him.He knew he would be unable to learn of the child's
progress directly from these women, for they were both illiterate.But
Captain Julio brought an encouraging message from them, and assured
Jose that he would always make inquiry for the babe on his trips down
the river.Jose's long-distance dealings with the genial captain had
been conducted through Juan, who had constituted himself the priest's
faithful servant and the distant worshiper of the child Carmen."Padre Jose," Juan had said one day, striving vainly to hide his
embarrassment, "the little Carmen grows very beautiful.She is like
the Pascua-flower, that shines through the ferns in the _cano_.She is
like the great blue butterfly, that floats on the sunbeams that sift
through the forest trees.""Yes, Juan, she is very beautiful.""Padre, you love her much, is it not so?""And I, Padre, I, too, love her."He paused and dug the hard ground
with his bare toes."Padre," he resumed, "the little Carmen will marry--some day, will she
not?"After all, she was human, and-- But, no, he could not, he would not,
think of it!"Why, Juan--I--cannot say--"

"But, Padre, she will.""And--and, Padre,
I--I should like it if she would marry me.Ah, _Senor Padre_, already
I adore her!"And the
girl would reach the marriageable age of that country in all too short
a time."But, Juan," he remonstrated, "you are too young!And Carmen--why, she
is but a child!"But I am seventeen--and I will wait for her.Only say
now that she shall be mine when the time comes.Jose was deeply touched by the boy's earnest pleading.He put his arm
affectionately about the strong young shoulders."Wait, Juan, and see what develops.And, meanwhile, do you serve her, faithfully, as you see
Rosendo and me doing.""Padre," he exclaimed, "I am her
slave!"Jose went back to his work with Carmen with his thought full of
mingled conjecture and resolve.He had thus far outlined nothing for
the girl's future.Nor had he the faintest idea what the years might
bring forth.But he knew that, in a way, he was aiding in the
preparation of the child for something different from the dull, animal
existence with which she was at present surrounded, and that her path
in life must eventually lead far, far away from the shabby, crumbling
town which now constituted her material world.His task he felt to be
tremendous in the responsibility which it laid upon him.What had he
ever known of the manner of rearing children!He had previously given
the question of child-education but scant consideration, although he
had always held certain radical ideas regarding it; and some of these
he was putting to the test.But had his present work been forecast
while he lay sunken in despair on the river steamer, he would have
repudiated the prediction as a figment of the imagination.Yet the
gleam which flashed through his paralyzed brain that memorable day in
the old church, when Rosendo opened his full heart to him, had roused
him suddenly from his long and despondent lethargy, and worked a quick
and marvelous renovation in his wasted life.Following the lead of
this unusual child, he was now, though with many vicissitudes, slowly
passing out of his prison of egoism, and into the full, clear sunlight
of a world which he knew to be far less material than spiritual.With the awakening had come the almost frenzied desire to realize in
Carmen what he had failed to develop within himself; a vague hope that
she might fill the void which a lifetime of longing had expressed.A
tremendous opportunity now presented.Already the foundation had been
well laid--but not by earthly hands.His task was to build upon it;
and, as he did so, to learn himself.He had never before realized more
than faintly the awful power for good or evil which a parent wields
over a child.He had no more than the slightest conception of the
mighty problem of child-education.And now Carmen herself had shown
him that real education must be reared upon a foundation _wholly
spiritual_.Yet this, he knew, was just what the world's educators did
not do.He could see now how in the world the religious instinct of
the child is early quenched, smothered into complete or partial
extinction beneath the false tutelage of parents and teachers, to whom
years and adult stature are synonymous with wisdom, and who themselves
have learned to see the universe only through the opaque lenses of
matter and chance."If children were not falsely educated to know all manner of evil," he
mused, "what spiritual powers might they not develop in adult life,
powers that are as yet not even imagined!But their primitive
religious instinct is regarded by the worldly-wise parent as but a
part of the infant existence, which must soon give place to the more
solid and real beliefs and opinions which the world in general regards
as established and conventional, even though their end is death.And
so they teach their children to make evil real, even while admonishing
them to protect themselves against it and eventually so to rise as to
overcome it, little realizing that the carnal belief of the reality of
evil which a child is taught to accept permeates its pure thought like
an insidious poison, and becomes externalized in the conventional
routine existence of mind in matter, soul in body, a few brief years
of mingled good and evil, and then darkness--the end here certain; the
future life a vague, impossible conjecture."Jose determined that Carmen's education should be spiritual, largely
because he knew, constituted as she was, it could not well be
otherwise.And he resolved that from his teachings she should glean
nothing but happiness, naught but good.With his own past as a
continual warning, he vowed first that never should the mental germ of
fear be planted within this child's mind.He himself had cringed like
a coward before it all his desolate life.And so his conduct had been
consistently slavish, specious, and his thought stamped with the brand
of the counterfeit.He knew not how much longer he must struggle with
it.But he knew that, if he would progress, the warfare must go on,
until at length he should put it under his feet.His mind still bore
the almost ineradicable mold of the fear deeply graven into it by the
ignorant opinions, the worldly, material, unspiritual beliefs of his
dear but unwise parents.His life had been hedged with baleful shadows
because of it; and over every bright picture there hung its black
draping.As he looked back over the path along which he had come, he
could see every untoward event, every unhappiness and bitter
disappointment, as the externalization of fear in some form, the germ
of which had been early planted in the fertile soil of his plastic
brain.Without it he might have risen to towering heights.Under its
domination he had sunk until the swirling stream of life had eddied
him upon the desolate shores of Simiti.In the hands of the less
fearful he had been a puppet.In his own eyes he was a fear-shaped
manikin, the shadow of God's real man.The fear germ had multiplied
within him a billionfold, and in the abundant crop had yielded a
mental depression and deep-seated melancholy that had utterly stifled
his spirit and dried the marrow of his bones.But now Jose could draw from
them something salutary, something definite to shape and guide his
work with Carmen.She, at least, should not grow up the slave of
fearsome opinions and beliefs born of dense ignorance.Nor should the
baseless figments of puerile religious systems find lodgment within
her clear thought.The fear element, upon which so much of so-called
Christian belief has been reared, and the damnable suggestions of hell
and purgatory, of unpardonable sin and endless suffering, the
stock-in-trade of poet, priest and prelate up to and overlapping our
present brighter day, should remain forever a closed volume to this
child, a book as wildly imaginative and as unacceptable as the fabled
travels of Maundeville."I believe," he would murmur to himself, as he strolled alone in the
dusk beside the limpid lake, "that if I could plant myself firmly on
the Scriptural statement that God is love, that He is good; and if I
could regard Him as infinite mind, while at the same time striving to
recognize no reality, no intelligence or life in things material, I
could eventually triumph over the whole false concept, and rise out of
beliefs of sickness, discord, and death, into an unalterable
consciousness of good only."He had made a beginning when he strove to realize that man is not
separated from God; that God is not a far-off abstraction; and that
infinite mind is, as Carmen insisted, "everywhere.""It is only the five physical senses that tell us evil is real," he
reflected."Indeed, without their testimony we would be utterly
unconscious of evil!And I am convinced that their testimony is
specious, and that we see, hear, and feel only in thought, or in
belief.We think the sensations of seeing, hearing, and feeling come
to us through the medium of these senses as outward, fleshly
contrivances, which in some way communicate with the mind and bridge
the gulf between the material and the mental.In reality, we do but
see, hear and feel _our own thoughts_!The philosophers, many of them,
said as much centuries ago.But--the human mind has been
mesmerized, simply mesmerized!"These things he pondered day by day, and watched to see them wrought
out in the life of Carmen."Ah, yes," he would sometimes say, as
spiritual ideas unfolded to him, "you evolve beautiful theories, my
good Jose, and you say many brave things.But, when the day of
judgment comes, as it did when Juan brought you the news of the
revolution, then, alas!your theories fly to pieces, and you find
yourself very human, very material, and your God hidden behind the
distant clouds.When the test comes, you find you cannot prove your
beliefs."Yet the man did not often indulge in self-condemnation, for somehow he
knew his ideas were right.When he realized the character and specious
nature of evil, and realized, too, that "by thy words thou shalt be
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned," he knew that the
stirring up of evil by good, and the shaking of the ancient
foundations of carnal belief within his mentality, might mean fiery
trials, still awaiting him.And yet, the crown was for him who should
overcome.The false opinions of mankind, the ignorant
beliefs in matter and evil.For what, after all, is responsible for
all the evil in this world of ours?"And if I keep my nose buried forever in matter, how can I hope to see
God, who is Spirit?And how can I follow the Christ unless I think as
he thought?"But it was in the classroom with Carmen that he always received his
greatest stimulus."See, Padre dear," she said one day, "if I erase a wrong figure and
then set down the right one instead, I get the right answer.And it is
just like that when we think.If we always put good thoughts in the
place of the bad ones, why, everything comes out right, doesn't it?""Of course, _chiquita_," he
replied."Only in your algebra you know which are the right figures to
put down.But how do you know which thoughts are right?"I can't make even the least mistake about the
thoughts.Why, it is easier to mistake with figures than it is with
thoughts.""Because, if you always think God _first_, you can never think wrong.And if you think of other things first you are almost
sure to think of the wrong thing, is it not so, Padre?"The priest had to admit the force of her statement."And, you know, Padre dear," the girl went on, "when I understand the
right rule in algebra, the answer just comes of itself.Well, it is so
with everything when we understand that God is the right rule--you
call Him principle, don't you?--well, when we know that He is the only
rule for everything, then the answers to all our problems just come of
themselves."Aye, thought Jose, the healing works of the great Master were only the
"signs following," the "answers" to the people's problems, the sure
evidence that Jesus understood the Christ-principle."And when you say that God is the right rule for everything, just what
do you mean, _chiquita_?""That He is everywhere," the girl replied."That He is infinite and omnipresent good, then?""He is good--and everywhere," the child repeated firmly."And the necessary corollary of that is, that there is no evil," Jose
added."I don't know what you mean by corollary, Padre dear.It's a big word,
isn't it?""I mean--I think I know how you would put it, little one--if God is
everywhere, then there is nothing bad.He saw that a fact can have no real opposite; that
any predicated opposite must be supposition.And evil is the
supposition; whereas good is the fact.The latter is "plus," and the
former "minus."No wonder the origin of evil has never been found,
although humanity has struggled with the problem for untold ages!He gave it the minus sign, the sign of
nothingness.The world has tried to make it positive, something.From
the false sense of evil as a reality has come the equally false sense
of man's estrangement from God, through some fictitious "fall"--a
curse, truly, upon the human intellect, but not of God's infliction.For false belief always curses with a reign of discord, which endures
until the belief becomes corrected by truth.From the beginning, the
human race has vainly sought to postulate an equal and opposite to
everything in the realm of both the spiritual and material.It has
been hypnotized, obsessed, blinded, by this false zeal.The resultant
belief in "dualism" has rendered hate the equal and opposite of Love,
evil the equal and opposite of Good, and discord the eternal opponent
of Harmony.To cope with evil as a reality is to render it immortal in
our consciousness.To know its unreality is to master it."Throughout life," Jose mused, "every positive has its negative, every
affirmation its denial.And, moreover,
the positive always dispels the negative, thus proving the specious
nature of the latter.Darkness flees before the light, and ignorance
dissolves in the morning rays of knowledge.The
positive alone bears the stamp of immortality.Carmen has but one
fundamental rule: _God is everywhere_.This gives her a sense of
immanent power, with which all things are possible."Thus with study and meditation the days flowed past, with scarcely a
ripple to break their quiet monotony.He
brought back at the end of his first month's labors on the newly
discovered deposit some ninety _pesos_ in gold.He had reached the
bedrock, and the deposit was yielding its maximum; but the yield would
continue for many months, he said.His exultation overleaped all
bounds, and it was with difficulty that Jose could bring him to a
consideration of the problems still confronting them."I think, Rosendo," said the priest, "that we will send, say, thirty
_pesos_ this month to Cartagena; the same next month; and then
increase the amount slightly.This method is sure to have a beneficial
effect upon the ecclesiastical authorities there.""And how will you send it, Padre?""We cannot send the gold direct to the
Bishop, for that would excite suspicion.Masses, you know, are not
paid for in gold dust and nuggets.Nor could we
get the gold exchanged for bills here in Simiti, even if we dared run
the risk of our discovery becoming known."For the Alcalde was already nosing about in an effort to ascertain the
source of the gold with which Rosendo had just cancelled his debt and
purchased further supplies.Jose now saw that, under existing
conditions, it would be utterly impossible for Rosendo to obtain
titles to mineral properties through Don Mario.He spent hours seeking
a solution of the involved problem.Then, just before Rosendo departed
again for the mountains, Jose called him into the parish house."Rosendo, I think I see a way.Bring me one of the paper boxes of
candles which you have just purchased from Don Mario."Padre," queried the surprised Rosendo, as he returned with
the box, "and what is this for?""I merely want to get the name of the firm which sold the candles.The
Empresa Alemania, Barranquilla.I have a method that
is roundabout, but certainly promises much.I will write to the firm,
appointing them my agents while I pose as Jose Rincon, miner.The
agency established, I will send them our gold each month, asking them
to return to me its equivalent in bills, deducting, of course, their
commission.Then I will send these bills, or such part as we deem
wise, to Wenceslas.Each month Juan, who will be sworn to secrecy,
will convey the gold to Bodega Central in time to meet Captain Julio's
boat.The captain will both deliver the gold to the Empresa Alemania,
and bring back the bills in exchange.Then, from Simiti, and in the
regular manner, I will send the small packet of bills to Wenceslas as
contributions from the parish.We thus throw Don Mario off the scent,
and arouse no suspicion in any quarter.As I receive mail matter at
various times, the Alcalde will not know but what I also receive
consignments of money from my own sources.And so, as it was arranged, it worked out.Juan reveled in the honor
of such intimate relations with the priest and Rosendo, and especially
in the thought that he was working in secret for the girl he adored.By the time Rosendo returned again from Guamoco, Jose had sent his
first consignment of money to the Bishop, carefully directing it to
Wenceslas, personally, and had received an acknowledgment in a letter
which caused him deep thought."To further stimulate the piety of your communicants," it read,
  "and arouse them to more generous contributions to our glorious
  cause, you will inform them that, if their monetary contributions
  do not diminish in amount for the coming year, they will be made
  participants in the four solemn Novenas which will be offered
  by His Grace, the Bishop of Cartagena.Moreover, if their
  contributions increase, the names of the various contributors will
  be included in the one hundred Masses which are to be offered
  in December at the Shrine of Our Lady of Chiquinquia for their
  spiritual and temporal welfare.Contributors will also have a High
  Mass after death, offered by one of His Grace's assistants, as
  soon as the notification of death is received here.In addition
  to these, His Grace, always mindful of the former importance of
  the parish of Simiti, and acknowledging as its special patron
  the ever blessed Virgin, has arranged to bestow the episcopal
  blessing upon an image of the Sacred Heart, which will be shipped
  to his faithful children in Simiti when the amount of their
  contributions shall have met the expense thereof.Let us keep ever
  in mind the pious words of the Bl.Margaret Mary, who has
  conveyed to us the assurance which she received directly from Our
  Blessed Lord that He finds great joy in beholding His Sacred
  Heart visibly represented, that it may touch the hard hearts
  of mankind.Our blessed Saviour promised the gracious Margaret
  Mary that He would pour out abundantly of His rich treasure upon
  all who honor this image, and that it shall draw down from heaven
  every blessing upon those who adore and reverence it.Inform your
  parishioners that the recital of the offering, 'O, Sacred Heart
  of Jesus, may it be everywhere adored!'carries a hundred days'
  indulgence each time."You will bear in mind that the General Intention for this month
  is The Conversion of America.Though our Church is founded on the
  Rock, and is to last forever, so that the gates of hell shall
  never prevail against her, nevertheless she has been called upon
  to withstand many assaults from her enemies, the advocates of
  _modernism_, in the land of liberal thought to our north.These
  assaults, though painful to her, can never be fatal to her
  spiritual life, although they unfortunately are so to many of her
  dear children, who yield to the insidious persuasions of the
  heretics who do the work of Satan among the Lord's sheep.New and
  fantastic religions are springing up like noxious weeds in America
  of the north, and increasing infidelity is apparent on every hand.The Christ prayed that there might be one fold and one shepherd.It is for us this month to pray for the great day when they will
  be accomplished.But we must be united over the interests of the
  Sacred Heart.Therefore, liberal plenary indulgences will be
  granted to those of the faithful who contribute to this glorious
  cause, so dear to the heart of the blessed Saviour.We enclose
  leaflets indicating the three degrees, consisting of the Morning
  Offering, Our Father and ten Hail Marys daily, for the Pope and
  his interests, and the degree of reparation, by which a plenary
  indulgence may be gained."Stimulate your parishioners to compete joyfully for the statue of
  the Blessed Virgin, which we mentioned to you in our former
  communication.Teach them, especially, their entire dependence on
  Mary, on her prayers to God for their deliverance and welfare.Reveal to them her singularly powerful influence in the shaping of
  all great historical events of the world; how never has she
  refused our prayers to exert her mighty influence with her
  all-potent Son, when she has been appealed to in sincerity, for it
  rejoices the Sacred Heart of Jesus to yield to the requests of His
  Blessed Mother.Mary is omnipotent, for she can ask no favor of
  her Son that He will not grant.Competition for possession of this
  sacred image, which carries the potent blessing of His Holiness,
  should be regarded a privilege, and you will so impress it upon
  the minds of your parishioners."Finally, His Grace requests that you will immediately procure
  whatever information you may regarding the mineral resources of
  the district of Guamoco, and indicate upon a sketch the location
  of its various mines, old or new, as known to its inhabitants.Diligent and careful inquiry made by yourself among the people of
  the district will reveal many hidden facts regarding its
  resources, which should be made known to His Grace at the earliest
  possible moment, in view of the active preparations now in
  progress to forestall the precipitation of another political
  uprising with its consequent strain upon our Holy Church.""One would think the Christ had
established his Church solely for gold!"He folded the letter and looked out through the rear door to where
Carmen sat, teaching Cucumbra a new trick.He realized then that never
before had he been so far from the Holy Catholic faith as at that
moment.he muttered, as his eyes rested upon the child."If the
Church should get possession of Carmen, what would it do with her?Would it not set its forces to work to teach her that evil is a
reality--that it is as powerful as good--that God formed man and the
universe out of dust--that Jesus came down from a starry heaven that
he might die to appease the wrath of a man-like Father--that Mary
pleads with the Lord and Jesus, and by her powerful logic induces them
to spare mankind and grant their foolish desires--all the dribble and
rubbish of outlandish theology that has accumulated around the nucleus
of pure Christianity like a gathering snowball throughout the ages!To
make the great States up north dominantly Catholic, Rome must--simply
_must_--have the children to educate, that she may saturate their
absorbent minds with these puerile, undemonstrable, pagan beliefs
before the child has developed its own independent thought.How wise
is she--God, how worldly wise and cunning!And I still her priest--"

Carmen came bounding in, followed pellmell by Cucumbra.Cantar-las-horas
stalked dignifiedly after her, and stopped at the threshold, where he
stood with cocked head and blinking eyes, wondering what move his
animated young mistress would make next.she exclaimed, "the sun is down, and it is time for our
walk!"She seized his hand and drew him out into the road.The play of her
expression as she looked up and laughed into his face was like the
dance of sunbeams on moving water.They turned down the narrow street
which led to the lake.As was her wont, in every object about her, in
every trifling event, the child discovered rich treasures of
happiness.The pebbles which she tossed with her bare toes were mines
of delight.The pigs, which turned up their snouts expectantly as she
stooped to scratch their dusty backs--the matronly hens that followed
clucking after her--the black babies that toddled out to greet the
_Cura_--all yielded a wealth of delight and interest.She seemed to
Jose to uncover joy by a means not unlike the divining rod, which
points to hidden gold where to the eye there is naught but barren
ground.Near the margin of the lake they stopped at the door of a cottage,
where they were awaited by the matron who displayed a finger wrapped
in a bit of cloth."_Senor Padre_," she said, "this morning I had the misfortune to cut
my finger while peeling yuccas, and I am not sure whether a piece of
the skin went into the pot or not._Bueno_, the yuccas are all cooked;
and now my man says he will not eat them, for this is Friday, and
there may be meat with the yuccas.Was it wicked to
cook the yuccas, not knowing if a bit of the skin from my finger had
fallen into the pot?"Jose stood dumfounded before such ignorant credulity.Then he shook
his head and replied sadly, "No, senora, it was not wicked.Tell your
man he may eat the yuccas."The woman's face brightened, and she hastened into the house to
apprise her spouse of the _Cura's_ decision."Two thousand years of
Christianity, and still the world knows not what Jesus taught!""But you told me he had good thoughts, Padre dear," said the little
voice at his side, as he walked slowly away with bended head."Because, Padre, if he had good thoughts, he thought about God--didn't
he?And if he thought about God, he always thought of something good.And if we always think about good--well, isn't that enough?"She almost invariably framed her
replies with an interrogation, and, whether he would or not, he must
perforce give answers which he knew in his heart were right, and yet
which the sight of his eyes all too frequently denied."Padre, you are not thinking about God now--are you?""Well--perhaps you are thinking _about_ Him; but you are not thinking
_with_ Him--are you?--the way He thinks.You know, He sends us His
thoughts, and we have to pick them out from all the others that aren't
His, and then think them.If the senora and her man had been thinking
God's thoughts, they wouldn't have been afraid to eat a piece of meat
on Friday--would they?"Cucumbra, forgetting his many months of instruction, suddenly yielded
to the goad of animal instinct and started along the beach in mad
pursuit of a squealing pig.As Jose watched
her lithe, active little body bobbing over the shales behind the
flying animals, she seemed to him like an animated sunbeam sporting
among the shadows."Why should life," he murmured aloud, "beginning in radiance, proceed
in ever deepening gloom, and end at last in black night?Why, but for
the false education in evil which is inflicted upon us!The joys, the
unbounded bliss of childhood, do indeed gush from its innocence--its
innocence of the blighting belief in mixed good and evil--innocence of
the false beliefs, the undemonstrable opinions, the mad worldly
ambitions, the carnal lust, bloated pride, and black ignorance of men!It all comes from not knowing God, to know whom is life eternal!The
struggle and mad strife of man--what does it all amount to, when 'in
the end he shall be a fool'?Do we in this latest of the centuries,
with all our boasted progress in knowledge, really know so much, after
all?"Come, Padre," cried Carmen, returning to him, "we are going to just
try now to have all the nice thoughts we can.Let's just look all
around us and see if we can't think good thoughts about everything.And, do you know, Padre dear, I've tried it, and when I look at things
and something tries to make me see if there could possibly be anything
bad about them--why, I find there can't!Try it, and see for
yourself."He knew that the minds of men are so profaned by
constantly looking at evil that their thoughts are tinged with it.But in doing so he was combating a habit
grown mighty by years of indulgence."When you always think good about a thing," the girl went on, "you
never can tell what it will do.If things look bad, I just say, 'Why look,
here's something trying to tell me that two and two are seven!'"Your purity and goodness resist evil involuntarily, little one," said
Jose, more to himself than to the child."Why, Padre, what big words!""No, little one, it is just the meaning of the words that is big," he
replied.Then:

"Padre dear, I never thought of it before--but it is true: we don't
see the meaning of words with the same eyes that we see trees and
stones and people, do we?""I don't quite understand what you mean,
_chiquita_," he was finally forced to answer."Well," she resumed, "the meaning of a word isn't something that we
can pick up, like a stone; or see, as we see the lake out there.""No, Carmen, the meaning is spiritual--mental; it is not physically
tangible.It is not seen with the fleshly eyes.""The meaning of a word is the inside of it, isn't it?""Yes, it is the inside, the soul, of the word.""And we don't see the word, either, do we?"She shook her brown curls
in vigorous negation."No, little one, we see only written or printed symbols; or hear only
sounds that convey to us the words."But, Padre dear," she
continued, "the inside, or soul, of everything is mental.The things we think we see are only symbols."Padre, they don't stand for anything!""Padre, the real things are the things we don't see.And the things we
think we see are not real at all!"Jose had ere this learned not to deny her rugged statements, but to
study them for their inner meaning, which the child often found too
deep for her limited vocabulary to express."The things we think we see," he said, though he was addressing his
own thought, "are called the physical.The things we do not see or
cognize with the physical senses are called mental, or spiritual.he queried, looking down again into the serious little face."Padre, the very greatest things are those that we don't see at all!"Love, life, joy, knowledge, wisdom, health,
harmony--all these are spiritual ideas.The physical sometimes
manifests them--and sometimes does not.And in the end, called death,
it ceases altogether to manifest them.""But--these things--the very greatest things there are--are the souls
of everything--is it not so, Padre dear?""It must be, _chiquita_.""And all these things came from God, and He is everywhere, and so He
is the soul of everything, no?""Padre--don't you see it?--we are not seeing things all around us!We
don't see real things that we call trees and stones and people!We see
only what we _think_ we see.We see things that are not there at all!We see--"

"Yes, we see only our thoughts.And we think we see them as objects
all about us, as trees, and houses, and people.But in the final
analysis we see only thoughts," he finished."But these thoughts do not come from God," she insisted."No," he replied slowly, "because they often manifest discord and
error.I think I grasp what is struggling in your mind _chiquita_.God
is--"

"Everywhere," she interrupted."He is everywhere, and therefore He is the soul--the inside--the heart
and core--of everything.He is mind, and His thoughts are real, and
are the only real thoughts there are.But, in reality, truth cannot have an opposite.And so the thought that we seem to
see externalized all about us, and that we call physical objects, is
supposition only.And, a supposition being unreal, the whole physical
universe, including material man, is unreal--is a supposition, a
supposition of mixed good and evil, for it manifests both.And, since a lie has no real existence, this human
concept of a universe and mankind composed of matter is utterly
unreal, an image of thought, an illusion, existing in false thought
only--a belief--a supposition pure and simple!"As he talked he grew more and more animated.He seemed to forget the
presence of the child, and appeared to be addressing only his own
insistent questionings.They walked along together in silence for some moments.Then the girl
again took up the conversation."Padre," she said, "you know, you taught me to prove my problems in
arithmetic and algebra.Well, I have proved something about thinking,
too.If I think a thing, and just keep thinking it, pretty soon I see
it--in some way--outside of me."A light seemed to flash through Jose's mental chambers, and he
recalled the words of the explorer in Cartagena.Yes, that was exactly
what he had said--"every thought that comes into the mind tends to
become _externalized_, either upon the body as a physical condition,
or in the environment, or as an event, good or bad."It was a law,
dimly perceived, but nevertheless sufficiently understood in its
workings to indicate a tremendous field as yet all but unknown.The
explorer had called it the law of the externalization of thought."As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he," said the Master, twenty
centuries before.Had his own wrong thinking, or the
wrong thought of others, been the cause of his unhappiness and acute
mental suffering?What difference whether it
be called his, or the Archbishop's, or whose?Let it suffice that it
was false thought, undirected by the Christ-principle, God, that had
been externalized in the wreckage which he now called his past life.He again stood face to face with the most momentous question ever
propounded by a waiting world: the question of causation.And he knew
now that causation was wholly spiritual."Padre dear, you said just now that God was mind.But, if that is
true, there is only one mind, for God is everywhere.""It must be so, _chiquita_," dreamily responded the priest."Then He is your mind and my mind, is it not so?""Yes--"

"Then, if He is my mind, there just isn't anything good that I can't
do."Twilight does not linger in the tropics, and already the shadows that
stole down through the valley had wrapped the man and child in their
mystic folds."Padre, if God is my mind, He will do my thinking for me.And all I
have to do is to keep the door open and let His thoughts come in."Her sweet voice lingered on the still night air.There was a pensive
gladness in the man's heart as he tightly held her little hand and led
her to Rosendo's door.CHAPTER 18


The next morning Jose read to Rosendo portions of the communication
from Wenceslas."Chiquinquia," commented the latter."I remember that Padre Diego
collected much money from our people for Masses to be said at that
shrine.""Why, there
is not a shrine in the whole of Colombia that works so many cures as
this one.Your grandfather, Don Ignacio, knew the place.And it was
from him that my--that is, I learned the legend when I was only a boy.It is said that a poor, sick young girl in the little Indian village
of Chiquinquia, north of Bogota, stood praying in her shabby little
cottage before an old, torn picture of the blessed Virgin."Then he resumed:

"_Bueno_, while the girl prayed, the picture suddenly rose up in the
air; the torn places all closed; the faded colors came again as fresh
as ever; and the girl was cured of her affliction.The people of the
village immediately built a shrine, over which they hung the picture;
and ever since then the most wonderful miracles have been performed by
it there.""You don't believe that, do you, Rosendo?"Did
not Don Felipe go there when the doctor in Mompox told him the little
white spot on his hand was leprosy?Jose started as if he had received a blow.He looked
furtively at the scar on his own hand, the hand which the leper in
Maganguey had lacerated that dreadful night, and which often burned
and ached as if seared by a hot iron.He had never dared to voice the
carking fear that tightened about his heart at times.But often in the
depths of night, when dread anticipation sat like a spectre upon his
bed, he had risen and gone out into the darkness to wrestle with his
black thoughts.All the gladness and joy left his heart, and
a pall of darkness settled over his thought.He turned back into his
cottage and tried to find forgetfulness in the simple duties that lay
at hand."Why is it," he asked himself, as he sat wearily down at his little
table, "that I always think of evil first; while Carmen's first
thought is invariably of God?"He looked at the ugly scar on his hand.What thought was externalized
in the loathsome experience which produced that?Was it
the summation of all the fear, the weakness, the wrong belief, that
had filled his previous years?And now why was he finding it so
difficult to practice what Carmen lived, even though he knew it was
truth?he murmured aloud, "it was the seminary that did it.For there
my thought was educated away from the simple teachings of Jesus.To
Carmen there is no mystery in godliness.Though she knows utterly
nothing about Jesus, yet she hourly uses the Christ-principle.It is
the children who grasp the simple truths of God; while the lack of
spirituality which results from increasing years shrinks maturer minds
until they no longer afford entrance to it.For godliness is broad;
and the mind that receives it must be opened wide."As he sat with his bowed head clasped in his hands, a sweet, airy
voice greeted him."Why, Padre dear--ah, I caught you that time!--you were thinking that
two and two are seven, weren't you?"She shook a rebuking finger at
him.Framed in the doorway like an old masterpiece, the sunlight bronzing
her heavy brown curls, the olive-tinted skin of her bare arms and legs
flushing with health, and her cheap calico gown held tightly about
her, showing the contour of her full and shapely figure, the girl
appeared to Jose like a vision from the realm of enchantment.And he
knew that she did dwell in the land of spiritual enchantment, where
happiness is not at the mercy of physical sense."He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?""The Lord our God is a right-thinking God, and right-thinking is what
He desires in His people."Jose thought of this as he looked at Carmen.This barefoot girl, who
walked humbly, trustingly, with her God, had she not supplied him with
a working formula for his every problem, even to the casting out of
the corroding fear planted in his heart by that awful experience in
Maganguey?Though he had suffered much, yet much had been done for
him.The brusque logic of the explorer had swept his mind clear of its
last vestige of theological superstition, and prepared it for the
truth which, under the benign stimulus of this clear-minded child,
would remake his life, if he could now yield himself utterly to it.He
must--he would--ceaselessly strive, even though he fell daily, to make
his life a pattern of hers, wherein there was no knowledge of evil!The girl came to the priest and leaned fondly against him.Then a
little sigh escaped her lips, as she looked down into his face with
pitying affection."Padre dear," she said, in a tone that echoed a strain of sadness,
"I--I don't believe--you love God very much."The man was startled, and resentment began to well in his heart."What
a thing to say, Carmen!"The girl looked up at him with great, wondering eyes."But, Padre,"
she protested, "were you not thinking of things that are not true when
I came in?""No--I was--I was thinking of the future--of--well, _chiquita_, I was
thinking of something that might happen some day, that is all."He
stumbled through it with difficulty, for he knew he must not lie to
the child.Would she ever trust him again if he did?"And, Padre, were you afraid?"Yes, _chiquita_, I was."Carmen looked at him reproachfully."Then, Padre, I was right--for, if
you loved God, you would trust Him--and then you couldn't be afraid of
anything--could you?"Ah, child," he murmured, "you will find that
out in the world people don't love God in this day and generation.At
least they don't love Him that way.""They don't love Him enough to trust him?""Nobody trusts Him, not even the
preachers themselves.When things happen, they rush for a doctor, or
some other human being to help them out of their difficulty.They
don't turn to Him any more.she asked slowly, her voice sinking to a
whisper.Then:

"What made them forget Him, Padre?""I guess, _chiquita_, they turned from Him because He didn't answer
their prayers.You mean--"

"I asked Him for things--to help me out of trouble--I asked Him to
give me--"

"Why, Padre!What are you
trying to tell me, child?""Why, He is everywhere, and He is right here all the time.And so
there couldn't be any real trouble for Him to help you out of; and He
couldn't give you anything, for He has already done that, long ago.We
are in Him, don't you know?And so when you asked Him for things it showed that you didn't believe
He had already given them to you.And--you know what you said last
night about thinking, and that when we think things, we see them?Well, He has given you everything; but you thought He hadn't, and so
you saw it that way--isn't it so?"But
before he could reply she resumed:

"Padre dear, you know you told me that Jesus was the best man that
ever lived, and that it was because he never had a bad thought--isn't
that so?""Well, did he pray--did he ask God for things?"Why, he was always praying--the New Testament is full of
it!"Acting on a sudden impulse, he rose and went into the sleeping room
to get his Bible.The child's face took on an expression of
disappointment as she heard his words.Her brow knotted, and a
troubled look came into her brown eyes.Jose returned with his Bible and seated himself again at the table.Opening the book, his eyes fell upon a verse of Mark's Gospel.He
stopped to read it; and then read it again.Suddenly he looked up at
the waiting girl.He read the verse again; then he scanned the child
closely, as if he would read a mystery hidden within her bodily
presence.Abruptly he turned to the book and read aloud:

"'Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.'"The girl drew a long breath, almost a sigh, as if a weight had been
removed from her mind."Yes--at least it is so reported here," he answered absently."Well--_he_ knew, didn't he?""Why, Padre, he told the people to know--just _know_--that they
already had everything--that God had given them everything good--and
that if they would _know_ it, they would see it."Yes; or rather, the externalization of
truth.Jose fell into abstraction, his eyes glued to the page.There
it stood--the words almost shouted it at him!And there it had stood
for nearly two thousand years, while priest and prelate, scribe and
commentator had gone over it again and again through the ages, without
even guessing its true meaning--without even the remotest idea of the
infinite riches it held for mankind!He turned reflectively to Matthew; and then to John.He remembered the
passages well--in the past he had spent hours of mortal agony poring
over them and wondering bitterly why God had failed to keep the
promises they contain."And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
shall receive."All things--when ye ask _believing_!But that Greek word surely held
vastly more than the translators have drawn from it.Nay, not
believing only, but _understanding_ the allness of God as good, and
the consequent nothingness of evil, all that seems to oppose Him!How
could the translators have so completely missed the mark!And
Carmen--had never seen a Bible until he came into her life; yet she
knew, knew instinctively, that a good God who was "everywhere" could
not possibly withhold anything good from His children.It was the
simplest kind of logic.But, thought Jose again, if the promises are kept, why have we fallen
so woefully short of their realization?Then he read again, "If ye
abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
it shall be done unto you."The promise carries a condition--abiding
in his words--obeying his commands--keeping the very _first_
Commandment, which is that "Ye shall have no other gods before me"--no
gods of evil, sickness, chance, or death.The promises are fulfilled
only on the condition of righteousness--right-thinking about God and
His infinite, spiritual manifestation."_Chiquita_," he said tenderly, "you never ask
God to give you things, do you?""Why, no, Padre; why should I?He gives me everything I need, doesn't
He?""Yes--when you go out to the shales, you--"

"I don't ask Him for things, Padre dear.I just tell Him I _know_ He
is everywhere.""I see--yes, you told me that long ago--I understand, _chiquita_."His spirit bowed in humble reverence before such divine faith.This
untutored, unlearned girl, isolated upon these burning shales, far,
far from the haunts of men of pride and power and worldly lore--this
barefoot child whose coffers held of material riches scarce more than
the little calico dress upon her back--this lowly being knew that
which all the fabled wealth of Ind could never buy!Her prayers were
not the selfish pleadings that spring from narrow souls, the souls
that "ask amiss"--not the frenzied yearnings wrung from suffering,
ignorant hearts--nor were they the inflated instructions addressed
to the Almighty by a smug, complacent clergy, the self-constituted
press-bureau of infinite Wisdom.Her prayers, which so often drifted
like sweetest incense about those steaming shales, were not
petitions, but _affirmations_.She simply _knew_ that He had already met her needs.And that righteousness--right-thinking--became externalized in her
consciousness in the good she sought.Jesus did the same thing, over
and over again; but the poor, stupid minds of the people were so
full of wrong beliefs about his infinite Father that they could not
understand, no, not even when he called Lazarus from the tomb."Ask in my name," urged the patient Jesus.But the poor fishermen
thought he meant his human name to be a talisman, a sort of "Open
Sesame," when he was striving all the time, by precept and deed, to
show them that they must ask in his _character_, must be like him, to
whom, though of himself he could do nothing, yet all things were
possible.Jose's heart began to echo the Master's words: "Father, I thank Thee
that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes."He put his arm about Carmen and drew her to
him."Little one," he murmured, "how much has happened in these past few
weeks!"Carmen looked up at him with an enigmatical glance and laughed."Well,
Padre dear, I don't think anything ever really _happens_, do you?""Mistakes happen, as in solving my algebra problems.But good things
never happen, any more than the answers to my problems happen.You
know, there are rules for getting the answers; but there are no rules
for making mistakes--are there?But when anything comes out according
to the rule, it doesn't happen.And the mistakes, which have no rules,
are not real--the answers are real, but the mistakes are not--and so
nothing ever really happens."Surely, I see," he acquiesced.Then, while he held the girl close to
him, he reflected: Good is never fortuitous.It results from the
application of the Principle of all things.The answer to a
mathematical problem is a form of good, and it results from the
application of the principle of mathematics.Mistakes, and the various
things which "happen" when we solve mathematical problems, do not have
rules, or principles.They result from ignorance of them, or their
misapplication.And so in life; for chance, fate, luck, accident and
the merely casual, come, not from the application of principles, but
from not applying them, or from ignorance of their use.The human mind
or consciousness, which is a mental activity, an activity of thought,
is concerned with mixed thoughts of good and evil.But _it operates
without any principle whatsoever_.For, if God is infinite good, then
the beliefs of evil which the human mind holds must be false beliefs,
illusions, suppositions.A supposition has no principle, no rule.And
so, it is only the unreal that happens.And even that sort of
"happening" can be prevented by knowing and using the principle of all
good, God.A knowledge of evil is not knowledge at all.But we are neglecting our work," he
hastily added, as he roused himself."What are the lessons for to-day?And arranging his papers, and bidding
Carmen draw up to the table, he began the morning session of his very
select little school.*       *       *       *       *

More than six months had elapsed since Jose first set foot upon the
hot shales of Simiti.In that time his mentality had been turned over
like a fallow field beneath the plowshare.After peace had been
established in the country he had often thought to consecrate himself
to the task of collecting the fragmentary ideas which had been evolved
in his mind during these past weeks of strange and almost weird
experience, and trying to formulate them into definite statements of
truth.Then he would enter upon the task of establishing them by
actual demonstration, regardless of the years that might be required
to do so.He realized now that the explorer had done a great work in
clearing his mind of many of its darker shadows.But it was to
Carmen's purer, more spiritual influence that he knew his debt was
heaviest.Let it not seem strange that mature manhood and extensive travel had
never before brought to this man's mind the truths, many of which have
been current almost since the curtain first arose on the melodrama
of mundane existence.Well nigh impassable limitations had been
set to them by his own natal characteristics; by his acutely morbid
sense of filial love which bound him, at whatever cost, to observe
the bigoted, selfish wishes of his parents; and by the strictness
with which his mind had been hedged about both in the seminary and
in the ecclesiastical office where he subsequently labored.The
first rays of mental freedom did not dawn upon his darkened thought
until he was sent as an outcast to the New World.Then, when his
greater latitude in Cartagena, and his still more expanded sense of
freedom in Simiti, had lowered the bars, there had rushed into his
mentality such a flood of ideas that he was all but swept away in the
swirling current.It is not strange that he rose and fell, to-day strong in the
conviction of the immanence of infinite good, to-morrow sunken in
mortal despair of ever demonstrating the truth of the ideas which were
swelling his shrunken mind.His line of progress in truth was an
undulating curve, slowly advancing toward the distant goal to which
Carmen seemed to move in a straight, undeviating line.What though
Emerson had said that Mind was "the only reality of which men and all
other natures are better or worse reflectors"?Jose was unaware of the
sage's mighty deduction.What though Plato had said that we move as
shadows in a world of ideas?Even if Jose had known of it, it had
meant nothing to him.What though the Transcendentalists called the
universe "a metaphore of the human mind"?Jose's thought was too
firmly clutched by his self-centered, material beliefs to grasp it.Doubt of the reality of things material succumbed to the evidence of
the physical senses and the ridicule of his seminary preceptors.True,
he believed with Paul, that the "things that are seen are temporal;
the things that are unseen, are eternal."But this pregnant utterance
conveyed nothing more to him than a belief of a material heaven to
follow his exit from a world of matter.It had never occurred to him
that the world of matter might be the product of those same delusive
physical senses, through which he believed he gained his knowledge of
it.It is true that while in the seminary, and before, he had insisted
upon a more spiritual interpretation of the mission of Jesus--had
insisted that Christian priests should obey the Master's injunction,
and heal the sick as well as preach the gospel.But with the advent of
the troubles which filled the intervening years, these things had
gradually faded; and the mounting sun that dawned upon him six months
before, as he lay on the damp floor of his little cell in the
ecclesiastical dormitory in Cartagena, awaiting the Bishop's summons,
illumined only a shell, in which agnosticism sat enthroned upon a
stool of black despair.And her beautiful love, which enfolded
him like a garment, and her sublime faith, which moved before him like
the Bethlehem star to where the Christ-principle lay, were, little by
little, dissolving the mist and revealing the majesty of the great
God.In assuming to teach the child, Jose early found that the outer world
meant nothing to her until he had purged it of its carnal elements.Often in days past, when he had launched out upon the dramatic recital
of some important historical event, wherein crime and bloodshed had
shaped the incident, the girl would start hastily from her chair and
put her little hand over his mouth."God didn't do
it, and it isn't so!"And thereby he learned to differentiate more closely between those
historical events which sprang from good motives, and those which
manifested only human passion, selfish ambition, and the primitive
question, "Who shall be greatest?"Moreover, he had found it best in
his frequent talks to the people in the church during the week to omit
all reference to the evil methods of mankind in their dealings one
with another, and to pass over in silence the criminal aims and low
motives, and their externalization, which have marked the unfolding of
the human mind, and which the world preserves in its annals as
historical fact.The child seemed to divine the great truth that
history is but the record of human conduct, conduct manifesting the
mortal mind of man, a mind utterly opposed to the mind that is God,
and therefore unreal, supposititious, and bearing the "minus" sign.Carmen would have none of it that did not reflect good.She refused
utterly to turn her mental gaze toward recorded evil."Padre," she once protested, "when I want to see the sun rise, I don't
look toward the west.And if you want to see the good come up, why do
you look at these stories of bad men and their bad thoughts?"Jose admitted that they were records of the mortal mind--and the mind
that is mortal is _no_ mind."I am learning," he frequently said to himself, after Carmen had left
at the close of their day's work."But my real education did not
commence until I began to see, even though faintly, that the Creator
is mind and infinite good, and that there is nothing real to the
belief in evil; that the five physical senses give us _no_ testimony
of any nature whatsoever; and that real man never could, never did,
fall."Thus the days glided swiftly past, and Jose completed his first year
amid the drowsy influences of this little town, slumbering peacefully
in its sequestered nook at the feet of the green _Cordilleras_.No
further event ruffled its archaic civilization; and only with rare
frequency did fugitive bits of news steal in from the outer world,
which, to the untraveled thought of this primitive folk, remained
always a realm vague and mysterious.Quietly the people followed the
routine of their colorless existence.Each morn broke softly over the
limpid lake; each evening left the blush of its roseate sunset on the
glassy waters; each night wound its velvety arms gently about the
nodding town, while the stars beamed like jewels through the clear,
soft atmosphere above, or the yellow moonbeams stole noiselessly down
the old, sunken trail to dream on the lake's invisible waves.Each month, with unvarying regularity, Rosendo came and went.At times
Jose thought he detected traces of weariness, insidious and
persistently lurking, in the old man's demeanor.At times his limbs
trembled, and his step seemed heavy.Once Jose had found him, seated
back of his cottage, rubbing the knotted muscles of his legs, and
groaning aloud.But when he became aware of Jose presence, the groans
ceased, and the old man sprang to his feet with a look of such grim
determination written across his face that the priest smothered his
apprehensions and forbore to speak.Rosendo was immolating himself
upon his love for the child.Jose knew it; but he would not, if he
could, prevent the sacrifice.Each month their contributions were sent to Cartagena; and as
regularly came a message from Wenceslas, admonishing them to greater
efforts.With the money that was sent to the Bishop went also a
smaller packet to the two women who were caring for the unfortunate
Maria's little babe.The sources of Jose's remittances to Cartagena
were never questioned by Wenceslas.But Simiti slowly awakened to the
mysterious monthly trips of Rosendo; and Don Mario's suspicion became
conviction.He bribed men to follow Rosendo secretly.They came back,
footsore and angry.Rosendo had thrown them completely off the scent.Then Don Mario outfitted and sent his paid emissary after the old man.He wasted two full months in vain search along the Guamoco trail.But
the fever came upon him, and he refused to continue the hunt.The
Alcalde counted the cost, then loudly cursed himself and Rosendo for
the many good _pesos_ so ruthlessly squandered.Then he began to ply
Jose and Rosendo with skillfully framed questions.He worried the
citizens of the village with his suggestions.Finally he bethought
himself to apprise the Bishop of his suspicions.But second
consideration disclosed that plan as likely to yield him nothing but
loss.He knew Rosendo was getting gold from some source.But, too, he
was driving a good trade with the old man on supplies.He settled back
upon his fat haunches at last, determined to keep his own counsel and
let well-enough alone for the present, while he awaited events.Rosendo's vivid interest in Carmen's progress was almost pathetic.When in Simiti he hung over the child in rapt absorption as she worked
out her problems, or recited her lessons to Jose.Often he shook his
head in witness of his utter lack of comprehension.But Carmen
understood, and that sufficed.His admiration for the priest's
learning was deep and reverential.He was a silent worshiper, this
great-hearted man, at the shrine of intellect; but, alas!he himself
knew only the rudiments, which he had acquired by years of patient,
struggling effort, through long days and nights filled with toil.His
particular passion was his Castilian mother-tongue; and the precision
with which he at times used it, his careful selection of words, and
his wide vocabulary, occasioned Jose no little astonishment.One day,
after returning from the hills, he approached Jose as the latter was
hearing Carmen's lessons, and, with considerable embarrassment,
offered him a bit of paper on which were written in his ample hand
several verses.Jose read them, and then looked up wonderingly at the
old man."Why, Rosendo, these are beautiful!"I--they are mine, Padre," replied Rosendo, his face glowing with
pleasure.Nights, up in Guamoco, when I had finished my work, and
when I was so lonely, I would sometimes light my candle and try to
write out the thoughts that came to me."He turned his head, that Rosendo
might not see them.Of the three little poems, two were indited to the
Virgin Mary, and one to Carmen.He lingered over one of the verses of
the latter, for it awoke responsive echoes in his own soul:

       "Without you, the world--a desert of sadness;
           But with you, sweet child--a vale of delight;
       You laugh, like the sunbeam--my gloom becomes gladness;
           You sing--from my heart flee the shadows of night.""I--I have written a good deal of poetry during my life, Padre.I will
show you some of it, if you wish," Rosendo advanced, encouraged by
Jose's approbation."And to think,
without instruction, without training!"Yes, Padre, when I think of the blessed Virgin or the little Carmen,
my thoughts seem to come in poetry."He stooped over the girl and
kissed her.The child reached up and clasped her arms about his black
neck."Padre Rosendo," she said sweetly, "you are a poem, a big one, a
beautiful one.""Aye," seconded Jose, and there was a hitch in his voice, "you are an
epic--and the world is the poorer that it cannot read you!"But, though showing such laudable curiosity regarding the elements
which entered into their simple life in Simiti, Rosendo seldom spoke
of matters pertaining to religion.Yet Jose knew that the old faith
held him, and that he would never, on this plane of existence, break
away from it.He clung to his _escapulario_; he prostrated himself
before the statue of the Virgin; he invoked the aid of Virgin and
Saints when in distress; and, unlike most of the male inhabitants of
the town, he scrupulously prayed his rosary every night, whether at
home, or on the lonely margins of the Tigui.He had once said to Jose
that he was glad Padre Diego had baptised the little Carmen--he felt
safer to have it so.And yet he would not have her brought up in the
Holy Catholic faith.Let her choose or formulate her own religious
beliefs, they should not be influenced by him or others."You can never make me believe, Padre," he would sometimes say to the
priest, "that the little Carmen was not left by the angels on the
river bank.""You have Escolastico's
account, and the boat captain's."Even the blessed Saviour was born of a woman;
and yet he came from heaven.The angels brought him, guarded him as he
lay in the manger, protected him all his life, and then took him back
to heaven again.And I tell you, Padre, the angels brought Carmen, and
they are always with her!"Jose ceased to dispute the old man's contentions.For, had he been
pressed, he would have been forced to admit that there was in the
child's pure presence a haunting spell of mystery--perhaps the mystery
of godliness--but yet an undefinable _something_ that always made him
approach her with a feeling akin to awe.And in the calm, untroubled seclusion of Simiti, in its mediaeval
atmosphere of romance, and amid its ceaseless dreams of a stirring
past, the child unfolded a nature that bore the stamp of divinity, a
nature that communed incessantly with her God, and that read His name
in every trivial incident, in every stone and flower, in the sunbeams,
the stars, and the whispering breeze.In that ancient town, crumbling
into the final stages of decrepitude, she dwelt in heaven.To her, the
rude adobe huts were marble castles; the shabby rawhide chairs and
hard wooden beds were softest down; the coarse food was richer than a
king's spiced viands; and over it all she cast a mantle of love that
was rich enough, great enough, to transform with the grace of fresh
and heavenly beauty the ruins and squalor of her earthly environment."Can a child like Carmen live a sinless life, and still be human?"Jose often mused, as he watched her flitting through the sunlit hours.Ah, yes; but he was born of a virgin,
spotless herself.Jose
often wondered, wondered deeply, as he gazed at her absorbed in her
tasks.Might he not, in the absence of
definite knowledge, accept Rosendo's belief--accept it because of its
beautiful, haunting mystery--that she, too, was miraculously born of a
virgin, and "left by the angels on the river bank"?For, as far as he
might judge, her life was sinless.It was true, she did at rare
intervals display little outbursts of childish temper; she sometimes
forgot and spoke sharply to her few playmates, and even to Dona Maria;
and he had seen her cry for sheer vexation.And yet, these were but
tiny shadows that were cast at rarest intervals, melting quickly when
they came into the glorious sunlight of her radiant nature.But the mystery shrouding the child's parentage, however he might regard
it, often roused within his mind thoughts dark and apprehensive.Only one communication had come from Padre Diego, and that some four
months after his precipitous flight.He had gained the Guamoco trail,
it said, and finally arrived at Remedios.He purposed returning to
Banco ultimately; and, until then, must leave the little Carmen in the
care of those in whom he had immovable confidence, and to whom he
would some day try, however feebly, to repay in an appropriate manner
his infinite debt of gratitude."_Caramba!_" muttered Rosendo, on reading the note."Does the villain
think we are fools?"But none the less could the old man quiet the fear that haunted him,
nor still the apprehension that some day Diego would make capital of
his claim.What that claim might accomplish if laid before Wenceslas,
he shuddered to think.And so he kept the girl at his side when in
Simiti, and bound Jose and the faithful Juan to redoubled vigilance
when he was again obliged to return to the mountains.The care-free children of this tropic realm drowsed
through the long, hot days and gossiped and danced in the soft airs of
night.Rosendo held his unremitting, lonely vigil of toil in the
ghastly solitudes of Guamoco.Jose, exiled and outcast, clung
desperately to the child's hand, and strove to rise into the spiritual
consciousness in which she dwelt.And thus the year fell softly into
the yawning arms of the past and became a memory.Then one day Simiti awoke from its lethargy in terror, with the
spectre of pestilence stalking through her narrow streets.CHAPTER 19


Feliz Gomez, who had been sent to Bodega Central for merchandise which
Don Mario was awaiting from the coast, had collapsed as he stepped
from his boat on his return to Simiti.When he regained consciousness
he called wildly for the priest.he cried, when Jose arrived, "it is _la plaga_!Ah,
_Santisima Virgen_--I am dying!--dying!"He writhed in agony on the
ground.The priest bent over him, his heart throbbing with apprehension."Padre--" The lad strove to raise his head."The innkeeper at Bodega
Central--he told me I might sleep in an empty house back of the
inn._Dios mio!_ There was an old cot there--I slept on it two
nights--_Caramba!_ Padre, they told me then--Ah, _Bendita Virgen_!_Carisima Virgen_, don't let me die!_Ah,
Dios--!_"

His body twisted in convulsions.Jose lifted him and dragged him to
the nearby shed where the lad had been living alone.A terror-stricken
concourse gathered quickly about the doorway and peered in wide-eyed
horror through the narrow window."Feliz, what did they tell you?"cried Jose, laying the sufferer upon
the bed and chafing his cold hands."They told me--a Turk, bound for Zaragoza on the Nechi river--had
taken the wrong boat--in Maganguey.He had been sick--terribly sick
there._Ah, Dios!_ It is coming again, Padre--the pain!_Caramba!_
_Dios mio!_ Save me, Padre, save me!"cried Jose, turning to the stunned
people."Bring cloths--hot water--and send for Don Mario.Dona Lucia,
prepare an _olla_ of your herb tea at once!""Padre"--the boy had become quieter--"when the Turk learned that he
was on the wrong boat--he asked to be put off at the next town--which
was Bodega Central.The innkeeper put him in the empty house--and
he--_Dios_!he died--on that bed where I slept!""Padre, he died--the day before I arrived there--and--ah_, Santisima
Virgen_!they said--he died--of--of--_la colera_!"At the mention of the
disease a loud murmur arose from the people, and they fell back from
the shed."Padre!--_ah, Dios_, how I suffer!Give me the sacrament--I cannot
live--!Ah, Padre, shall I go--to heaven?He stood with eyes riveted in horror upon the
tormented lad."Padre"--the boy's voice grew weaker--"I fell sick that day--I started
for Simiti--I died a thousand times in the _cano_--_ah, caramba_!But,
Padre--promise to get me out of purgatory--I have no money for Masses._Caramba!_ I cannot stand it!Padre--quick--I have not
been very wicked--but I stole--_Dios_, how I suffer!--I stole two
pesos from the innkeeper at Bodega Central--he thought he lost
them--but I took them out of the drawer--Padre, pay him for me--then I
will not go to hell!_Dios!_"

Rosendo at that moment entered the house.cried Jose, turning upon him in wild apprehension."Keep away, for God's sake, keep away!"In sullen silence Rosendo disregarded the priest's frenzied appeal.His eyes widened when he saw the boy torn with convulsions, but he did
not flinch.Only when he saw Carmen approaching, attracted by the
great crowd, he hastily bade one of the women turn her back home.Hour after hour the poor sufferer tossed and writhed.Again and again
he lapsed into unconsciousness, from which he would emerge to
piteously beg the priest to save him."_ he pleaded,
extending his trembling arms to Jose, "can you do nothing?_Santisima Virgen_, how I suffer!"Then, when the evening shadows were gathering, the final convulsions
seized him and wrenched his poor soul loose.Jose and Rosendo were
alone with him when the end came.The people had early fled from the
stricken lad, and were gathering in little groups before their homes
and on the corners, discussing in low, strained tones the advent of
the scourge.Those who had been close to the sick boy were now cold
with fear.Women wept, and children clung whimpering to their skirts.The men talked excitedly in hoarse whispers, or lapsed into a state of
terrified dullness.Jose went from the death-bed to the Alcalde.Don Mario saw him coming,
and fled into the house, securing the door after him."For the love of the Virgin
do not come here!_Caramba!_"

"But, Don Mario, the lad is dead!"Come, you are the
Alcalde.Let us talk about--"

"_Caramba!_ Do what you want to!_Nombre de Dios!_ If
I live through the night I shall go to the mountains to-morrow!""But we must have a coffin to bury the lad!shrilled Don Mario, jumping up and
down in his excitement."Bury him in a blanket--anything--but keep
away from my house!"Jose turned sadly away and passed through the deserted streets back to
the lonely shed."_Bien, Padre_," he said
quietly, "we are exiled."I might carry the disease to the
senora and the little Carmen.And," he added, "you
too, Padre."he exclaimed, pointing
toward the bed."When it is dark, Padre," replied Rosendo, "we will take him out
through the back door and bury him beyond the shales._Hombre!_ I must
see now if I can find a shovel."Jose sank down upon the threshold, a prey to corroding despair, while
Rosendo went out in search of the implement.The streets were dead,
and few lights shone from the latticed windows.The pall of fear had
settled thick upon the stricken town.Those who were standing before
their houses as Rosendo approached hastily turned in and closed their
doors.Jose, in the presence of death in a terrible form, sat mute."No shovel, Padre," he announced."But I crept up back of my house and
got this bar which I had left standing there when I came back from the
mountains.I can scrape up the loose earth with my hands.He was but a tool in the hands of a man to whom
physical danger was but a matter of temperament.He absently helped
Rosendo wrap the black, distorted corpse in the frayed blanket; and
then together they passed out into the night with their grewsome
burden."Why not to the cemetery, Rosendo?"asked Jose, as the old man took an
opposite course."The cemetery is on shale, and I could
not dig through it in time.We must get the body under ground at once._Caramba!_ If we put it in one of the _bovedas_ in the cemetery the
buzzards will eat it and scatter the plague all over the town.The
_bovedas_ are broken, and have no longer any doors, you remember."So beyond the shales they went, stumbling through the darkness, their
minds freighted with a burden of apprehension more terrible than the
thing they bore in their arms.The shales crossed, Rosendo left the
trail, cutting a way through the bush with his _machete_ a distance of
several hundred feet.Then, by the weird yellow light of a single
candle, he opened the moist earth and laid the hideous, twisted thing
within."And now, Padre," said Rosendo, at length breaking the awful silence,
"where will you sleep to-night?I cannot let you go back to your
house.It is too near the senora and Carmen.No man in town will let
you stay in his house, since you have handled the plague.Will you
sleep in the shed where the lad died?I
called to the senora when I went after the bar, and she will lay two
blankets out in the _plaza_ for us.And in the morning she will put
food where we can get it.His mind had congealed with the horror of the
situation."Come, Padre," he said gently."The hill up back of the second church is high, and no one lives near.I will get the blankets and we will pass the night out there."Is it--_la
colera_?""_Quien sabe?_ Padre," returned Rosendo."There has been plague
here--these people, some of them, still remember it--but it was long
ago.There have been cases along the river--and brought, I doubt not,
by Turks, like this one.""And do you think that it is now all along the river?That Bodega
Central is being ravaged by the scourge?"_Quien sabe?_ Padre.All I do know is that the people of Simiti are
terribly frightened, and the pestilence may wipe away the town before
it leaves.""Nothing, Padre--but stay and meet it," the man replied quietly.Then Rosendo wrapped himself in one
of the blankets which he had picked up as he passed through the
_plaza_, and lay down upon the shale.The warm, sluggish air lay about him,
mephitic in its touch.The great vampire bats that soughed through it
symbolized the "pestilence that walketh in darkness."Lonely calls
drifted across the warm lake waters from the dripping jungle like the
hollow echoes of lost souls.Rosendo tossed fitfully, and now and then
uttered deep groans.He
struggled to his feet and paced gloomily back and forth along the brow
of the hill.The second church stood near, deserted, gloomy, no longer
a temple of God, but a charnel house of fear and black superstition.In the distance the ghostly white walls of the Rincon church glowed
faintly in the feeble light that dripped from the yellow stars.There
was now no thought of God--no thought of divine aid.Jose was riding
again the mountainous billows of fear and unbelief; nor did he look
for the Master to come to him through the thick night across the
heaving waters.The tardy dawn brought Dona Maria to the foot of the hill, where she
deposited food, and held distant converse with the exiles.Don Mario
had just departed, taking the direction across the lake toward San
Lucas.He had compelled his wife to remain in Simiti to watch over the
little store, while he fled with two boatmen and abundant supplies.Others likewise were preparing to flee, some to the Boque river, some
up the Guamoco trail.Dona Maria was keeping Carmen closely, nor would
she permit her to as much as venture from the house."Why should not the senora take Carmen and go to Boque, Rosendo?""Then you and I could occupy our own houses until we knew
what the future had in store for us."Carmen would be safe in the protecting care of
Don Nicolas.From the
hilltop Jose could descry the Alcalde's boat slowly wending its way
across the lake toward the Juncal.Rosendo, having finished his
morning meal, prepared to meet the day."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "when the sun gets high we cannot stay here."Why not in the old church, Rosendo?""_Hombre!_ that old church is
haunted!"Jose could never understand the nature of this man, so brave in the
face of physical danger, yet so permeated with superstitious dread of
those imaginary inhabitants of the invisible realm."Padre," suggested Rosendo at length."We will go down there, nearer
the lake, to the old shack where the blacksmith had his forge.He died
two years ago, and the place has since been empty.""Go then, Rosendo, and I will follow later," assented Jose, who now
craved solitude for the struggle for self-mastery which he saw
impending.While Rosendo moved off toward the deserted shack, the priest
continued his restless pacing along the crest of the hill.The morning
was glorious--but for the blighting thoughts of men.The vivid green
of the dewy hills shone like new-laid color.The lake lay like a
diamond set in emeralds.The dead town glowed brilliantly white in the
mounting sun.Jose knew that the heat would soon drive him from the
hill.He walked toward it;
then mounted the broken steps.The hinges, rusted and broken, had let
the heavy door, now bored through and through by _comejen_ ants, slip
to one side.Through the opening thus afforded, Jose could peer into
the cavernous blackness within.The sun shot its terrific heat at him,
and the stone steps burned his sandaled feet.Then through the opening he entered the dusty,
ill-smelling old edifice.When his eyes had become accustomed to the dimness within, he saw that
the interior was like that of the other church, only in a more
dilapidated state.There were but few benches; and the brick altar,
poorer in construction, had crumbled away at one side.Dust, mold, and
cobwebs covered everything; but the air was gratefully cool.Jose
brushed the thick dust from one of the benches.Then he lay down upon
it, and was soon sunk in heavy sleep.*       *       *       *       *

The sun had just crossed the meridian.Jose awoke, conscious that he
was not alone.The weird legend that hung about the old church
filtered slowly through his dazed brain.Rosendo had said that an
angel of some kind dwelt in the place.And surely a presence sat on
the bench in the twilight before him!He roused up, rubbed his sleepy
eyes, and peered at it."I looked all around for the bad angel that padre Rosendo said lived
here, and I didn't find anything but you.""Why, Padre--what is it?First, madre
Maria tells me I must go to Boque with her.And now you will not let
me come near you.And I love you so--" Tears choked her voice, and she
sat looking in mute appeal at the priest.He passed his hand dully
across his brow as if to brush the mist from his befogged brain."Padre dear,
when madre Maria told me I had to go to Boque, I went to your house to
ask you, and--and you weren't there.And I couldn't find padre Rosendo
either--and there wasn't anybody in the streets at all--and I came up
here.Then I saw the blanket out on the hill, and I kept hunting for
you--I wanted to see you _so_ much.And when I saw the door of the
church broken, I thought you might be in here--and so I came in--and,
oh, Padre dear, I was _so_ glad to find you--but I wouldn't wake you
up--and while you were sleeping I just _knew_ that God was taking care
of you all the time--"

Jose had sunk again upon the bench.Carmen came flying to him across the darkness and threw
her arms about his neck.I just couldn't stand it to
leave you!"The flood-gates opened wide, and the girl sobbed upon his
shoulder.But his own tears were mingling freely with hers.The
strain of the preceding night had left him weak.He strove feebly to
loosen the tightly clasped arms of the weeping girl.Then he buried
his drawn face in her thick curls and strained her to his heaving
breast.What this might mean to Carmen he knew full well.If she preceded him into the dark vale, it would be for
only a little while.The sobs died away, and the girl looked up at the suffering man."Padre dear, you will not send me away--will you?"Then she drew herself closer to
him and whispered softly, "Padre dear--I love you."he cried, "have you the heart
to let evil attack such a one as this!""Why, Padre dear--what is it?Did--er--did your madre Maria say why you
must go to Boque?""She said Feliz Gomez died last night of the plague, and that the
people were afraid they would all get sick and die too.And she
said--Padre dear, she said you were afraid I would get sick, and so
you told her to take me away.She
didn't understand you, did she?You can't
be, you know, can you?We
_know_--don't we, Padre dear?""Why--why, we know that God is _everywhere_!"She looked at him
wonderingly.What could she understand of a nature so wavering?--firm
when the sun shone bright above--tottering when the blasts of
adversity whirled about it?He had said such beautiful things to her,
such wonderful things about God and His children only yesterday.Why again this sudden lowering of
standards?he
muttered grimly, forgetful of the child's presence.she pleaded, passing her little hand tenderly over
his cheek."You are just trying to think that two and two are
seven--and you can't prove it--and so you'd better stop trying!"She
broke into a little forced laugh.Her voice was full of plaintive tenderness."You have
talked so much about that good man Jesus.What would he say if he saw
you trying to make two and two equal seven?And if he had been here
last night--would he have let Feliz die?"None was required when Carmen put her
questions."Why didn't _you_ cure Feliz?""You have told me, often, that Jesus cured sick people.And you said
he even made the dead ones live again--didn't you, Padre dear?""Yes," he murmured; "they say he did.""And you read to me once from your Bible where he told the people that
he gave them power over everything.And you said he was the great
rule--you called him the Christ-principle--and you said he never went
away from us.Well, Padre dear," she concluded with quick emphasis,
"why don't you use him now?"Then, when no reply came--

"Feliz didn't die, Padre.""_Hombre!_ It's all the same--he's gone!"he cried in a tone of sullen
bitterness."You think he is gone, Padre dear.And
so now you both see it that way--that's all.If you would see things
the way that good man Jesus told you to--well, wouldn't they be
different--wouldn't they, Padre dear?""No doubt they would, child, no doubt.But--"

She waited a moment for him to express the limitation which the
conjunctive implied.Then:

"Padre dear, how do you think he did it?How did he cure sick people,
and make the dead ones live again?""I--I don't know, child--I am not sure.That knowledge has been lost,
long since.""You _do_ know, Padre," she insisted; "you _do_!"He classed it with all evil under the one heading--a lie--a lie about
God.""But when a person tells a lie, he doesn't speak the truth, does he?""And a lie has no rule, no principle?""And so it isn't anything--doesn't come from anything true--hasn't any
real life, has it?""No, a lie is utterly unreal, not founded on anything but supposition,
either ignorant or malicious.""Then Jesus said sickness was a supposition, didn't he?""And God, who made everything real, didn't make suppositions."Well, Padre dear, if you _know_ all that, why don't you act as if you
did?"That which is real--life, not
death--immortality, not oblivion--love, not hate--good, not evil!"_Chiquita_--" His voice was thick."You--you believe all that, don't
you?""No, Padre dear"--she smiled up at him through the darkness--"I don't
believe it, I _know_ it.""But--how--how do you know it?"The trouble is, you believe it, but I don't think you ever try to
_prove_ it.If you believed my problems in algebra could be solved,
but never tried to prove it--well, you wouldn't do very much in
algebra, would you?"Jose's straining eyes were peering straight ahead.Through the thick
gloom he saw the mutilated figure of the Christ hanging on its cross
beside the crumbling altar.It reflected the broken image of the
Christ-principle in the hearts of men.And was he not again crucifying
the gentle Christ?Did not the world daily crucify him and nail him
with their false beliefs to the cross of carnal error which they set
up in the Golgotha of their own souls?And were they not daily paying
the awful penalty therefor?Aye, paying it in agony, in torturing
agony of soul and body, in blasted hopes, crumbling ambitions, and
inevitable death!"Padre dear, what did the good man say sickness came from?"Carmen's
soft voice brought him back from his reflections."Wrong conduct, based on wrong thinking.And wrong thinking is based
on wrong beliefs, false thought.""But to believe that there is anything but God, and the things He
made, is sin, isn't it, Padre dear?""Sin is--yes, to believe in other powers than God is to break the very
first Commandment--and that is the chief of sins!""Well, Padre dear, can't you make yourself think right?Do you know
what you really think about God, anyway?"Jose rose and paced up and down through the dark aisle."I try to think," he answered, "that He is mind; that He is infinite,
everywhere; that He is all-powerful; that He knows all things; and
that He is perfect and good.I try not to think that He made evil, or
anything that is or could be bad, or that could become sick, or decay,
or die.Whatever He made must be real, and real things last forever,
are immortal, eternal.I strive to think He did make man in His image
and likeness--and that man has never been anything else--that man
never 'fell.'""Only an old, outworn theological belief.But, to resume: I believe
that, since God is mind, man must be an idea of His.Since God is
infinite, man must exist in Him.I know that any number of lies can be
made up about true things.And any number of falsities can be assumed
about God and what He has made.I am sure that the material universe
and man are a part of the lie about God and the way He manifests and
expresses Himself in and through His ideas.The mental realm includes all truth, all fact.But there may be all sorts of supposition about this fact.And yet,
while fact is based upon absolute and undeviating principle--and I
believe that principle to be God--supposition is utterly without any
rule or principle whatsoever.It is wholly subject to truth, to
Principle, to God.Hence, bad or wrong thought is absolutely subject
to good or real thought, and must go down before it.The mortal man is
a product of wrong thought.He is a supposition; and so is the
universe of matter in which he is supposed to live.We have already
learned that the things he thinks he hears, feels, tastes, smells, and
sees are only his own thoughts.And these turn out to be suppositions.I--I don't think
I understand all you say.But, anyway, I guess it is right."he exclaimed, forgetting that he was talking
to a child."Evil, which includes sickness and death, is only a false
idea of good.It is a misinterpretation, made in the thought-activity
which constitutes what we call the human consciousness.And that is
the opposite--the suppositional opposite--of the mind that is God.Evil, then, becomes a supposition and a lie."But, Padre--I don't see why you don't act as if you really believed
all that!"It has not yet been eradicated from my thought," he
answered slowly."But, Padre, what will drive it out?""Love, child--love only, for 'perfect love casteth out fear.'""Oh, then, Padre dear, I will just love it all out of you, every bit!"she exclaimed, clasping her arms about him again and burying her face
in his shoulder."Ah, little one," he said sadly, "I must love more.I must love my
fellow-men and good more than myself and evil.If I didn't love myself
so much, I would have no fear.If I loved God as you do, dearest
child, I would never come under fear's heavy shadow.""You _do_ love everybody--you have got to, for you are God's child.And now," she added, getting down and drawing him toward the door,
"let us go out of this smelly old church.We've got to have our lessons, you know.""But--child, the people will not let me come near them--nor you
either, now," he said, holding back."They think we may give them the
disease."She looked up at him with a tender, wistful smile."Padre dear, I love you," she said, "but you make me lots of
trouble.But--we are going to love all the fear away, and--" stamping
her little bare foot--"we are going to get the right answer to your
problem, too!"The priest took her hand, and together they passed out into the
dazzling sunlight.On the brow of the hill stood Rosendo, talking excitedly, and with
much vehement gesticulation, to Dona Maria, who remained a safe
distance from him.The latter and her good consort exclaimed in horror
when they saw Carmen with the priest."_ cried Rosendo, darting toward them."I could kill you for
this, Padre!_Hombre!_ How came the child here, and with you?_Dios
mio!_ Have you no heart, but that, when you know you may die, you
would take her with you?"He swung his long arms menacingly before the
priest, and his face worked with passion.she cried, seizing
one of his hands in both of her own.And he isn't going to die--nor I,
either!"Dona Maria approached and quietly joined the little group."_ cried the distressed Rosendo, turning upon her.Dios y diablo!_ will you all die?"He stamped the ground and
tore his hair in his impotent protest."_Na_, Rosendo," said the woman placidly, "if you are in danger, I
will be too.If you must die, so will I. I will not be left alone.""_Bien_," he said, "we have all been exposed to the plague now, and we
will stand together.Rosendo's anger soon evaporated, but his face retained traces of deep
anxiety."Maria tells me, Padre," he said, "that Amado Sanchez fell
sick last night with the flux, and nobody will stay with him,
excepting his woman.""Let us go to him, then," replied the priest."Dona Maria, do you and
Carmen return to your house, whilst Rosendo and I seek to be of
service to those who may need us."Together they started down the main street of the town.Many of the inhabitants had fled to the hills.But
there were still many whose circumstances would not permit of flight.As they neared Rosendo's house the little party were hailed from a
distance by Juan Mendoza and Pedro Cardenas, neighbors living on
either side of Rosendo and the priest."_Hola_, Padre and Don Rosendo!"they called; "you cannot return to
your homes, for you would expose us to the plague!We will burn the houses over your heads if you return!""But, _amigos_--" Jose began."_Na_, Padre," they cried in tense excitement, "it is for the best!We will supply you with food and blankets--but you
must not come here!Amado Sanchez is sick; Guillermo Hernandez is
sick.The attitude of the
frightened, desperate men was threatening.Jose saw that it would be
unwise to resist them."_Bien, compadres_, we will go," he said, his heart breaking with
sorrow for these children of fear.Then, assembling his little family,
he turned and retraced his steps sadly through the street that burned
in lonely silence in the torrid heat.Carmen's eyes were big with wonder; but a happy idea soon drove all
apprehension from her thought.she exclaimed, "we will live
in the old church, and we will play house there!"She clapped her
hands in merriment.na!_" he insisted, when they reached
the steps, "do you go in if you wish; but I will stay outside in the
shadow of the building."Nor would the combined entreaties of Carmen
and Jose induce him to yield.Dona Maria calmly and silently prepared
to remain with him."Pull off the old door, Padre!"There goes the bad angel that padre
Rosendo was afraid of!"A number of bats, startled at the noise and
the sudden influx of light, were scurrying out through the open door."Like the legion of demons which Jesus sent into the swine," said
Jose."I will tell you the story some day, _chiquita_," he said, in
answer to her look of inquiry.The day passed quickly for the child, nor did she seem to cast another
thought in the direction of the cloud which hung over the sorrowing
town.At dusk, Mendoza and Cardenas came to the foot of the hill with
food and blankets."Amado Sanchez has just died," they reported."No, Padre, he had been ailing for many days--but it may have been the
plague just the same.Perhaps it was with us before Feliz brought it.But we have not exposed ourselves to the disease and--Padre--there is
not a man in Simiti who will bury Amado."_Bien, amigo_," he replied.To-night Rosendo and I will come and bury him."Jose had sent Carmen and Dona Maria beyond the church, that they might
not hear the grewsome tidings.When the men had returned to their
homes, the little band on the hilltop ate their evening meal in
silence.Then a bench was swept clean for Carmen's bed, for she
insisted on sleeping in the old church with Jose when she learned that
he intended to pass the night there.Again, as the heavy shadows were gathering, Jose and Rosendo descended
into the town and bore out the body of Amado Sanchez to a resting
place beside the poor lad who had died the day before.To a man of
such delicate sensibilities as Jose, whose nerves were raw from
continual friction with a world with which he was ever at variance,
this task was one of almost unendurable horror.He returned to the old
church in a state bordering on collapse."Rosendo," he murmured, as they seated themselves on the hillside in
the still night, "I think we shall all die of the plague.I am tired, utterly tired of striving to live against such
odds."Courage, _compadre_!"urged Rosendo, putting his great arm about the
priest's shoulders."We must all go some time, and perhaps now; but
while we live let us live like men!""No--what is it that the old history of mine says?'Death is not
departing, but arriving.'But the little Carmen--I
wish that she might live.She--ah, Padre, she could do much good in
the world._Bien_, we are all in the hands of the One who brought us
here--and He will take us in the way and at the time that He
appoints--is it not so, Padre?"No, he could not say that it was
so.The thoughts which he had expressed to Carmen that morning still
flitted through his mind.The child was right--Rosendo's philosophy
was that of resignation born of ignorance.And he did not really think that Carmen would be smitten of the
plague.Something seemed to tell him that it was impossible.But, on
the other hand, he would himself observe every precaution in regard to
her.No, he would not sleep in the church that night.He had handled
the body of the plague's second victim, and he could not rest near the
child.Perhaps exposure to the night air and the heavy dews would
serve to cleanse him.And so he wrapped himself in the blanket which
Dona Maria brought from within the church, and lay down beside the
faithful pair.In the long hours of that lonely night Jose lay beneath the shimmering
stars pondering, wondering.Down below in the smitten town the poor
children of his flock were eating their hearts out in anxious dread
and bitter sorrow.Was it through any fault of theirs that this thing
had come upon them, like a bolt from a cloudless sky?No--except that
they were human, mortal.And if the thing were real, it came from the
mind that is God; if unreal--but it seemed real to these simple folk,
terribly so!His heart yearned toward them as his thought penetrated the still
reaches of the night and hovered about their lonely vigil.What balm could he extend to those wearing out weary
hours on beds of agony below?True religion, if they could
but understand it; but not again the empty husks of the faith that had
been taught them in the name of Christ!Where did scholastic theology
stand in such an hour as this?Did it offer easement from their
torture of mind and body?Strength to bear in patience their heavy
burden?Not of this life--nay, naught but the thread-worn,
undemonstrable promise of a life to come, if, indeed, they might
happily avoid the pangs of purgatory and the horrors of the quenchless
flames of hell!God, what had not the Church to answer for!And yet, these ignorant children were but succumbing to the
evidence of their material senses--though small good it would do to
tell them so!Could they but know--as did Carmen--that rejection of
error and reception of truth meant life--ah, could they but know!Could he himself but know--really _know_--that God is neither the
producer of evil, nor the powerless witness of its ravages--could
he but understand and prove that evil is not a self-existing
entity, warring eternally with God, what might he not accomplish!For Jesus had said: "These signs"--the cure of disease, the rout of
death--"shall follow them that believe," that understand, that
know.Why could he not go down to those beds of torture and say
with the Christ: "Arise, for God hath made thee whole"?He knew
why--"without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that
cometh of God must believe"--must _know_--"that He is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him."The suffering victims in the town
below were asleep in a state of religious dullness.The task of
independent thinking was onerous to such as they.Gladly did they
leave it to the Church to do their thinking for them.And thus did
they suffer for the trust betrayed!But truth is omnipotent, and "one with God is a majority."Jesus gave
few rules, but none more fundamental than that "with God all things
are possible."If so, he might arise
and go down into the stricken town and bid its frightened children be
whole.If he fully recognized "the Father" as all-powerful,
all-good, and if he could clearly see and retain his grasp on the
truth that evil, the supposititious opposite of good, had neither
place nor power, except in the minds of mortals receptive to it--ah,
then--then----

A soft patter of little feet on the shales broke in upon his thought.He turned and beheld Carmen coming through the night."Padre dear," she whispered, "why didn't you come and sleep in the
church with me?"He had not the heart nor the
courage to send her away.He put out his arm and drew her to him."Padre dear," the child murmured, "it is nice out here under the
stars--and I want to be with you--I love you--love you--" The whisper
died away, and the child slept on his arm.CHAPTER 20


Dawn brought Juan Mendoza and Pedro Cardenas again to the hill, and
with them came others."Mateo Gil, Pablo Polo, and Juanita Gomez are
sick, Padre," announced Mendoza, the spokesman."They ask for the last
sacrament.You could come down and give it to them, and then return to
the hill, is it not so?""Yes," assented Jose, "I will come.""And, Padre," continued Mendoza, "we talked it over last night, after
Amado Sanchez died, and we think it would help if you said a Mass for
us in the church to-day.""I will do so this afternoon, after I have visited the sick," he
replied pityingly.Then--

"We think, too, Padre, that if we held a procession--in honor of Santa
Barbara--perhaps she would pray for us, and might stop the sickness.We could march through the town this evening, while you stood here and
prayed as we passed around the hill.But the anxious faces
directed toward him melted his heart."Yes, children," he replied gently, "do as you wish.Keep your houses
this afternoon while I visit the sick and offer the Mass.I will leave
the _hostia_ on the altar.Carry it
with you in your rogation to Santa Barbara this evening, and I will
stand here and pray for you."The people departed, sorrowing, but grateful.Hope revived in the
breasts of some.But most of them awaited in trembling the icy touch
of the plague."Padre," said Rosendo, when the people had gone."I have been thinking
about the sickness, and I remember what my father told me he learned
from a Jesuit missionary.It was that the fat from a human body would
cure rheumatism.And then the missionary laughed and said that the fat
from a plump woman would cure all diseases of mind and body.If that
is so, Padre, and Juanita Gomez dies--she is very plump, Padre--could
we not take some of the fat from her body and rub it on the sick--"

"God above, Rosendo!cried Jose recoiling in
horror."Would you not try everything
that might possibly save these people?"No, my faithful ally," replied Jose."You did not get the sense in
which he said it.Neither human fat nor medicine of any kind will help
these people.Nothing will be accomplished for them until their fear
has been removed.For, I--well, the symptoms manifested by poor Feliz
may have been those of Asiatic cholera.And as
for Sanchez--_Bien_, we do not know--not for certain."He stopped and
pondered the question."Padre," pursued Rosendo, "I have used the liver of a lizard for
toothache, and it was very good.""I have no doubt of it, Rosendo," replied Jose, with a smile."And in
days past stranger remedies than that were used by supposedly wise
people.When the eyesight was poor, they rubbed wax from the human ear
upon the eyes, and I doubt not marvelous restorations of sight were
made.So also dogs' teeth were ground into powder and taken to
alleviate certain bodily pains.Almost everything that could be
swallowed has been taken by mankind to cure their aches and torments.But they still ache to-day; and will continue to do so, I believe,
until their present state of mind greatly changes."When the simple midday meal of corn _arepa_ and black coffee was
finished, Jose descended into the quiet town."It is absurd that we
should be kept on the hill," he had said to Rosendo, "but these dull,
simple minds believe that, having handled those dead of the plague, we
have become agents of infection.They forget that they themselves are
living either in the same house with it, or closely adjacent.But it
humors them, poor children, and we will stay here for their sakes.""_Caramba!_ and they have made us their sextons!"The clammy hand of fear again reached for his heart.He turned to Carmen, who was busily occupied in the shade of the old
church."Your lessons, _chiquita_?"he queried, going to her for a moment's
abstraction."No, Padre dear," she replied, smiling up at him, while she quickly
concealed the bit of paper on which she had been writing."Then what are you doing, little one?""Padre dear--don't--don't always make me tell you everything," she
pleaded, but only half in earnest, as she cast an enigmatical glance
at him."But this time I insist on knowing; so you might as well tell me.""Well then, if you must know," she replied, her face beaming with a
happiness which seemed to Jose strangely out of place in that tense
atmosphere, "I have been writing a question to God."I have done that for a long, long time.When I
want to know what to do, and think I don't see just what is best, I
write my question to God on a piece of paper.Then I read it to Him,
and tell Him I know He knows the answer and that He will tell me.And
then I put the paper under a stone some place, and--well, that's all,
Padre.She beamed at him like a glorious noonday
sun.The priest stood before her in wonder and admiration."And does He
tell you the answers to your questions, _chiquita_?"Not always right away--but He never fails--never!""Will you tell me what you are asking Him now?"His eyes dimmed as he read:

  "Dear, dear Father, please tell your little girl and her dear
  Padre Jose what it is that makes the people think they have to die
  down in the town.""And where will you put the paper, little girl?"he asked, striving to
control his voice."Why, I don't know, Padre.Oh, why not put it under the altar in this
old church?"she exclaimed, pleased with the thought of such a novel
hiding place.assented Jose; and together they entered the building.After much stumbling over rubbish, much soiling of hands and
disturbing of bats and lizards, while Carmen's happy laugh rang
merrily through the gloomy old pile, they laid the paper carefully
away behind the altar in a little pocket, and covered it with an adobe
brick."Now we will wait for the
answer."Jose went down into the ominous silence of the town with a lighter
heart.The sublime faith of the child moved before him like a beacon.To the sick he spoke words of comfort, with the vision of Carmen
always before him.At the altar in the empty church, where he offered
the Mass in fulfillment of his promise to the people, her fair form
glowed with heavenly radiance from the pedestal where before had stood
the dilapidated image of the Virgin.He prepared the sacred wafer and
left a part of it on the altar for the people to carry in their
procession to Santa Barbara.The other portion he took to the sick
ones who had asked for the sacrament.Mateo Gil, he thought, could
not live the night through.He knelt at the loathsome bedside of the
suffering man and prayed long and earnestly for light.He tried not to
ask, but to know.While there, he heard a call from the street,
announcing the passing of Guillermo Hernandez.The plague was upon them in all its cruel virulence.Sadly he returned to the hill, just as the sun tipped the highest
peaks of the _Cordilleras_.Standing on the crest, he waited with
heavy heart, while the mournful little procession wended its sad way
through the streets below.An old, battered wooden image of one of the
Saints, rescued from the oblivion of the _sacristia_, had been dressed
to represent Santa Barbara.This, bedecked with bits of bright 
ribbon, was carried at the head of the procession by the faithful
Juan.Following him, Pedro Gonzales, old and tottering, bore a dinner
plate, on which rested the _hostia_, while over the wafer a tall young
lad held a soiled umbrella, for there was no canopy.A slow chant rose from the lips of the people like a dirge.It struck
the heart of the priest like a chill wind."_ Tears streamed from his eyes while he gazed upon his stricken
people.Slowly, wearily, they wound around the base of the hill, some
sullen with despair, others with eyes turned beseechingly upward to
where the priest of God stood with outstretched hands, his full heart
pouring forth a passionate appeal to Him to turn His light upon these
simple-minded children.When they had gone back down the road, their
bare feet raising a cloud of thick dust which hid them from his view,
Jose sank down upon the rock and buried his face in his hands."I know--I think I know, oh, God," he murmured; "but as yet I have not
proved--not yet.But grant that I may soon--for their sakes.""There is another body to bury to-night,
Padre.*       *       *       *       *

Standing over the new grave, in the solemn hush of night, the priest
murmured: "I am the resurrection and the life."But the mound upon
which Rosendo was stolidly heaping the loose earth marked only another
victory of the mortal law of death over a human sense of life.And
there was no one there to call forth the sleeping man."Behold, I give you power over all things," said the marvelous Jesus.The wondrous, irresistible power which he exerted in behalf of
suffering humanity, he left with the world when he went away."Still here," sighed the sorrowing priest, "still here--lo, always
here--but we know it not.Sunken in materiality, and enslaved to the
false testimony of the physical senses, we lack the spirituality that
alone would enable us to grasp and use that Christ-power, which is the
resurrection and the life.""Padre," said Rosendo, when they turned back toward the hill,
"Hernandez is now with the angels.You gave him the sacrament, did you
not?""_Bien_, then you remitted his sins, and he is doubtless in paradise.But," he mused, "it may be that he had first to pass through
purgatory._Caramba!_ I like not the thought of those hot fires!""Your mental wanderings at
times are puerile!Do not be
deceived, Hernandez is still the same man, even though he has left his
earthly body behind.Do not think he has been lifted at once into
eternal bliss.The Church has taught such rubbish for ages, and has
based its pernicious teachings upon the grossly misunderstood words of
Jesus.The Church is a failure--a dead, dead failure, in every sense
of the word!And that man lying there in his grave is a ghastly proof
of it!"Rosendo looked wonderingly at the excited priest, whose bitter words
rang out so harshly on the still night air."The Church has failed utterly to preserve the simple gospel of the
Christ!It has basely, wantonly betrayed its traditional trust!It has
fought and slain and burned for centuries over trivial, vulnerable
non-essentials, and thrown its greatest pearls to the swine!It no
longer prophesies; it carps and reviles!It no longer heals the sick;
but it conducts a purgatorial lottery at so much a head!It has become
a jumble of idle words, a mumbling of silly formulae, a category of
stupid, insensate ceremonies!Its children are taught to derive their
faith from such legends as that of the holy Saint Francis, who, to
convince a heretic, showed the _hostia_ to an ass, which on beholding
the sacred dough immediately kneeled!"_Ca-ram-ba!_ But you speak hard words, Padre!"muttered Rosendo,
vague speculations flitting through his brain as to the priest's
mental state.continued Jose heatedly, "the Church has fought truth
desperately ever since the Master's day!It has fawned at the feet of
emperor and plutocrat, and licked the bloody hand of the usurer who
tossed her a pittance of his foul gains!In the great world-battles
for reform, for the rights of man, for freedom from the slavery of man
to man or to drink and drugs, she has come up only as the smoke has
cleared away, but always in time to demand the spoils!She has filched
from the systems of philosophy of every land and age, and after
bedaubing them with her own gaudy colors, has foisted them upon
unthinking mankind as divine decrees and mandates!She has foully
insulted God and man!--"

"_Caramba_, Padre!_Hombre_, we must get back to the
hill!You voice the Church's stock complaint of every
man who exposes her shams: 'He hath a devil!'"Jose went on more excitedly:

"You ask if Hernandez is in paradise or purgatory.He is in a state no
better nor worse than our own, for both are wholly mental.We are now
in the fires of as great a purgatory as any man can ever experience!Yes, there is a purgatory--right here on earth--and it follows us
after death, and after every death that we shall die, until we learn
to know God and see Him as infinite good, without taint or trace of
evil!The flames of hell are eternal to us as long as we eat of 'the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil'--as long as we believe in
other powers than God--as long as we believe sin and disease and evil
to be as real and as potent as good!When we know these things as
awful human illusions, and when we recognize God as the infinite mind
that did not create evil, and does not know or behold it, then, and
then only, will the flames of purgatory and hell in this state of
consciousness which we mistakenly call life, and in the states of
consciousness still to come, begin to diminish in intensity, and
finally die out!"Then he turned to Rosendo
and put his hand affectionately upon the old man's shoulder."My good
friend," he said more calmly, "I speak with intense feeling, for I
have suffered much through the intolerance, the unspirituality, and
the worldly ambition of the agents of Holy Church.I suffer, because I
see what she is, and how widely she has missed the mark.But, worse, I
see how blindly, how cruelly, she leads and betrays her trusting
children--and it is the thought of that which at times almost drives
me mad!Do you but look to Carmen for your faith.She knows God, and she will lead you straight to Him.And
as you follow her, your foolish ideas of purgatory, hell, and
paradise, of wafers and virgins--all the tawdry beliefs which the
Church has laid upon you, will drop off, one by one, and melt away as
do the mists on the lake when the sun mounts high."Carmen and Dona Maria sat against the wall of the old church, waiting
for them.The child ran through the darkness and grasped Jose's hand."I wouldn't go to sleep until you came, Padre!""I
wanted to be sure you wouldn't sleep anywhere else than right next to
me.""Padre," admonished Rosendo anxiously, "do you think you ought to let
her come close to you now?The plague--"

Jose turned to him and spoke low."There is no power or influence that
we can exert upon her, Rosendo, either for good or evil.She is
obeying a spiritual law of which we know but little.""Just this, Rosendo: _'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind
is stayed on thee.'_"

The late moon peeped timidly above the drowsing treetops.Its yellow
beams stole silently across the still lake and up the hillside to the
crumbling church.When they reached the four quiet figures, huddled
close against the ghostly wall, they filtered like streams of liquid
gold through the brown curls of the little head lying on the priest's
shoulder.And there they dwelt as symbols of Love's protecting care
over the trusting children of this world, until the full dawn of the
glorious sun of Truth.CHAPTER 21


Jose rose from his hard bed stiff and weary.Depression sat heavily
upon his soul, and he felt miserably unable to meet the day.Dona
Maria was preparing the coffee over a little fire back of the church.The odor of the steaming liquid drifted to him on the warm morning air
and gave him a feeling of nausea.Was the plague's cold hand settling upon him?Giddiness seized him, and he sat down again upon the rocks.In the road below a cloud of dust was rising, and across the distance
a murmur of voices floated up to his ears.He
wondered dully what additional trouble it portended.Rosendo came to
him at that moment."_Muy buenos dias, Padre._ I saw a boat come across the lake some
minutes ago.Jose struggled to his feet and
went forth to meet them."_Hola, Senor Padre Jose!_ _Dios mio_, but your hill is steep!"The man quickly gained the
summit, and hurried to grasp the bewildered priest's hand.don't you know me, _Senor Padre_?"he cried,
slapping Jose roundly upon the back.The light of recognition slowly came into the priest's eyes.The man
was Don Jorge, his erstwhile traveling companion on the Magdalena
river."And now a cup of that coffee, if you will do me the favor, my good
_Cura_.And then tell me what ails you here," he added, seating
himself."_Caramba_, what a town!Diego was right--the devil himself
made this place!But they say you have all taken to dying!_Caramba_, I do not wonder!Such a God-forsaken
spot!_Caramba!_ so they told me down below, and I would not
believe them!"One of our men brought it from Bodega Central."There isn't a trace of
cholera in the place, as far as I know!You have all gone crazy--but
small wonder!"His ears
were reporting things basely false."You say--" he began in
bewilderment."I say what I have said, _amigo_!There is no more cholera in Bodega
Central than there is in heaven!I arrived there day before yesterday,
and left before sunrise this morning.Jose sank weakly down at the man's side."But--Don Jorge--Feliz Gomez
returned from there three nights ago, and reported that a Turk, who
had come up from the coast, had died of the plague!"Don Jorge's brows knit in perplexity."I recall now," he said slowly,
after some moments of study."The innkeeper did say that a Turk had
died there--some sort of intestinal trouble, I believe.When I told
him I was bound for Simiti, he laughed as if he would split, and then
began to talk about the great fright he had given a man from here.Said he scared the fellow until his black face turned white.But I was
occupied with my own affairs, and paid him little attention.But come,
tell me all about it."With the truth slowly dawning upon his clouded thought, Jose related
the grewsome experiences of the past three days.But, was Feliz Gomez sick before he went to Bodega Central?""Yes, senor," interposed Rosendo."He and Amado Sanchez both had bowel
trouble.Their women told my wife so, after you and I, Padre, had come
up here to the hill.We have it here often, as you
know.""True," assented Jose, "but we have never given it any serious
thought."Don Jorge leaned back and broke into a roar of laughter."_Por el amor
del cielo!_ You are all crazy, _amigo_--you die like rats of fear!Did
you ever put a mouse into a bottle and then scare it to death with a
loud noise?_Hombre!_ That is what has happened to you!"The hill
reverberated with his loud shouts.But Jose could not share in the merriment.The awful consequences of
the innkeeper's coarse joke upon the childish minds of these poor,
impressionable people pressed heavily upon his heart.Bitter tears
welled to his eyes."We must go down and tell these people the
truth!"Don Jorge joined them, and they all hastened down into the town.Ramona Chaves met them in the _plaza_, her eyes streaming."Padre," she wailed, "my man Pedro has the sickness!loudly cried Jose; "there is no cholera
here!"He hastened to the bedside of the writhing Pedro.There
is no cholera in Simiti!He and Amado had only a touch of the flux, and they died
of fear!"The priest's ringing words acted upon the man like magic.He roused up
from his lethargy and stared at the assemblage.Don Jorge repeated the
priest's words, and added his own laughing and boisterous comments.Pedro rose from his bed, and stood staring.Together, their little band augmented at every corner by the startled
people, they hurried to the homes of all who lay upon beds of
sickness, spreading the glad tidings, until the little town was in a
state of uproar.Like black shadows before the light, the plague fled
into the realm of imagination from which it had come.By night, all
but Mateo Gil were up and about their usual affairs.But even Mateo
had revived wonderfully; and Jose was confident that the good news
would be the leaven of health that would work a complete restoration
within him in time.The exiles left the hilltop and the old church,
and returned again to their homes.Don Jorge took up his abode with
Jose."_Bien_," he said, as they sat at the rear door of the priest's house,
looking through the late afternoon haze out over the lake, "you have
had a strange experience--_Caramba_!most strange!--and yet one from
which you should gather an excellent lesson.You are dealing with
children here--children who have always been rocked in the cradle of
the Church.But--" looking archly at Jose, "do I offend?For, as I
told you on the boat a year ago, I do not think you are a good
priest.""_Bien_," he added, "I will correct that.You are good--but not a priest, is it not so?""I have some views, Don Jorge, which differ radically from those of
the faith," Jose said cautiously."_Caramba!_ I should hope so!""But," interposed Jose, anxious to direct the conversation into other
channels, "may I ask how and where you have occupied yourself since I
left the boat at Badillo?"said Don Jorge, shaking his head, although his eyes
twinkled."I have wandered ever since--and am poorer now than when I
started.I left our boat at Puerto Nacional, to go to Medellin; and
from there to Remedios and Guamoco.But while in the river town I met
another _guaquero_--grave hunter, you know--who was preparing to go to
Honda, to investigate the 'castles' at that place.There is a strange
legend--you may have heard it--hanging over those rocks.It appears
that a lone hermit lived in one of the many caverns in the great
limestone deposits rising abruptly from the river near the town of
Honda.Day after day, year after year,
he labored in his cave, extending it further into the hillside.People
laughed at him for tunneling in that barren rock, for gold has never
been found anywhere in it.But the fellow paid them no attention; and
gradually he was accepted as a harmless fanatic, and was left
unmolested to dig his way into the hill as far as he would.No one knew how the fellow lived, for he held no human
intercourse.Kind people often brought food and left it at the mouth
of his cavern, but he would have none of it.They brought clothes, but
they rotted where they were left.At last some good soul planted a fig tree near the cave, hoping that
the fruit in time would prove acceptable to him.One day they found
the tree cut down._Bien_, time passed, and he was forgotten.One day
some men, passing the cave, found his body, pale and thin, with long,
white hair, lying at the entrance.when they buried
the body they found it was that of a woman!"He paused to draw some leaves of tobacco from his wallet and roll a
thick cigar.The sudden turn of his story drew an expression of
amazement from the priest."_Bien_," he resumed, "where the woman came from, and who she was,
never was learned.But of course some one must have
supplied her with food and clothes all these years.Perhaps she was
some grand dame, with a dramatic past, who had come there to escape
the world and do penance for her sins.What sorrow, what black tragedy
that cave concealed, no one may ever know!Nor am I at all interested
in that.The point is, either she found gold there, or had a quantity
of it that she brought with her--at least so I thought at the time.So, when the _guaquero_ at Puerto Nacional told me the story, nothing
would do but I must go with him to search the cave._Caramba!_ We
wasted three full months prying around there--and had our labor for
our pains!"He tilted his chair back and puffed savagely at his cigar."Well, then I got on the windy side of another legend, a wild tale of
buried treasure in the vicinity of Mompox.Spent six months pawing the hot dirt around that old town.Fell in
with your estimable citizen, Don Felipe, who swindled me out of a
hundred good _pesos oro_ on a fraudulent location and a forged map.Then I cursed him and the place and went up to Banco."Don Jorge went on:

"Your genial friend Diego is back there.Told me about his trip to
Simiti to see his little daughter.""What did he say about her, _amigo_?""Not much--only that he expected to send for her soon.You know,
Rosendo's daughter is living with him."But, Don Jorge," pursued Jose anxiously, "what think you, is the
little Carmen Diego's child?""_Hombre!_ How should I know?"She does not look like him," asserted Jose, clinging to his note of
optimism._Caramba_, but he looks like an imp
from sheol!"Jose saw that little consolation was to be derived from Don Jorge as
far as Carmen was concerned."_Bien_," continued Don Jorge, whose present volubility was in
striking contrast to his reticence on the boat the year before, "I had
occasion to come up to Bodega Central--another legend, if I must
confess it.And there Don Carlos Norosi directed me here.""Yes, no doubt it appears so to you, _Senor Padre_," replied Don
Jorge."And yet my business, that of treasure hunting, has in times
past proved very lucrative.The Indian graves of Colombia have yielded
enormous quantities of gold.The Spaniards opened many of them; and in
one, that of a famous chieftain, discovered down below us, near
Zaragoza, they found a solid gold pineapple, a marvelous piece of
workmanship, and of immense value.it never would have reached him if I had been there!"But," he resumed, "we have no idea of the amount of treasure that has
been buried in various parts of Colombia.This country has been, and
still is, enormously rich in minerals--a veritable gold mine of
itself.And since the time of the Spanish conquest it has been in a
state of almost constant turmoil.And, up to very recent times, whenever the people collected a bit of
gold above their daily needs, they promptly banked it with good Mother
Earth.Then, like as not, they got themselves killed in the wars, and
the treasure was left for some curious and greedy hunter like myself
to dig up years after.The Royalists and Tories buried huge sums all
over the country during the War of Independence.Why, it was only a
year or so ago that two men came over from Spain and went up the
Magdalena river to Bucaramanga.They were close-mouthed fellows,
well-dressed, and evidently well-to-do.But they had nothing to say to
anybody.The innkeeper pried around until he discovered that they
spent much time in their room poring over maps and papers.Then they
set off alone, with an outfit of mules and supplies to last several
weeks._Bueno_, they came back at last with a box of good size, made
of mahogany, and bound around with iron bands._Caramba!_ They did not
tarry long, you may be sure.And I learned afterward that they sailed
away safely from Cartagena, box and all, for sunny Spain, where, I
doubt not, they are now living in idleness and gentlemanly ease on
what they found in the big coffer they dug up near that old Spanish
city."To him, cooped up for a year and more in the
narrow confines of Simiti, the ready flow of this man's conversation
was like a fountain of sparkling water to a thirsty traveler.He urged
him to go on, plying him with questions about his strange avocation."_Caramba_, but the old Indian chiefs were wise fellows!""They seemed to know that greedy vandals like myself would
some day poke around in their last resting places for the gold that
was always buried with them--possibly to pay their freight across the
dark river.And so they dug their graves in the form of an L, in the
extreme tip of which the royal carcasses were laid.In this way they
have deceived many a grave-hunter, who dug straight down without
finding the body, which was safely tucked away in the toe of the L. I
have gone back and reopened many a grave that I had abandoned as
empty, and found His Royal Highness five or six feet to one side of
the straight shaft I had previously sunk.""I suppose," mused Jose, "that you now follow this work because of its
fascination--for you must have found and laid aside much treasure in
the years that you have pursued it.""_ ejaculated the _guaquero_."I have been rich and poor,
like the rising and setting of the sun!What I find, I spend again
hunting more.The man who has enough money
never knows it.And his greed for more--more that he needs not, and
cannot possibly spend on himself--generally results, as in my case, in
the loss of what he already has.But there are reasons aside from the
excitement of the chase that keep me at it."He fell strangely silent, and Jose knew that there were aroused within
him memories that seared the tissues of the brain as they entered."_Amigo_," Don Jorge resumed."There are some things which I am trying to forget.This exciting and
dangerous business of mine keeps my thought occupied.I care nothing
now for the treasure I may discover."Surely, good friend," replied Jose quickly; "and I ask pardon for
recalling those things to you.""_ said Don Jorge, with a gesture of deprecation.Then: "I told you on the boat that I had lost a wife and girl.I tell you this because I know you, too, have
grievances against her._Caramba!_ Yet I will tell you only a part.I
lived in Maganguey, where my wife's brother kept a store and did an
excellent commission business.I was mining and hunting graves in the
Cauca region, sometimes going up the Magdalena, too, and working on
both sides of the river.Maganguey was a convenient place for me to
live, as it stands at the junction of the two great rivers.Besides,
my wife wished to remain near her own people._Bien_, we had a
daughter.And then, one day, the priest
told my wife that the girl was destined to a great future, and must
enter a convent and consecrate herself to the Church._Caramba!_ I am
not a Catholic--was never one!My parents were patriots, and both took
part in the great war that gave liberty to this country.But they were
liberal in thought; and I was never confirmed to the Church._Bien_,
the priest made my life a hell--my wife became estranged from me--and
one day, returning from the Cauca, I found my house deserted.Wife and
girl and the child's nurse had gone down the river!"The man's face darkened, and hard lines drew around his mouth."They had taken my money chest, some thousands of pesos.He laughed at me, and--_Caramba_!I struck him such a blow
between his pig eyes that he lay senseless for hours!"Jose glanced at the broad shoulders and the great knots of muscle on
the man's arms.He was of medium height, but with a frame of iron."_Bien, Senor Padre_, I, too, fled wild and raving from Maganguey that
night, and plunged into the jungle.Months later I drifted down the
river, as far as Mompox.And there one day I chanced upon old
Marcelena, the child's nurse.Like a _cayman_ I seized her and dragged
her into an alley.She confessed that my wife and girl were living
there--the wife had become housekeeper for a young priest--the girl
was in the convent._Caramba!_ I hurled the woman to the ground and
turned my back upon the city!"Jose's interest in the all too common recital received a sudden
stimulus."Your daughter's name, Don Jorge, was--"

"Maria, _Senor Padre_.""And--she would now be, how old, perhaps?""Fair--complexion light, like her mother's.Maria was a beautiful
child--and good as she was beautiful.""But--the child's nurse remained with her?"The woman was
old and ugly--but she loved the child.""Did you not inquire for them when you were in Mompox a few months
ago?""I made slight inquiry through the clerk in the office of the
Alcalde.I did not intend to--but I could not help it._Caramba!_ He
made further inquiry, but said only that he was told they had long
since gone down to Cartagena, and nothing had been heard from them."The gates of memory's great reservoir opened at the touch of this
man's story, and Jose again lived through that moonlit night in
Cartagena, when the little victim of Wenceslas breathed out her life
of sorrow and shame in his arms.He heard again the sobs of Marcelena
and the simple-minded Catalina.He saw again the figure of the
compassionate Christ in the smoke that drifted past the window.And
now the father of that wronged girl sat before him, wrapped in the
tatters of a shredded happiness!Should he say
that he had cared for this man's little grandson since his advent into
this sense of existence that mortals call life?For there could be no
doubt now that the little Maria was his daughter."Don Jorge," he said, "you have suffered much.And yet--"

"_Na_, Padre, there is nothing to do.Were I to find my family I could
only slay them and the priests who came between us!""But, Don Jorge," cried Jose in horror, "you surely meditate no such
vengeance as that!""_Senor Padre_," he returned coldly, "I am
Spanish.The blood of the old cavaliers flows in my veins.I have been
betrayed, trapped, fooled, and my honored name has been foully soiled._Caramba!_
The priest of Maganguey who poured the first drop of poison into my
wife's too willing ears--_Bien_, I have said enough!""_Hombre!_ You don't mean--"

"I mean, _Senor Padre_, that I drifted down the river, unseen, to
Maganguey one night."_Na_, Padre, not God, but Satan!Don Jorge leaned forward and laid a hand
upon his knee."My friend," he said evenly, "you are young--how old,
may I ask?"_Bien_, you have much to learn.I took to you on
the boat because I knew you had made a mess of things, and it was not
entirely your fault.You are no more in
the Church than I am."I--I have--work here, senor," he replied."True," said Don Jorge, "a chance to do much for these poor people--if
the odds are not too strong against you.But--are you working for them
alone?Or--does Diego's child figure in the case?No offense, I assure
you--I have reason to ask."The man looked squarely into his own,
and the priest found no deception in their black depths."I--senor, she cannot be Diego's child--and I--I would save her!""_Bien_," he said, "to-morrow I leave for
San Lucas.After the evening meal the _guaquero_ spread his _petate_ upon the
floor and disposed himself for the night.He stubbornly refused to
accept the priest's bed."_ he muttered, after he had lain
quiet for some time, "why does not the Church permit its clergy to
marry, like civilized beings!Do you know, _Senor Padre_, I once met a
woman in Bogota and held some discussion with her on this topic.She
said, as between a priest who had children, and a married minister,
she would infinitely prefer the priest, because, as she put it, no
matter how dissolute the priest, the sacraments from his hands would
still retain their validity--but never from those of a married
minister!_Caramba!_ what can you do against such bigotry and awful
narrowness, such dense ignorance!The following morning, before sunrise, Don Jorge and his boatmen were
on the lake, leaving Jose to meditate on the vivid experiences of the
past few days, their strange mental origin, and the lesson which they
brought.CHAPTER 22


"Padre dear," said Carmen, "you know the question that we put under
the altar of the old church?Well, God answered it, didn't He?""I--why, I had forgotten it, child.You asked Him to tell
us why the people thought they had to die, did you not?"Why, He told us that they were frightened to death, you know."They paid the
penalty of death for believing that Feliz Gomez had slept on a bed
where a man had died of the plague.They died because they--"

"Because they didn't know that God was everywhere, Padre dear,"
interrupted Carmen.And yet," he
added sadly, "how are we going to make them know that He is
everywhere?""Why, Padre dear, by showing them in our talk and our actions that we
know it--by proving it, you know, just as we prove our problems in
algebra.""Yes, poor Feliz, and Amado, and Guillermo died because they sinned,"
he mused."They broke the first Commandment by believing that there
was another power than God.And that sin brought its inevitable wage,
death.They'missed the mark,' and sank into the oblivion of their
false beliefs.that I could keep my own mentality free from
these same carnal beliefs, and so be a true missionary to suffering
humanity!But you, Carmen, you are going to be such a missionary.And
I believe," he muttered through his set teeth, "that I am appointed to
shield the girl until God is ready to send her forth!But what, oh,
what will she do when she meets that world which lies beyond her
little Simiti?""The deposit will not last much
longer," he said to Jose, shaking his head dubiously."And then--"

"Why, then we will find another, Rosendo," replied the priest
optimistically."_ exclaimed the old man, starting for the trail.The day after Don Jorge's departure the Alcalde returned.He stole
shamefacedly through the streets and barricaded himself in his house.He cruelly abused his
long-suffering spouse, and ended by striking her across the face.After which he sat down and laboriously penned a long letter to Padre
Diego, in which the names of Jose and Carmen figured plentifully.For Don Jorge had met the Alcalde in Juncal, and had roundly jeered
him for his cowardly flight.He cited Jose and Rosendo as examples of
valor, and pointed out that the Alcalde greatly resembled a captain
who fled at the smell of gunpowder.Don Mario swelled with indignation
and shame.His spleen worked particularly against Rosendo and the
priest.Come what might, it was time Diego and his superiors in
Cartagena knew what was going on in the parish of Simiti!A few days later an unctuous letter came to Jose from Diego,
requesting that Carmen be sent to him at once, as he now desired to
place her in a convent and thus supplement the religious education
which he was sure Jose had so well begun in her.The priest had
scarcely read the letter when Don Mario appeared at the parish house."_Bien, Padre_," he began smoothly, but without concealing the malice
which lurked beneath his oily words, "Padre Diego sends for the little
Carmen, and bids me arrange to have her conveyed at once to Banco.I
think Juan will take her down, is it not so?""No, senor," he said in a voice
that trembled with agitation, "it is not so!""_ exclaimed Don Mario, swelling with suppressed rage."You
refuse to give Diego his own child?""No, _senor_, but I refuse to give him a child that is not his.""_Caramba!_ but she is--he has the proofs!And I shall send her to him
this day!"The Alcalde shrilled forth his rage like a ruffled parrot.Jose seized
him by the shoulders and, turning him swiftly about, pushed him out
into the road.He then entered the rear door of Rosendo's house and
bade Dona Maria keep the child close to her.A few minutes later Fernando Perez appeared at Jose's door.He was
municipal clerk, secretary, and constable of Simiti, all in one.He
saluted the priest gravely, and demanded the body of the child Carmen,
to be returned to her proper father.What could he do against the established
authority?"_Bien, Padre_," said Fernando, after delivering his message, "the
hour is too late to send her down the river to-day.But deliver her to
me, and she shall go down at daybreak.""Listen," Jose pleaded desperately, "Fernando, leave her here
to-night--this is sudden, you must acknowledge--she must have time to
take leave of Dona Maria--and--"

"_Senor Padre_, the Alcalde's order is that she go with me now.Scarce knowing what he did, he
quickly stepped back through the rear door, and going to Rosendo's
house, seized a large _machete_, with which he returned to face the
constable."Look you, Fernando," he cried, holding the weapon menacingly aloft,
"if you lay a hand on that girl, I will scatter your brains through
yonder _plaza_!""_ muttered the constable, falling back."_Bien_," he
hastily added, "I will make this report to the Alcalde!"But he hastily arose and went into Rosendo's
house.he cried excitedly, "leave Carmen with me, and do
you hurry through the town and see if Juan is here, and if Lazaro
Ortiz has returned from the _hacienda_.Bid them come to me at once,
and bring their _machetes_!"Jose seized his _machete_ firmly in
one hand, and with the other drew Carmen to him.the child asked, her eyes big with wonder.I wish you wouldn't always go around thinking
that two and two are seven!""Carmen, child--you do not understand--you are too young, and as yet
you have had no experience with--with the world!"I do _not_ trust you, Padre," she said sadly."I can't trust anybody
who always sees things that are not so.""Carmen--you are in danger--and you do not comprehend--" cried the
desperate man."I am _not_ in danger--and I _do_ understand--a great deal better than
you do, Padre.People who are afraid
die of the plague!"The irony of her words sank into his soul."No, senor," the lad replied."She is searching for you--have you your _machete_?""Yes, Padre, I have just come back from the island, where I was
cutting wood."He went to the door and looked eagerly down the street.he
exclaimed with relief, "here come Dona Maria and Lazaro!Now,
friends," he began, when they were assembled before him, "grave danger
threatens--"

"Padre!"he cried, "go at once to the Boque trail!Let no one pass
that way with Carmen, if your life be the penalty!If either of you see her, call loudly, and I will come!Dona
Maria, start through the town!*       *       *       *       *

The afternoon dragged its interminable length across the valley.Jose
wearily entered his house and threw himself upon a chair.He had not
dared call at the Alcalde's house, for fear he might do that official
violence.But he had seen Fernando in the street, and had avoided him.Then, of a sudden, a thought came to him from out the darkness.He
sprang to his feet and hurried off toward the shales.There, beneath
the stunted _algarroba_ tree, sat the child.He rushed to her and clasped her in his arms."Padre," she replied, when she could get her breath, "I had to come
out here and try to know for you the things you ought to know for
yourself."He said nothing; but, holding her hand tightly, he led her back to the
house.That evening Jose sent for Don Mario, the constable, and Juan and
Lazaro.Assembling them before him in his living room, he talked with
them long and earnestly."_Compadres_," he said, "this week we have passed through a sad
experience, and the dark angel has robbed us of three of our beloved
friends.Is it your wish that death again visit us?"The Alcalde scowled darkly at
the priest beneath his heavy brows.Jose continued:

"_Bien_, it is planned to seize the little Carmen by force, and send
her down the river to Padre Diego--"

_"Dios y diablo!The Alcalde shrank back in his chair."Padre Diego sends for her by
letter--is it not so, Don Mario?"Juan wheeled about and stared menacingly at the
bulky official."Now, friends," Jose pursued, "it has not been shown that Carmen
belongs to Diego--in fact, all things point to the conclusion that she
is not his child.My wish is to be just to all concerned.But shall we
let the child go to him, knowing what manner of man he is, until it is
proven beyond all doubt that he is her father?""And I am of the opinion that the majority of our citizens would
support us in the contention."Every man in Simiti, Padre," replied Lazaro earnestly."Don Mario," said Jose, turning to the Alcalde, "until it is
established that Diego has a parent's claim to the girl, Juan and
Lazaro and I will protect her with our lives.Is it not so, _amigos_?""_Hombre!_ Let me see a hand laid upon her!"I
know you to be q good man--not like Padre Diego.I know not what claim
he may have on the girl, but this I say: I will follow and support you
until it is shown me that you are in the wrong."Then, to the town officials:

"_Bien, amigos_, we will let the matter rest thus, shall we not?If harm comes to the child, the death
angel will again stalk through this town, and--" he looked hard at Don
Mario, whilst that official visibly shrank in size--"_Bien_," he
concluded, "a sharp watch will be kept over the child.We will submit
to proofs--but to nothing less.cried Don Mario, at last finding his voice."If
Diego has the Bishop back of him, he will force us to deliver the
girl--or the Bishop will have the government soldiers sent here!I can
ask for them--and if necessary I will!"Don Mario,
seeing that his words had taken effect, quickly followed up the
advantage."Now you, Juan and Lazaro, do you think the little whelp
worth that?"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Juan leaped across the
floor and fell upon him.Jose seized the lad and, with Fernando's
help, tore him loose.Lazaro held his _machete_ aloft, ready to
strike.Jose's voice rang out sharply:

"Hold, men!Juan, do you stay here
with me!"The lad faced the Alcalde and shook his fist."_Bien_," he sputtered,
"send for the soldiers, fat dog that you are!But when I see them
crossing the lake, I will come first to your house and cut open that
big belly!"shrilled the Alcalde, shaking with rage."I will cut off the hand that is laid on Juan!"And for
God's sake think twice before you make any further move!"Don Mario and his constable departed in sullen silence.Jose let
Lazaro out through the rear door, while he bade Juan pass the night in
the parish house.A consultation was held with Dona Maria, and it was
arranged that Carmen should sleep in the room with Jose, with Juan
lying before the door, until Rosendo should return from the mountains.Then Jose sat down and wrote to the Bishop.*       *       *       *       *

No reply came from Cartagena until Rosendo returned at the end of the
month.Meanwhile, Jose had never for a moment permitted Carmen to
leave his side.The child chafed under the limitation; but Jose and
Dona Maria were firm.Juan lived with the priest; and Lazaro lurked
about the parish house like a shadow.The Alcalde and his constable
remained discreetly aloof.But with Rosendo's return came letters from both Wenceslas and Diego.The latter had laid aside his unction, and now made a curt and
peremptory demand upon Jose for the child.The letter from Wenceslas
was noncommittal, stating only that he was quite uninformed of Diego's
claim, but that an investigation should be made.Jose wondered if he
had blundered in laying the case before him."_ ejaculated Rosendo, when he heard Jose's story.And now the Bishop has the matter in hand!_Caramba!_ We
shall lose her yet!"And, Padre," he added, "the deposit is played out.And, now that we shall have none to send to the Bishop
each month, Carmen's fate is settled--unless we go away.He hung his head
and sat in gloomy dejection.For more than a year Rosendo had panned the isolated alluvial deposit,
and on his regular monthly returns to Simiti he and the priest had
sent from thirty to ninety _pesos_ gold to Wenceslas.To this Jose
sometimes added small amounts collected from the people of Simiti,
which they had gratuitously given him for Masses and for the support
of the parish.Wenceslas, knowing the feeble strength of the parish,
was surprised, but discreet; and though he continually urged Jose to
greater efforts, and held out the allurements of "indulgences and
special dispensations," he made no inquiries regarding the source of
the monthly contributions.For many days following, Rosendo and the priest went about as in a
thick, black cloud."Rosendo," said Jose at length, "go back to the
mountains and search again.Have we any reason
to doubt Him now?""And leave Carmen here, exposed to the danger that always hangs over
her?I would not go back now even if the deposit were
not worked out!Jose knew it would be futile to urge him.Carmen came to the priest that same day."Padre, I heard you and padre
Rosendo talking this morning."Why, child--there seems to be a need just at present," he replied
lightly."But we might--well, we might send another of your questions
to God.she cried delightedly, turning at once and hurrying away
for pencil and paper."Now," she panted, seating herself at the table."Let us see; we want
Him to give us _pesos_, don't we?""Well, you know, Padre dear," she replied seriously, "we can't ask for
too much--for we already have everything, haven't we?After all, we
can only ask to see what we really already have."Say 'yes,' Padre dear," she pleaded, looking up appealingly at him
staring silently at her.Oh, if she could only impart to him even a
little of her abundant faith!"Well, here it is," she said, holding out the paper.He took it and read--"Dear, dear God: Padre Jose needs _pesos_--lots
of them."And now," she continued, "shall we put it under the altar of the old
church?"He smiled; but immediately assumed an expression of great seriousness."Why not in the church here, the one we are using?"But--no, we will go where we went before," she concluded firmly.Taking matches and a piece of candle, he set off
with the girl in a circuitous route for the hill, which they gained
unobserved.Within the musty old church he struck a light, and they
climbed over the _debris_ and to the rear of the crumbling altar."Here is my other question that He
answered!She drew the old paper from beneath the adobe brick."Let us put this question in a new place," she said."Look,
up there, where the bricks have fallen out," pointing to the part of
the altar that had crumbled away.His thought was far
off, even in Cartagena, where sat the powers that must be held quiet
if his cherished plans were not to fail.He reached out and grasped
one of the projecting bricks to steady himself.As he did so, the
brick, which was loose, gave way with him, and he fell, almost across
Carmen, followed by a shower of rubbish, as another portion of the old
altar fell out."_ he ejaculated, picking himself up."What good luck that
the candle was not extinguished!And now, senorita, are you willing
that we should bury this important question here on the floor; or must
I again try to put it in the altar itself?""Up there," insisted the child, laughing and still pointing above.He rose and looked about, searching for a convenient place to deposit
the paper.Then something attracted his attention, something buried in
the altar, but now exposed by the falling out of the fresh portion.It
was metal, and it glittered in the feeble candle light.He reached in
and hastily scraped away more of the hard mud.Then, trembling with
suppressed excitement, he pulled out another brick.Clearly, it was a
box that had been buried in there--who knows when?He gave the candle
to Carmen and bade her stand up close.Then with both hands he
carefully removed the adjacent bricks until the entire box was in
view."A box to put our question in,
Padre!"muttered the excited priest,
straining and tugging away at it."Now--" He gave a final pull.A crash of falling bricks
followed; the candle was extinguished; and both he and the child were
precipitated to the floor.called the priest, choking with dust, "are you hurt?""No, Padre dear," came the laughing answer through the darkness."But
I'm pretty full of dust.It lay near, a small, wooden coffer,
bound about with two narrow bands of steel.He dragged it out and bore
it down the aisle to the door, followed by Carmen.He dusted it off and examined it carefully in the fast fading light.It was some twelve inches square by three deep, well made of mahogany,
and secured by a small, iron padlock.On the top there was a crest of
arms and the letters, "I de R," burned into the wood.Night had closed in, and the priest and girl made their way hurriedly
back home by way of the lake, to avoid being seen.Under his cassock
Jose carried the box, so heavy that it chafed the skin from his hip as
they stumbled along."Carmen, say nothing--but tell your padre Rosendo to come to me at
once!"With the doors secured, and Carmen and Dona Maria standing guard
outside to apprise them of danger, Jose and Rosendo covertly examined
the discovery.pondered Rosendo, studying the box.Then--"_Caramba!_
Padre--_Caramba!_ It is _Ignacio de Rincon!_ _Hombre!_ And the
crest--it is his!I have seen it before--years and years ago!_Caramba!_ _Caramba!_" The old man danced about like a child.he kept exclaiming, his eyes
big as saucers.Then, hastening out to get his iron bar, he returned
and with a blow broke the rusty padlock.Tearing open the hinged
cover, he fell back with a loud cry.Before their strained gaze, packed carefully in sawdust, lay several
bars of yellow metal.Rosendo took them out with trembling hands and
laid them upon the floor._Caramba!--_

"Hold these, Padre!"hurrying out and returning with a pair of
homemade wooden balances.Again and again he carefully weighed the
bars.It seemed to Jose that the old man
wasted hours arriving at a satisfactory result."Padre," he finally announced in tones which he strove vainly to
control, "there cannot be less than six thousand _pesos oro_ here!""Six thousand _pesos_--twenty-four thousand
francs!The trembling old man replaced the bars and carried them to Jose's
bed.The priest opened the door and called to Carmen."What was in the old box, Padre?"she asked happily, bounding into the
room.He stooped and picked her up, almost crushing her in his arms."The
answer to your question, _chiquita_.'Before they call I will answer:
and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.'"CHAPTER 23


When Jose awoke the next morning he quickly put his hand under his
pillow.He
drew it forth and raised the cover.The yellow bars glittered in the
morning rays sifting through the overhanging thatch at the window.He
passed his hand gently across them.His heart leaped within him as he hastily threw on his scant
attire and went out into the balsamic air of the tropical morning.Rosendo had gone to the village of Boque, starting before sun-up, so
Dona Maria announced.Some sudden impulse had seized him, and he had
set out forthwith, not stopping to discuss the motive with his
faithful consort.Jose concluded his _desayuno_, and then summoned
Carmen to the parish house for the day's lessons.She came with a song
on her lips."Don't stop, _chiquita_!Sing it again--it is beautiful; and my soul
drinks it in like heavenly dew!"he cried, as the child danced up to
him and threw her plump arms about his neck.She turned about and sat down on the dusty threshold and repeated the
little song.The glittering sunlight streamed through her rich curls
like stringers of wire gold.Cucumbra came fawning to her and nestled
at her little bare feet, caressing them at frequent intervals with his
rough tongue.Cantar-las-horas approached with dignified tread, and,
stopping before his adored little mistress, cocked his head to one
side and listened attentively, his beady eyes blinking in the dazzling
light.Had
either of her parents been so gifted?And yet, it was
only the voicing of a soul of stainless purity--a conscience clear as
the light that gilded her curls--a trust, a faith, a knowledge of
immanent good, that manifested daily, hourly, in a tide of happiness
whose far verge melted into the shore of eternity.As he sat with
closed eyes the adobe hut, with its dirt floor and shabby furnishings,
expanded into a castle, hung with richest tapestries, rarest pictures,
and glittering with plate of gold.The familiar odors of garlic and
saffron, which penetrated from the primitive kitchen of Dona Maria,
were transmuted into delicate perfumes.The sun drew nearer, and
suffused him with its glittering flood.The girl became a white-robed
vision, and her song a benediction, voicing "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace among men of good will."The song ended, and left the thought with him: "To men of good will?"Yes, to men of God's will--the will that is good--to men of sound
mind--that mind which was in Christ Jesus--the mind that knows no
evil!"_Chiquita_," the priest said gently, when the girl returned to him."Your question was quickly answered yesterday, was it not?""It was answered, Padre, before we asked
it.God has the answers to all questions that could ever be asked.We
would always know the answers if we thought the way He does.""But--tell me, _chiquita_, do you think He put that little box up
there in the altar purposely for us?""No, Padre--I guess it was hidden there by some man, long ago, who was
afraid he would lose it.And since he was afraid he would lose it,
why--he did, for now we have it.""Yes, the thing that he greatly feared came upon him.But what is your
idea regarding the way we happened to find it?"God leads to everything good, Padre dear," was the simple response.But, in this particular case--would we have been led to
the little box if you had not asked your question of God?"People are always led right when they think right.""And so thinking right was the cause of this discovery, was it?"he
pursued, relentlessly probing her thought to its depths."Why--yes, Padre--of course.We had to have money--you said so, you
know.And you told me to ask for lots of _pesos_.Well, we both knew
that God had already given us more _pesos_ than we could ever know
what to do with--He always does.He just can't help giving Himself to
everybody.And He gave Himself to us--why, we have always had Him!We
are _in_ Him, you know.And when anybody just knows that--why, he sees
nothing but good everywhere, and he always has all that he needs.""All that he wants, you mean, _chiquita_?""No, Padre, not all that he wants.You might
want all the gold in the world--but you wouldn't need it.""No, that would be only a selfish, human want.But--you still think we were led right to the little box, do you?""I know it, Padre dear," she replied emphatically."When we think
good, we see good.It is just as sure as
getting the right answers to my problems in algebra when I think right
about them.""And thinking right about them means using the right rule, does it
not?"If I didn't use the right rule--why, what sort of
answers would I get?But still," vigorously pursuing the subject,
"you don't think we happened upon the little box just by good luck?""Padre," she shook her curls insistently, "things never happen,
_never_!"Yes, there surely does seem to be a definite law of cause and effect.But you did not think gold yesterday, _chiquita_.""Oh, Padre dear, what a bother you are!No, I didn't think gold
yesterday.And that is
gold and everything else that we need.And it wasn't
just because I thought good yesterday, but because I think good every
day, that I saw the gold.It was because we needed it, and God had
already given us all that we needed.And I knew that it just _had_ to
come.Then, because we really needed it, and knew that
it was right and that it must come--well, it did.Her
little face was very serious as she looked up appealingly into his."Yes, _chiquita_, yes, I see.I just wanted to know how you would
explain it.It becomes clearer to me every day that there are no such
things as miracles--never were!Christ Jesus _never_ performed
miracles, if by that we mean that he set aside God's laws for the
benefit of mankind.But he acted in perfect accord with those
laws--and no wonder the results seemed miraculous to dull-witted human
minds, who had always seen only their coarse, material thought
externalized in material laws and objects, in chance, mixed good and
evil, and a God of human characteristics!""Yes--I--guess so, Padre dear--only, I don't understand your big
words.""Ah, _chiquita_, you understand far, far better than I do!Why, I am
learning it all from you!And Jose had learned by this time, too, that between merely
recognizing righteousness as right-thinking, and actually practicing
it--putting it to the test so as to "prove" God--there is a vast
difference.Things cannot be "thought" into existence, nor evils
"thought" away--the stumbling block of the mere tyro in the study of
mental cause and effect.A vast development in spirituality must
precede those "signs following" before mankind shall again do the
works of the Master.Jose knew this; and he bowed in humble
submission, praying for daily light.*       *       *       *       *

At dusk Rosendo returned."_Bien_, Padre, I have it now, I think!"he
cried excitedly, pacing back and forth in the little room.Come, while we eat I will tell you!"The little group gathered about the table, while Rosendo unfolded his
theory."I went to Boque this morning to talk with Dona Lucia.She is very
aged, the oldest inhabitant in these parts._Bien_, I knew that she
had known Don Ignacio, although she was not his slave.Her story
brought back to me also the things my father had often told me about
Don Ignacio's last trip to Simiti.Putting all these things together,
I think I now know how the little box came to be hidden in the altar
of the old church."The old man's eyes sparkled with happiness, while his auditors drew
closer about him to drink in his dramatic recital.For Rosendo, like a
true Latin, reveled in a wonder-tale.And his recitals were always
accompanied by profuse gesticulation and wonderful facial expressions
and much rolling of the eyes."_Bien_," he continued, "it was this way.Don Ignacio's possessions in
Guamoco were enormous, and in the then prosperous city of Simiti he
had stores and warehouses and much property.When the War of
Independence neared its end, and he saw that the Royalist cause was
lost, he made a last and flying trip to Simiti, going up the Magdalena
river from Cartagena in his own _champan_, propelled by some of his
still faithful slaves."_Bien_, he found that one of his foremen had just returned from the
mountains with the final clean-up from La Libertad _arrastras_.These
had been abandoned, for most of the slaves had deserted, or gone to
fight the Spaniards.But the foreman, who was not a slave, but a
faithful employe, had cleaned up the _arrastras_ and hidden the
amalgam until he could find a favorable opportunity to come down to
Simiti with it."Now, when Don Ignacio arrived here, he found the town practically
deserted.So he and the foreman retorted the amalgam and melted the
gold into bars.But, just as they had completed their task, a
messenger came flying to town and reported that a body of Royalist
soldiers were at Badillo, and that they had learned that Simiti was
the _bodega_ of the rich Guamoco district, and were preparing to come
over and sack the town.They were fleeing down the river to the coast,
to get away to Spain as soon as possible, but had put off at Badillo
to come over here.Fortunately, they had become very intoxicated, and
their expedition was for that reason delayed."_Bueno_, at the news the foreman dropped everything and fled for his
life.A few people gathered with the priest in the Rincon church, the
one you are using now, Padre.The priest of the other old church on
the hill fled._Caramba_, but he was a coward--and he got well paid
for it, too!"Don Ignacio's _champan_ was at Badillo, and he had come across to
Simiti by canoe._Bien_, he dared not take this gold back with him;
and so he thought of hiding it in one of the churches, for that is
always a sacred place.There were people in his own church, and so he
hurried to the one on the hill.Evidently, as he looked about in the
deserted building for a place to hide the bars, he saw that some of
the bricks could easily be removed from the rear of the altar.A
couple of hours sufficed to do the work of secreting the box.Then he
fled across the shales to the town of Boque, where he got a canoe to
take him down to the Magdalena; and there he waited until he saw the
soldiers come across and enter the _cano_.Don Nicolas, son of Dona Lucia, was his boatman, and he says that he
remained with your grandfather at that place over night, and that
there they received the report that the Royalists had been terribly
whipped in the battle--the battle of--_Caramba_!I forget--"

"Of Ayacucho," suggested Jose."_Bien_, there was nothing for the poor
man to do but hasten down the river to Cartagena as fast as possible,
for he knew not what might have befallen his family.He did not dare
go back to Simiti then for the box.And so the gold was left in the
altar.""Now I understand what he meant by that
note in his old diary, which we had in my father's house, in Spain!Arriving in Cartagena he went at once to the Department of
Mines and tore out all the pages of the register that contained
descriptions of his mineral properties.He intended some day to return
to Guamoco and again locate them.And meantime, he protected himself
by destroying all the registered locations.It was easy for him to do
this, influential as he was in Cartagena.And doubtless at that stormy
time the office of the Department of Mines was deserted.This note,
Rosendo, I have read in his old diary, many times, but never knew to
what it referred.""_Bueno_, the soldiers sacked Simiti
and slaughtered all the people they could find.Then they set fire to
the town, and left."But now for the old church and the picture of the Virgin that was
lost during the terrible storm when the priest fell dead.We will have
to guess that later, when peace had been restored, the priest of the
old church in prying around the altar discovered the loose bricks and
the box behind them._Bueno_, the night of the awful storm he had gone
secretly to the church to remove the box.I remember that my father
said the priest had arranged for my father to take him down to Bodega
Central the very next day.You see, he was going to flee with the
gold, the rogue!_Bien_, while he was in the church taking out the
loose bricks, that storm broke--and, from what I remember, it was
terrible!The heavens were ablaze with lightning; the thunder roared
like cannon; and the lake rose right out of its bed!_Caramba!_ The
door of the church crashed open, and the wind whistled in and blew out
the candles on the altar.The wind also tore loose a beautiful picture
of the Virgin that was hanging near the altar.The picture was blown
out of its frame and swept off to the hills, or into the lake.It was
never seen again, although the frame was found just outside the door.Perhaps it was the extinguishing of the candles and the falling of the
picture that frightened the old priest so terribly.At any rate he ran
from the church to his house, and when he reached his door he fell
dead of apoplexy."_Bueno_, after that you could never get any of the Simiti people to
enter the church again.They closed the doors and left it, just as it
was, for they thought the curse of God had fallen upon it because it
had been erected by the enemies of the Rincon family, whose patron
saint was the blessed Virgin herself.Well, the old altar began to
crumble, and parts of it fell away from time to time.And when the
people heard the bricks falling they said it was the bad angel that
the Virgin had locked in there--the angel of Satan that had
extinguished the candles on the altar that night of the storm._Caramba!_ And I believed it, too!I am a fool, Padre, a fool!""We are all fools, Rosendo, when we yield ourselves to superstition
and false belief," said Jose solemnly."But you have worked out a very
ingenious story, and I doubt not you have come very near to accounting
in the right way for the presence of the little box in the altar.But
now, _amigo_, come with me to my house."It is this, Rosendo," he said, when they were alone."We now have
gold, and the way has been providentially opened.Carmen is in great
danger here.What say you, shall we take her and leave Simiti?""Padre," he said at length, "you are right.It would be best for her
if we could get her away.But--you would have to leave the country.I
see now that neither she nor you would be safe anywhere in Colombia if
you left Simiti.""And I am sure that no country
offers the asylum that America does--the America of the north.I
have never been there, _amigo_; but of all countries I learn that it
is the most tolerant in matters religious.And it offers the
greatest opportunities to one, like Carmen, just entering upon life.And, Rosendo, prepare yourself and Dona Maria at
once, for we had best start without delay.""No, Padre," he said slowly.I could
not go to the North with you; nor could Maria."exclaimed the priest impatiently, "why?""_Bien_, Padre, we are old.And we know not the language of those up
there.We could not adapt ourselves to their ways of
life--no, not at our age.You tell me they have cold, ice, snow, up there."_Bien_, Padre, do you go, and take the girl.Bring her up to be a
power for good in that great land.We--Maria and I--will remain in
Simiti.It is not permitted that we should ever leave.This has always
been our home, and here we will die.""No, Padre, we could not make so great a change.Anywhere in Colombia
would be but little different from Simiti.But up north--in that great
country where they do those wonderful things you have told me
about--no, Padre, Maria and I could not make so great a change."But, Padre," he continued, "what will you do--leave the Church?Or
will you still be a priest up there?"In the great joy which the
discovery of the gold had stimulated, and in the thought of the
possibilities opened by it, he had given no heed to his status
respecting the Church.Yet, if he remained in the Church, he could not
make this transfer without the approval of the Vatican.And that, he
well knew, could not be obtained.No, if he went, he must leave behind
all ecclesiastical ties.And with them, doubtless, the ties which
still bound him to his distant mother and the family whose honored
name he bore.It was not so easy a matter to take the girl and leave
Simiti, now that he gave the project further consideration.And yet he could not abandon the idea, however great his present sense
of disappointment.He would cling to it as an ideal, some day to be
realized, and to be worked up to as rapidly as might be, without
exciting suspicion, and without abruptly severing the ties which, on
serious reflection, he found he was not morally strong enough as yet
to break."_Bien_, Rosendo," he concluded in chastened tones."We will think it
over, and try to devise ways to accomplish the greatest good for the
child."The way will be shown us some time,
Padre!""And while we wait, we will keep our eyes open,
no?"Yes, Jose would keep his eyes open and his heart receptive.After
all, as he meditated the situation in the quiet of his little cottage
that evening, he was not sorry that circumstances kept him longer in
Simiti.For he had long been meditating a plan, and the distraction
incident upon a complete change of environment certainly would delay,
if not entirely defeat, its consummation.He had planned to
translate his Testament anew, in the light of various works on
Bible criticism which the explorer had mentioned, and which the
possession of the newly discovered gold now made attainable.He had
with him his Greek lexicon.He would now, in the freedom from
interruption which Simiti could and probably would afford for the
ensuing few months, give himself up to his consecrated desire to
extract from the sacred writings the spiritual meaning crystallized
within them.The vivid experiences which had fallen to him in
Simiti had resulted in the evolution of ideas--radically at variance
with the world's materialistic thought, it is true--which he was
learning to look upon as demonstrable truths.The Bible had slowly
taken on a new meaning to him, a meaning far different from that
set forth in the clumsy, awkward phrases and expressions into which
the translators so frequently poured the wine of the spirit, and
which, literally interpreted, have resulted in such violent
controversies, such puerile ideas of God and His thought toward man,
and such religious hatred and bigotry, bloodshed, suffering, and
material stagnation throughout the so-called Christian era.He would
approach the Gospels, not as books of almost undecipherable
mystery, not as the biography of the blessed Virgin, but as
containing the highest human interpretation of truth and its relation
to mankind."I seek knowledge," he repeated aloud, as he paced back and forth
through his little living room at night; "but it is not a knowledge
of Goethe, of Kant, or Shakespeare; it is not a knowledge of the
poets, the scientists, the philosophers, all whom the world holds
greatest in the realm of thought; it is a knowledge of Thee, my
God, to know whom is life eternal!Men think they can know Homer,
Plato, Confucius--and so they can.But they think they can _not_
know Thee!And yet Thou art nearer to us than the air we breathe, for
Thou art Life!What is there out in the world among the multifold
interests of mankind that can equal in importance a demonstrable
knowledge of Thee?Not the unproven theories and opinions, the
so-called 'authority' of the ancient Fathers, good men though they
may have been; not modern pseudo-science, half-truths and relative
facts, saturated with materialism and founded on speculation and
hypothesis; but real knowledge, a knowledge of Thee that is as
demonstrable as the simplest rule in mathematics!that men
should be so mesmerized by their own beliefs as to say Thou canst
not be known.for the burden which such thinkers as Spencer
have laid upon the shoulders of stumbling mankind.For God _can_ be
known, and proven--else is Jesus responsible for the most cruel lie
ever perpetrated upon the ignorant, suffering world!"And so, putting aside a portion of his gold--his by right of
inheritance as well as discovery--for the future purchase of such
books and aids as he might require, Jose set his house in order and
then plunged into such a search of the Scriptures as rendered him
oblivious to all but the immediate interests of Carmen and her
foster-parents.The great world again narrowed into the rock-bound
confines of little Simiti.Each rushing morn that shot its fiery glow
through the lofty treetops sank quickly into the hush of noon, while
the dust lay thick, white, and hot on the slumbering streets of the
ancient town; each setting sun burned with dreamy radiance through the
afternoon haze that drew its filmy veil across the seething valley;
each night died into a stillness, lonely and awful.Nature changed her
garb with monotonous regularity; the drowsing children of this tropic
region passed their days in dull torpidity; Jose saw nothing of it
all.At times a villager would bring a tale of grievance to pour into
his ears--perhaps a jaguar had pounced upon his dog on his little
_finca_ across the lake, or a huge snake had lured a suckling pig into
its cavernous maw.At times a credulous woman would stop before his
open door to dilate upon the thick worms that hung upon the leaves of
the _algarrobas_ and dropped their wool-like fibers upon the natives
as they passed below, causing intermittent fevers.Perhaps an anxious
mother would seek him for advice regarding her little son, who had
eaten too much dirt, and was suffering from the common "_jipitera_,"
that made his poor little abdomen protrude so uncomfortably.Again,
Rosendo might steal in for a few moments' mysterious, whispered talk
about buried treasure, or the fables of El Dorado and Parime.Jose had
time for them all, though as he listened his thought hovered ever
about the green verge of Galilee.By his side worked Carmen, delving assiduously into the mysteries
of mathematics and the modern languages.When the day's work closed
for them both, he often asked her to sing to him.And then, leaning
back with closed eyes, he would yield himself to the soft dreams
which her sweet voice called up from his soul's unfathomed depths.Often they walked together by the lake on a clear night; and on
these little excursions, during which they were never beyond
Rosendo's watchful eye, Jose reveled in the girl's airy gaiety and
the spontaneous flow of her sparkling thought.He called her his
domestic sunbeam; but in his serious moments--and they were
many--he studied her with a wistful earnestness, while he sought to
imbibe her great trust, her fearlessness, her unswerving loyalty to
the Christ-principle of immanent Good.He would never permit
restraint to be imposed upon her, even by Rosendo or his good wife.She knew not what it was to be checked in the freest manifestation
of her natural character.But there was little occasion for
restraint, for Carmen dwelt ever in the consciousness of a spiritual
universe, and to it paid faithful tribute.She saw and knew only
from a spiritual basis; and she reaped the rewards incident thereto.His life and hers were such as fools might label madness, a
colorless, vegetative existence, devoid of even the elemental
things that make mundane existence worth the while.But the
appraisal of fools is their own folly.Jose knew that the torrid
days which drew their monotonous length over the little town were
witnessing a development in both himself and the child that some day
would bear richest fruit.So far from being educated to distrust
spiritual power, as are the children of this world, Carmen was
growing up to know no other.Instead of the preponderance of her
belief and confidence being directed to the material, she was
developing the consciousness that the so-called evidence of the
physical senses is but mortal thought, the suppositional opposite of
the thought of the infinite God who says to mankind: "For I know the
thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace and not of
evil, to give you an expected end."Jose knew that his method of
education was revolutionary.But he also knew that it was not
wholly his; that the child had really taken this course herself,
as if led thereto by a power beyond them both.And so he watched her, and sought to learn from her as from Christ's
own loving and obedient disciple.It was because of his obedience to
God that Jesus was able to "prove" Him in the mighty works which we
call miracles.He said, "If any man will do His will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God."And Carmen
did do His will; she kept the very first Commandment; she walked by
faith, and not by the sight of the human senses.She had been called
an "_hada_," a witch, by the dull-witted folk of Simiti; and some day
it would be told that she had a devil.But the Master had borne the
same ignominy.And so has every pioneer in Truth, who has dared to lay
the axe at the roots of undemonstrable orthodox belief and entrenched
human error.Jose often trembled for the child when he thought of the probable
reception that awaited her in the world without, in case she ever
left Simiti.Would her supreme confidence in good ever be weakened by
an opposite belief in evil?Would her glorious faith ever be
neutralized or counterbalanced by faith in a power opposed to God?And sometimes in the fits of abstraction resulting from
these thoughts, the girl would steal up to him and softly whisper,
"Why, Padre, are you trying to make two and two equal seven?"Then he
would laugh with her, and remember how from her algebraic work she had
looked up one day and exclaimed, "Padre--why, all evil can be reduced
to a common denominator, too--_and it is zero_!"As recreation from the task of retranslating his Greek Testament, Jose
often read to Carmen portions from the various books of the Bible, or
told her the old sacred stories that children so love to hear.But
Carmen's incisive thought cut deep into them, and Jose generally found
himself hanging upon the naive interpretations of this young girl.When, after reading aloud the two opposing accounts of the Creation,
as given in the first and second chapters of Genesis, she asked, "But,
Padre, why did God change His mind after He made people and gave them
dominion over everything?"Jose was obliged to say that God had not
made a mistake, and then gone back afterward to rectify it; that the
account of the Creation, as given in Genesis, was not His, but was a
record of the dawning upon the human thought of the idea of the
spiritual Creation; that the "mist" which went up from the earth was
suppositional error; and that the record of the Creation which follows
after this was only the human mind's interpretation of the real,
spiritual Creation, that Creation which is the ever unfolding of
infinite Mind's numberless, perfect ideas.The book of Genesis has
been a fetish to human minds; and not until the limitations imposed by
its literal interpretation were in a measure removed did the human
mentality begin to rise and expand.And when, reading from Isaiah, the
grandest of the ancient prophets, the ringing words, "Cease ye from
man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?"the child asked him if that did not refer to the very
kind of people with whom they had daily intercourse, he had been
obliged to say that it did, and that that sort of man was far, very
far, from being the man of God's own creating."The mist, child, which is mentioned in the second chapter of Genesis,
is said to have gone up from the ground.That is, it went up from
matter.And so it is typical of materialism, from which all evil
comes.The material is the direct opposite of the spiritual.Every bit
of evil that men think they can see, or know, or do, comes as
testimony of the five material senses.These might well be called the
'ground' senses.In the book of Genesis, you will notice that the
account of the real comes first; then follows the account of its
opposite, the unreal man of dust.""The plus sign is followed by a minus
sign, isn't it?And the man made of dust is the real man with a minus
sign before him.""The man of dust is the human mind's interpretation of the spiritual
man, dear child," returned Jose."All human beings are interpretations
by the mortal, or human, mind of infinite Mind, God, and His spiritual
Creation.The interpretation is made in the human mind, and remains
there.The human mind does not see these interpretations outside of
itself--it does not see real men, and houses, and trees, outside of
itself--but it sees its mental interpretations of God, which it calls
men, and houses, and trees, and so on.These things are what we might
call _mental concepts_.They are the man and the creation spoken of in
the second chapter of Genesis after the mist went up from matter, from
the ground, from materialism, resulting in the testimony of the
physical senses.""But, Padre, they are not real--these mental concepts?"They are formed in mentalities that are
themselves wrong interpretations of the infinite Mentality, called
God.They are made up
of false thoughts, false opinions, beliefs of power opposed to God,
beliefs in evil, in sickness, disaster, loss, and death.They are the
results of educated and inherited and attached beliefs.They are
largely made up of fear-beliefs.The human mentalities see these
various beliefs combined in what it calls men and women, houses,
animals, trees, and so on, all through the material so-called
creation.It is this wrong interpretation that has caused all the
suffering and sorrow in the world.And it is this false stuff that the
good man Jesus finally said he had overcome.""How did he do it, Padre?""By knowing its nothingness, and by knowing the Allness of his Father,
infinite Mind.He called this false stuff a lie about God.And he
overcame that lie by knowing the truth--just as you overcome the
thought that you cannot solve your algebraic problems by knowing the
truth that will and does solve them.""But, Padre, you said once that Jesus was the best man that ever
lived.That is, the human minds all about him saw their
mental concepts of him as a man.But he was a human concept that most
clearly represented God's idea of Himself.Mortal, human minds are
like window-panes, _chiquita_.When a window-pane is very dirty, very
much covered with matter, only a little light can get through it.Some
human minds are cleaner, less material, than others, and they let more
light through.Jesus was the cleanest mind that was ever with us.He
kept letting more and more light--Truth--through himself, until at
last all the matter, even the matter composing the material concept
that people called his earthly body, dissolved in the strong light,
and the people saw him no more."And--Padre, don't we have to do that way, too?"We must, every one of us, do exactly as Jesus
did.We must wash ourselves clean--wash off the dirty beliefs of power
apart from God; we must wash off the beliefs of evil as a power,
created in opposition to Him, or permitted by Him to exist and to use
His children; we must wash off beliefs of matter as real and created
by Him.We must know that matter and all evil, all that decays and
passes away, all discord and disease, everything that comes as
testimony of the five physical senses, is but a part of the lie about
Him, the stuff that has the minus sign before it, making it less than
nothing.We must know that it is the suppositional opposite of the
real--it is an illusion, seeming to exist, yet evaporating when we try
to define it or put a finger on it, for it has no rule or principle by
which it was created and by which it continues to exist.No, Jose assured himself, the Gospels are not "loose, exaggerated,
inaccurate, credulous narratives."They are the story of the clearest
transparency to truth that was ever known to mortals as a human being.They preserve the life-giving words of him whose mission it was to
show mankind the way out of error by giving them truth.They contain
the rule given by the great Mathematician, who taught mankind how to
solve their life-problems.They tell the world plainly that there
seems to exist a lie about God; that every real idea of the infinite
Mind seems to have its suppositional opposite in a material illusion.They tell us plainly that resisting these illusions with truth renders
them nugatory.They tell us clearly that the man Jesus was so filled
with truth that he proved the nothingness of the lie about God by
doing those deeds that seemed marvelous in the eyes of men, and yet
which he said we could and should do ourselves.And we must do them,
if we would throw off the mesmerism of the lie.The human concept of
man and the universe must dissolve in the light of the truth that
comes through us as transparencies.And it were well if we set about
washing away the dirt of materialism, that the light may shine through
more abundantly.Jesus did not say that his great deeds were accomplished contrary to
law, but that they fulfilled the law of God.Ignorance of
spiritual law permits the belief in its opposite, material law, or
laws of matter.False, human beliefs, opinions, and theories, material
speculations and superstitions, parade before the human mind as laws.Jesus swept them all aside by knowing that their supposed power lay
only in human acceptance.The human mind is mesmerized by its own
false thought.Even Paul at times felt its mesmerism and exclaimed:
"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
me."The very idea of good stirs up its opposite in the human
consciousness.But Paul rose above it and saw its nothingness.Then
he cried: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
me free from the law of sin and death."He recognized the spiritual
law that Jesus employed; and with it he overcame the mesmerism of
the lie."To be a Christian, then," said Jose, "means not merely taking the
name of Christ, and, while morally opposing sin, succumbing to every
form of mesmerism that the lie about God exerts.It means recognizing the nature of God and His Creation,
including Man, to be wholly spiritual--and the nature of the material
creation and mankind as their opposite, as mental concepts, existing
as false interpretations of the spiritual Universe and Man, and as
having their place only in the false human consciousness, which itself
is a mental activity concerned only with false thought, the
suppositional opposite of God's thought.It means taking this Truth,
this spiritual law, as we would take a mathematical rule or principle,
and with it overcoming sin, sickness, discord of every name and
nature, even to death itself.What, oh, what have so-called Christians
been doing these nearly two thousand years, that they have not ere
this worked out their salvation as Jesus directed them to do?they have been mesmerized--simply mesmerized by the lie.The
millennium should have come long, long ago.It would come to-day if
the world would obey Jesus.But it will not come until it does obey
him."Day after day, week after week, month after month, Jose delved and
toiled, studied and pondered.The books which he ordered through the
Empresa Alemania, and for which for some two months he waited in
trembling anticipation and fear lest they be lost in transit, finally
arrived.When Juan brought them up from Bodega Central, Jose could
have wept for joy.Except for the very few letters he had received at
rare intervals, these were the only messages that had penetrated the
isolation of Simiti from the outside world in the two long years of
his exile.They afforded
his first introduction to that fearlessly critical thought regarding
things religious which has swept across the world like a tidal wave,
and washed away so many of the bulwarks of superstition and ignorance
bred of fear of the unknown and supposedly unknowable.And yet they were not really his first introduction to that
thought, for, as he pored over these books, his heart expanded
with gratitude to the brusque explorer whom he had met in Cartagena,
that genial, odd medley of blunt honesty, unquibbling candor, and
hatred of dissimulation, whose ridicule of the religious fetishism
of the human mentality tore up the last root of educated orthodox
belief that remained struggling for life in the altered soil of his
mind.But, though they tore down with ruthless hand, _these books did not
reconstruct_.He could understand why the trembling heart, searching wearily for
truth, turned always from such as they with sinking hope.They were
violently iconoclastic--they up-rooted--they overthrew--they swept
aside with unsparing hand--but they robbed the starving mortal of his
once cherished beliefs--they snatched the stale and feebly nourishing
bread from his mouth, and gave nothing in return.They emptied his
heart, and left it starving.What did it boot to tell a man that the
orthodox dream of eternal bliss beyond the gates of death was but a
hoax, if no substitute be offered?Why point out the fallacies, the
puerile conceptions, the worse than childish thought expressed in the
religious creeds of men, if they were not to be replaced by
life-sustaining truth?If the demolition of cherished beliefs be not
followed by reconstruction upon a sure foundation of demonstrable
truth, then is the resulting state of mind worse than before, for the
trusting, though deceived, soul has no recourse but to fall into the
agnosticism of despair, or the black atheism of positive negation."Happily for me," he sighed, as he closed his books at length, "that
Carmen entered my empty life in time with the truth that she hourly
demonstrates!"CHAPTER 24


Days melted into weeks, and these in turn into months.Simiti, drab
and shabby, a crumbling and abandoned relique of ancient Spanish pride
and arrogance, drowsed undisturbed in the ardent embrace of the
tropical sun.Don Jorge returned, unsuccessful, from his long quest in
the San Lucas mountains, and departed again down the Magdalena river."It is a marvelous country up there," he told Jose."I do not wonder
that it has given rise to legends.I felt myself in a land of
enchantment while I was roaming those quiet mountains.When, after
days of steady traveling, I would chance upon a little group of
natives hidden away in some dense thicket, it seemed to me that they
must be fairies, not real.I came upon the old trail, Padre, the
_Camino Real_, now sunken and overgrown, which the Spaniards used.It used to lead down to Cartagena."Ah, Padre, what quartz veins I saw in that country!Gold
will be discovered there without measure some day!This map which Don Carlos gave me is much in error.Jose regretfully saw
him depart, for he had grown to love this ruggedly honest soul.Meantime, Don Mario sulked in his house; nor during the intervening
year would he hold anything more than the most formal intercourse with
the priest.Events move with
terrible deliberation in these tropic lands, and men's minds are heavy
and lethargic.Jose assumed that Don Mario had failed in the support
upon which he had counted; or else Diego's interest in Carmen was
dormant, perhaps utterly passed.Each succeeding day of quiet
increased his confidence, while he rounded out month after month in
this sequestered vale on the far confines of civilization, and the
girl attained her twelfth year.Moreover, as he noted with marveling,
often incredulous, mental gaze her swift, unhindered progress, the
rapid unfolding of her rich nature, and the increasing development of
a spirituality which seemed to raise her daily farther above the plane
on which he dwelt, he began to regard the uninterrupted culmination of
his plans for her as reasonably assured, if not altogether certain.Juan continued his frequent trips down to Bodega Central as general
messenger and transportation agent for his fellow-townsmen, meanwhile
adoring Carmen from a distance of respectful decorum.Rosendo and
Lazaro, relaxing somewhat their vigilance over the girl, labored
daily on the little _hacienda_ across the lake.The dull-witted
folk, keeping to their dismally pretentious mud houses during the
pulsing heat of day, and singing their weird, moaning laments in the
quiet which reigned over this maculate hollow at night, followed
undeviatingly the monotonous routine of an existence which had no
other aim than the indulgence of the most primitive material wants."Ah, Padre," Rosendo would say of them, "they are so easy!They love
idleness; they like not labor.They fish, they play the guitar, they
gather fruits.Padre, it is sad, is
it not?"Aye, thought the priest, doubly sad in its mute answer to the
heartlessly selfish query of Cain.No one, not even the Church, was
the keeper of these benighted brothers.He alone had constituted
himself their shepherd.And as they learned to love him, to confide
their simple wants and childish hopes to him, he came to realize the
immense ascendency which the priests of Colombia possess over the
simple understanding of the people.An ascendency hereditary and
dominant, capable of utmost good, but expressed in the fettering of
initiative and action, in the suppression of ambition, and the
quenching of every impulse toward independence of thought.How he
longed to lift them up from the drag of their mental encompassment!Yet how helpless he was to afford them the needed lustration of soul
which alone could accomplish it!"I can do little more than try to set them a standard of thought,"
he would muse, as he looked out from the altar over the camellia-like
faces of his adult children when he conducted his simple Sunday
services."I can only strive to point out the better things of
this life--to tell them of the wonders of invention, of art, of
civilization--I can only relate to them tales of romance and
achievement, and beautiful stories--and try to omit in the recital all
reference to the evil methods, aims, and motives which have manifested
in those dark crimes staining the records of history.The world
calls them historical incident and fact.I must call them 'the mist
that went up from the ground and watered the face of the earth.'"But Jose had progressed during his years in Simiti.It had been
hard--only he could know how hard!--to adapt himself to the narrow
environment in which he dwelt.It had been hard to conform to these
odd ways and strange usages.But he now knew that the people's
reserve and shyness at first was due to their natural suspicion of
him.For days, even weeks, he had known that he was being weighed and
watched.It is true, the dull staring of the natives of this unkempt town had
long continued to throw him into fits of prolonged nervousness.They
had not meant to offend, of course.But at hardly any hour of the day or night could he look up
from his work without seeing dark, inquisitive faces peering in
through the latticed window or the open door at him, watchful of the
minutest detail of his activity.And he
had grown used to their thoughtless intrusion upon him at any hour.He
had learned, too, not to pale with nausea when, as was their wont of
many centuries, the dwellers in this uncouth town relentlessly pursued
their custom of expectorating upon his floor immediately they entered
and stood before him.He had accustomed himself to the hourly
intrusion of the scavenger pigs and starving dogs in his house.And he
could now endure without aching nerves the awful singing, the maudlin
wails, the thin, piercing, falsetto howls which rose almost nightly
about him in the sacred name of music.For these were children with
whom he dwelt.And he was trying to show them that they were children
of God.Already Jose had
been obliged to supplement his oral instruction with texts purchased
for her from abroad.Her grasp of the English language was his daily
wonder.After two years of study she spoke it readily.She loved it,
and insisted that her conversations with him should be conducted
wholly in it.French and German likewise had been taken up; and her
knowledge of her own Castilian tongue had been enriched by the few
books which he had been able to secure for her from Spain.Jose's anomalous position in Simiti had ceased to cause him worry.What mattered it, now that he had endeared himself to its people, and
was progressing undisturbed in the training of Carmen?And he, in
turn, knew that upon his observance of them depended his tenure of the
parish.And he wanted to remain among them, to lead them, if possible, at
least a little way along what he was daily seeing to be the only path
out of the corroding beliefs of the human mind.He knew that his
people's growth would be slow--how slow might not his own be, too!Who
could say how unutterably slow would be their united march heavenward!And yet, the human mind was expanding with wonderful rapidity in
these last days.What acceleration had it not acquired since that
distant era of the Old Stone Man, when through a hundred thousand
years of darkness the only observable progress was a little greater
skill in the shaping of his crude flint weapons!To Padre Diego's one or two subsequent curt demands that Carmen be
sent to him, Jose had given no heed.And perhaps Diego, absorbed in
his political activities as the confidential agent of Wenceslas, would
have been content to let his claim upon the child lapse, after many
months of quiet, had not Don Jorge inadvertently set the current of
the man's thought again in her direction.For Don Jorge was making frequent trips along the Magdalena river.It
was essential to his business to visit the various riverine towns and
to mingle freely with all grades of people, that he might run down
rumors or draw from the inhabitants information which might result in
valuable clues anent buried treasure.Returning one day to Simiti from
such a trip, he regaled Jose with the spirited recital of his
experience on a steamboat which had become stranded on a river bar."_Bien_," he concluded, "the old tub at last broke loose.Then we saw
that its engines were out of commission; and so the captain let her
drift down to Banco, where we docked.I was forced, not altogether
against my will, to put up with Padre Diego.But I had much amusement at his expense when I twitted him about his
daughter Carmen, and his silly efforts to get possession of her!"he cried, "why can
you not let sleeping dogs alone?Diego is not the man to be bearded
like that!Would that you had kept away from the subject!And what did
you say to him about the girl?"I only told him how beautiful she was, and how large
for her few years._Bien_, I think I said she was the most beautiful
and well-formed girl I had ever seen.But was there anything wrong in
telling the truth, _amigo_?""No," replied Jose bitterly, as he turned away; "you meant no harm.But, knowing the man's brutal nature, and his assumed claim on the
girl, why could you not have foreseen possible misfortune to her in
dwelling thus on her physical beauty?_Hombre_, it is too bad!""_Na_, _amigo_," said Don Jorge soothingly, "nothing can come of it.But when Don Jorge again set out for
the mountains he left the priest's heart filled with apprehension.A few weeks later came what Jose had been awaiting, another demand
upon him for the girl.Failure to comply with it, said Diego's letter,
meant the placing of the case in the hands of the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities for action.Rosendo's face grew hard when he read the note."There is a way,
Padre.Let my woman take the girl and go up the Boque river to Rosa
Maria, the clearing of Don Nicolas.It is a wild region, where tapirs
and deer roam, and where hardly a man has set foot for centuries.The
people of Boque will keep our secret, and she can remain hidden there
until--"

"No, Rosendo, that will not do," replied Jose, shaking his head in
perplexity."The girl is developing rapidly, and such a course would
result in a mental check that might spell infinite harm.She and Dona
Maria would die to live by themselves up there in that lonely region."Then do you go too, Padre," suggested Rosendo."No, _amigo_, for that would cause search to be instituted by the
Bishop, and we certainly would be discovered.But, to take her
and flee the country--and the Church--how can I yet?He shook his head dolefully, while his thoughts flew
back to Seville and the proud mother there."_Bien_, Padre, let us increase our contributions to Don Wenceslas.Let us send him from now on not less than one hundred _pesos oro_ each
month.Will not that keep him quiet, no matter what Diego says?""At any rate, we will try it."They still
had some three thousand _pesos_ gold left.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre," said Rosendo, some days later, as they sat together in the
parish house, "what do you think Diego wants of the girl?""I think, Rosendo--" he began.But could even a human
mind touch such depths of depravity?And yet--"I think," he continued
slowly, "that Diego, having seen her, and now speculating on her
future beauty of face and form--I think he means to place her in a
convent, with the view of holding her as a ready substitute for the
woman who now lives with him--"

"_Dios_!And, if I mistake not, Diego also would like to
repay the score he has against you, for driving him from Simiti and
holding the threat of death over him these many years.He can most
readily do this by getting Carmen away from you--as he did the other
daughter, is it not so?"His face was strained with
fearful anxiety."Padre," he said in a low voice, "I shall end this
matter at once.I go to Banco to-morrow to kill Diego.""Why--Rosendo, it would mean your own death, or lifelong
imprisonment!""I
have nothing that is not hers, even to my life.Gladly would I give it
for her.Let me die, or spend my remaining days in the prison, if that
will save her.Such a price for her safety would be low."While he was speaking, Fernando, the town constable, entered.He
saluted the men gravely, and drew from his pocket a document to which
was attached the Alcalde's official seal."Senores," he said with much dignity, as if the majesty of his little
office weighed upon him, "I am commanded by Senor, the Alcalde, to
exercise the authority reposing in him and place Don Rosendo Ariza
under arrest.You will at once accompany me to the _carcel_," he
added, going up to the astonished Rosendo and laying a hand upon his
shoulder.cried the old man, stepping
back."_Bien_, _amigo_, I do not find it my duty to tell you.The Senor
Alcalde hands me the document and commands me to execute it.As for
the cause--_Bien_, you must ask him.""Come," said Jose, the first to recover from his astonishment, "let us
go to him at once."He at any rate had now an opportunity to confront
Don Mario and learn what plans the man had been devising these many
months.The Alcalde received the men in his little _patio_, scowling and
menacing.He offered them no greeting when they confronted him."Don Mario," asked Jose in a trembling voice, "why have you put this
indignity upon our friend, Rosendo?"Ask, rather, _Senor Padre_," replied the Alcalde, full of wrath,
"what alone saves you from the same indignity.Only that you are a
priest, _Senor Padre_, _nada mas_!His arrest is ordered by Padre
Diego.""And why, if I may beg the favor?"pursued Jose, though he well knew
the sordid motive.Why lay the hands of the law upon those who deprive a
suffering father of his child!_Bien_, _Fernando_," turning to the
constable, "you have done well.Take your prisoner to the _carcel_.""No, Don Mario, I will not go to
the jail!I will--"

"_Caramba!_" shouted the Alcalde, his face purple."I set your trial
for to-morrow, in the early morning.But this night you will spend in
the jail!_Hombre!_ I will see if I am not Alcalde here!And look you,
_Senor Padre_, if there is any disturbance, I will send for the
government soldiers!Then they will take Rosendo to the prison in
Cartagena!Jose knew that, if Diego had the support of the Bishop, this was no
idle threat."What shall I
do, Padre?""It is best that you go to the jail to-night, Rosendo," said Jose with
sinking heart."But, Don Mario," turning menacingly to the Alcalde,
"mark you, his trial takes place in the morning, and he shall be
judged, not by you alone, but by his fellow-townsmen!""Have I not said so, senor?"returned Don Mario curtly, with a note of
deep contempt in his voice.As in most small Spanish towns, the jail was a rude adobe hut, with no
furnishings, save the wooden stocks into which the feet of the hapless
prisoners were secured.Thus confined, the luckless wight who chanced
to feel the law's heavy hand might sit in a torturing position for
days, cruelly tormented at night by ravenous mosquitoes, and wholly
dependent upon the charity of the townsfolk for his daily rations,
unless he have friends or family to supply his needs.In the present
instance Don Mario took the extra precaution of setting a guard over
his important prisoner.Jose, benumbed by the shock and bewildered by the sudden precipitation
of events, accompanied Rosendo to the jail and mutely watched the
procedure as Fernando secured the old man's bare feet in the rude
stocks.And yet, despite the situation, he could not repress a sense
of the ridiculous, as his thought dwelt momentarily on the little
_opera bouffe_ which these child-like people were so continually
enacting in their attempts at self-government.But it was a play that
at times approached dangerously near to the tragic.The passions of
this Latin offshoot were strong, if their minds were dull and
lethargic, and when aroused were capable of the most despicable, as
well as the most grandly heroic deeds.And in the present instance,
when the fleeting sense of the absurd passed, Jose knew that he was
facing a crisis.Something told him that resistance now would be
useless.True, Rosendo might have opposed arrest with violence, and
perhaps have escaped.But that would have accomplished nothing for
Carmen, the pivot upon which events were turning.Jose had reasoned
that it were better to let the Alcalde play his hand first, in the
small hope that as the cards fell he might more than match his
opponent's strength with his own."_Na_, Padre, do not worry," said Rosendo reassuringly."It is for her
sake; and we shall have to know, as she does, that everything will
come out right.My friends will set me free to-morrow, when the trial
takes place.And then"--he drew the priest down to him and whispered
low--"we will leave Simiti and take to the mountains."Arriving at Rosendo's house, he
saw the little living room crowded with sympathetic friends who had
come to condole with Dona Maria.That placid woman, however, had not
lost in any degree her wonted calm, even though her companions held
forth with much impassioned declamation against the indignity which
had been heaped upon her worthy consort.She was not with her foster-mother, nor did his inquiry reveal her
whereabouts.He smiled sadly, as he thought of her out on the shales,
her customary refuge when storms broke.He started in search of her;
but as he passed through the _plaza_ Manuela Cortez met him."Padre,"
she exclaimed, "is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?""Manuela--why do you say that?"he asked
hurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer."Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her into Don
Mario's house some time ago."Jose uttered an exclamation and started for the house of the Alcalde.Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk denying the priest
admission."Carmen--you have her here?"Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose and came to
his chief's side.Fernando stepped
outside and took his arm.The Alcalde's unlovely face expanded in a
sinister leer."It is permissible to place even a priest in the
stocks, if he becomes _loco_," he said significantly.Fernando spoke quickly:

"It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.But do not
worry; she is safe.""But--you have no right to take her--"

"There, _Senor Padre_, calm yourself.What right had you to separate
her from her father?"And, Don Mario, you have no
authority but his--"

"You mistake, _Senor Padre_," calmly interrupted the Alcalde.he muttered, scarce hearing
his own words."The Bishop's, _Senor Padre_," answered Don Mario, with a cruel grin.But--the old man--"

"_Na_, _Senor Padre_, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.That
is, the new one--"

"The new one!""To be sure, _Senor Padre_, the new Bishop--formerly Senor Don
Wenceslas Ortiz."Jose beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow."_Bien_, _Senor Padre_," put in Fernando gently, pitying the priest's
agony.The old Bishop of Cartagena died suddenly some days ago, and Don
Wenceslas at once received the temporary appointment, until the
vacancy can be permanently filled.There is talk of making Cartagena
an archbishopric, and so a new bishop will not be appointed until that
question is settled.Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers the affairs
of the Church there.""And he--he--" stammered the stunned priest."To be sure, _Senor Padre_," interrupted Don Mario, laughing aloud;
"the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of the beautiful Carmen,
and he cannot permit her to waste her loveliness in so dreary a place
as Simiti.And so he summons her to Cartagena, in care of his agent,
Padre Diego, who awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely
down the river.At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me._Bien_,
it is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!"Jose staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando supported him.But as he went he spitefully hurled
back:

"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_, whom have you to blame but yourself?You keep
a child from her suffering father--you give all your time to her,
neglecting the other poor children of your parish--you send Rosendo
into the mountains to search for La Libertad--you break your
agreement with me, for you long ago said that we should work
together--is it not so?You find gold in the mountains, but you do
not tell me._Na_, you work against me--you oppose my authority as
Alcalde--_Bien_, you opposed even the authority of the good
Bishop--may he rest with the Saints!You have not made a good priest
for Simiti, _Senor Padre_--_na_, you have made a very bad one!And
now you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas takes the girl from you,
to bring her up in the right way.if it is not already too
late to save her from your bad teachings!"His voice steadily rose
while he talked, and ended in a shrill pipe.Jose made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.The Alcalde
got quickly within the house and secured the door."Go now to your
home, Padre," urged Fernando; "else I shall call help and put you in
the stocks, too!"shouted
Jose desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde's door.cried Fernando, holding to the frenzied man."The little Carmen--she is not in there!"Then where is she, Fernando?--for God's sake tell
me!"Great beads of perspiration stood
upon his face, and tears rolled down his drawn cheeks."_Bien_, Padre," he said gently;
"come away.I give you my word that the girl is not in the house of
the Alcalde.But I am not permitted to say where she is.""Then I will search every house in Simiti!""_Na_, Padre, you would not find her.He took Jose's arm again and led him, blindly stumbling, to the parish
house.By this time the little town was agog with excitement.People ran from
house to house, or gathered on the street corners, discussing the
event."_Caramba!_" shrilled one wrinkled beldame, "but Simiti was very quiet
until the _Cura_ came!""_Na_, senora," cried another, "say, rather, until that wicked little
hada was brought here by Rosendo!""_Cierto_, she is an _hada_!"put in a third; "she cured Juanita of
goitre by her charms!I myself saw her come from
the old church on the hill one day!_Bien_, what was she doing?I say,
she was talking with the bad angel which the blessed Virgin has locked
in there!""Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery.She talks with the
buzzards that roost on the old wall, and they are full of evil
spirits!""And she brought the plague two years ago--who knows?"But it was not the real plague, anyway.""_Bueno_, and that proves that she caused it, no?""_Cierto_, _senora_, she cast a spell on the town!"Jose sat in his little house like one in a dream.Dona Maria had gone to the jail to see Rosendo.Juan had
returned that morning to Bodega Central, and Lazaro was at work on the
plantation across the lake.Jose thought bitterly that the time had
been singularly well chosen for the _coup_.Don Mario's last words
burned through his tired brain like live coals.In a sense the Alcalde
was right.He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl.But he alone,
excepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of the girl's real
nature.To the stagnant wits of Simiti she was one of them, but with
singular characteristics which caused the more superstitious and less
intelligent to look upon her as an uncanny creature, possessed of
occult powers.Moreover, Jose had duped Don Mario with assurances of cooeperation.He
had allowed him to believe that Rosendo was searching for La Libertad,
and that he should participate in the discovery, if made.Had his
course been wholly wise, after all?it was all to save an innocent child from the blackest
of fates!If he had been stronger himself, this never could have
happened.Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed himself to be lulled to
sleep by a fancied security bred of those long months of quiet, he
might have been awake and alert to meet the enemy when he returned to
the attack.the devil had left him for a season, and Jose had
laid down "the shield of faith," while he lost himself in the
intellectual content which the study of the new books purchased with
his ancestral gold had afforded.But evil sleeps not; and with a
persistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned with
unbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his guard.*       *       *       *       *

Dawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jose.The Alcalde had sent word
that Fernando must remain with the priest, and that no visits would be
permitted to Rosendo in the jail.Jose had heard nothing from Carmen,
and, though often during the long night he sought to know, as she
would, that God's protection rested upon her; and though he sought
feebly to prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning
found him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing his desolate
heart.Fernando remained mute; and Dona Maria could only learn that
the constable had been seen leading the girl into Don Mario's house
shortly after Rosendo's arrest.At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled for
the trial, which was held in the town hall, a long, empty adobe house
of but a single room, with dirt floor, and a few rough benches.The
Alcalde occupied a broken chair at one end of the room.The trial
itself was of the simplest order: any person might voice his opinion;
and the final verdict was left to the people.In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,
Rosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo, and the manner of
her coming into his family.He told of Diego's appointment to Simiti,
and of the loss of his own daughter.Waxing more and more energetic as
his recital drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and
as worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if ever that
renegade priest should venture near enough for him to lay his hands
upon him.The little locket was produced, and all present commented on
the probable identity of the girl's parents.Many affected to detect a
resemblance to Diego in the blurred photograph of the man.Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of deepest
affection, about the beautiful woman whose love he had won, but whom
his vows of celibacy prevented from making his lawful wife.The
Alcalde's recital was dramatic to a degree, and at its close several
excitedly attempted to address the multitude at the same time.Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by much violent
gesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.At length it was
agreed that Diego had been, in times past, a bad man, but that the
verbal proofs which he had given the Alcalde were undoubtedly valid,
inasmuch as the Bishop stood behind them--and Don Mario assured the
people that they were most certainly vouched for by His Grace.The day
was almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing rhetoric,
painted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under the patronage of
the Bishop.How cruel to retain her in dreary little Simiti, even
though Diego's claim still remained somewhat obscure, when His Grace,
learning of her talents, had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated
in the convent for a glorious future of service to God!Ah, that a
like beautiful career awaited all the children of Simiti!Jose at length forced himself before the people and begged them to
listen to him.But, when he opened his mouth, the words stumbled and
halted.To tell these people that he was
striving to educate the girl away from them was impossible.To say
that he was trying to save her from the Church would be fatal.And to
reiterate that Diego's claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value
to the evidence, for what did he know of the child's parentage?He
feebly begged them to wait until Diego's claim had been either
corroborated or annulled.But no; they had the Bishop's corroboration,
and that sufficed.cried Don Mario, interrupting the
priest in a loud voice, "if we oppose the Bishop, then will he send
the government soldiers to us--and you know what--"

"_Cielo_, yes!"The case now
rested with her God.The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.Don
Mario's beady eyes searched them, until he was certain of the way the
tide was flowing."_Bueno_, _amigos y amigas_," he began with immense dignity; "what say
you if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs have the support of
the Bishop, and show that the girl is the daughter of Padre Diego.Rosendo is guilty of having kept her from her own father, and for that
he should be severely punished.Let him be confined in the jail for
six months, and be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand _pesos
oro_--"

"_Caramba_!but he has no such sum," cried the people with mouths
agape."_Bien_, I say he can get it!"retorted the Alcalde, looking meaningly
at Jose."And he should pay it for depriving the child of a father's
love and the religious instruction which he would have given her!""Will you not remember that more than that amount is due Rosendo for
the care of the child?The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations."_Cierto!_"

"The _Cura_ is right!""Let Rosendo pay no fine--he has no gold, anyway!"The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far."_Bueno_, then," he
amended."We will cancel both the fine and Padre Diego's debt to
Rosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to--what say you all?""A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more," suggested one.An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the protest which
Jose sought vainly to voice.Rosendo rose quickly; but Fernando and
others seized him."_Bien_, it is approved," bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick arms."Take the prisoner to the _carcel_, _Senor Policia_," turning to the
constable."And the girl, Senor the Alcalde--when will you send her to her
father?""Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at once," piped a
woman's shrill voice."_Bien_," shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a long, coarse
laugh, "I was wise enough to know what you would decide, and sent the
girl down the river last night!"CHAPTER 25


The candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful shimmer out
upon the great river, casting huge, spectral shadows across its muddy,
swirling waters, and seeming rather to intensify the blackness that
lay thick and menacing upon its restless bosom.Rivermen who follow
their hazardous calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the
dangers of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment
a false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree, and a
cry through the inky blackness, might sound to the straining ears of
hushed listeners on the distant banks the elements of another of the
mighty river's grim nocturnal tragedies.But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant Simiti a
canoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy shadows along the
river's margin, and poked its blunt nose into the ooze at the upper
edge of the town.Its two scantily clad _bogas_, steaming with
perspiration and flecked with mud from the charged waters, sprang
lightly from the frail craft and quickly made it fast to one of the
long stilts upon which a ramshackle frame house rested.Then they
assisted the third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and
together they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the
town above."_Caramba_, _compadre_!"ejaculated one of the men, stumbling into a
deep rut, "it is well you know where we go.but I travel no
more on the river by night.And, _compadre_, we had best ask Padre
Diego to offer a candle to the Virgin for our safe arrival, no?"Don Diego has much
influence with virgins.""_Bien, amigo_, what would you?You are well paid; and besides, you
score against that baby-faced priest, Jose, who drove you out of
Simiti because you were not married to your woman.You cannot
complain, _compadre_.""_Caramba!_ I have yet to see the color of the _pesos_.I do not much
trust your Padre Diego.""_Na, amigo_, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked gizzard._Cierto_, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory; but you
know we may as well get used to it here, for when we _pobres_ are dead
who will buy Masses to get us out?""_Caramba!_" muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled on through
the darkness, "but if we have no money the priests will let us burn
forever!"The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint, even
when her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in the trail, or were
painfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones and bits of wood that
lay in the narrow path.The man addressed as Julio
assisted her to her feet.The other broke into a torrent of profane
abuse."_Na, Ricardo,_" interrupted Julio, "hold your foolish tongue and let
the girl alone!You and I have cursed all the way from Simiti, but she
has made no complaint._Caramba_, I wish I were well
out of this business!"A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.Then
the men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts and trousers before
entering the town.The road was better here, and they made rapid
progress.The night was far spent, and the streets were deserted.In
the main portion of the town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging
uncertainly in their sconces against old colonial houses, threw a
feeble light into the darkness.Before one of the better of these
houses Julio and the girl were halted by their companion."_Bien_," he said, "it is here that the holy servant of God lives._Caramba_, but may his _garrafon_ be full!"They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.On the floor
above they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo called loudly.A side
door opened and a young woman appeared, holding a lighted candle
aloft."_El Senor Padre, senorita
Ana?_" he said, bowing low."You will do us the favor to announce our
arrival, no?"The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio."The Padre is not
here," she finally said."_Dios y diablo!_" cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy."But we
have risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he not here to
receive and reward us!_Caramba!_"

"But--Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night--he may return at any
moment.She stepped
forward, holding the candle so that its light fell full upon her face.As she did this the girl darted toward her and threw herself into the
woman's arms.she cried, her voice breaking with emotion, "Anita--I am
Carmen!The little Carmen,
my father's--"

"Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo's Carmen--and yours!"Ana clasped the girl in her arms.What brings
you here, of all places?""As you may see, senorita, it is
we who have brought her here, at the command of her father, Padre
Diego."And, since you say he is not in, we must wait until he
returns."Carmen clung to her, while
Ricardo stood looking at them, with a foolish leer on his face.Julio
drew back into the shadow of the wall."_Bien, senorita_," said Ricardo, stepping up to the child and
attempting to take her arm, "we will be held to account for the girl,
and we must not lose her._Caramba!_ For then would the good Padre
damn us forever!"Julio emerged swiftly from the shadow and
laid a restraining hand on Ricardo.The woman tore Carmen from his
grasp and thrust the girl behind herself."_Cierto_, friend Ricardo,
we are all responsible for her," she said quickly."But you are tired
and hungry--is it not so?Let me take you to the _cocina_, where you
will find roast pig and a bit of red rum.""_Caramba!_ my throat is like the ashes
of purgatory!""Come, then," said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by the hand and
leading the way down the steps to the kitchen below.Arriving there,
she lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly set out food and a large
_garrafon_ of Jamaica rum."There, _compadre_, is a part of your reward.And we will now wait
until Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?"While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating their actions
at frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment on their river trip,
the woman cast many anxious glances toward the steps leading to the
floor above.From time to time she replenished Ricardo's glass, and
urged him to drink.Physical exhaustion
and short rations while on the river had prepared him for just what
the woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of the
fiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his scant wit
fading, until at last it deserted him completely, and he sank into a
drunken torpor.Then, motioning to Julio, who had consumed less of the
rum, she seized the senseless Ricardo by the feet, and together they
dragged him out into the _patio_ and threw him under a _platano_
tree."But, senorita--" began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts of Diego's
wrath filtered through his befuddled brain."Not a word, _hombre_!""If you lay a
hand upon this child my knife shall find your heart!""How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?""Three _pesos oro_--and rations," replied the man thickly."Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money."Still retaining Carmen's hand, she mounted the steps, listening
cautiously for the tread of her master.Reaching the rotunda above,
she drew Carmen into the room from which she had emerged before, and,
bidding her conceal herself if Diego should arrive, took her wallet
and hastily descended to where the weaving Julio waited."There, _amigo_," she said hurriedly, handing him the money."Now do
you go--at once!And do not remain in Banco, or Padre Diego will
surely make you trouble.She
pointed to the door; and Julio, impressed with a sense of his danger,
lost no time in making his exit.Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew the girl to
her.she cried, trembling, as her eyes searched the
girl."I do not know, Anita dear," murmured the girl, nestling close to the
woman and twining an arm about her neck; "except that day before
yesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo into the jail--"

"Into the jail!"And then, when I was going to see him, Fernando ran
out of Don Mario's house and told me I must go in and see the Alcalde.Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo were there talking with Don Mario in
the _patio_.Then they threw a _ruana_ over me and carried me out
through the _patio_ and around by the old church to the Boque trail.When we got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea
river, where they put me into a canoe.They paddled fast, down to the
Boque river; then to the Magdalena; and down here to Banco.They did
not stop at all, except when steamboats went by--oh, Anita, I never
saw a steamboat before!But Padre
Jose had often told me about them.And when the big boats passed us
they made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the _ruana_ over me
and told me if I made any noise they would throw me into the river.But I knew if I just kept still and knew--really _knew_--that God
would take care of me, why, He would.And, you see, He did, for He
brought me to you."A tired sigh escaped her lips as she laid her head
on the woman's shoulder."But--oh, _Santa Maria_!"moaned the woman, "you are not safe here!What can I do?--what can I do?""Well, Anita dear, you can know that God is here, can't you?I knew
that all the way down the river.And, oh, I am so glad to see you!Why, just think, it is eight years since you used to play with me!And
now we will go back to Simiti, will we not, Anita?""Pray to the Virgin to help us, child!You may have influence with
her--I have none, for my soul is lost!""Why, Anita dear, that is not true!You and I are both God's children,
and He is right here with us.All we have to do is to know it--just
really _know_ it.""But, tell me, quick--Diego may be here any moment--why did he send
Ricardo for you?""Anita dear, Padre Diego says I am his
child.""Yes--his daughter--that he is my father.But--is it really so,
Anita?""_Madre de Dios!_" cried the woman.He
saw you in Simiti when he was last there--and you are now a
beautiful--No, child, you are not his daughter!The wretch lies--he is
a sink of lies!"Why, no, Anita dear, he is not a beast--we must love him, for he is
God's child, too," said Carmen, patting the woman's wet cheek with her
soft hand."_Carita_, he
is Satan himself!"I don't mean that what you think you see is God's child, Anita dear;
but that what you think you see stands for God's child, and isn't
real.And if we know that, why, we will see the real child of God--the
real man--and not what you call a beast."Carmen
looked about the room."Oh, Anita," she exclaimed, "what a beautiful
place, and what beautiful things you have!"She rubbed the tile floor
with her bare foot."Why, Anita dear, it is just like the palaces
Padre Jose has told me about!"She walked around the room, touching
the various toilet articles on the dresser, passing her hands
carefully over the upholstered chairs, and uttering exclamations of
wonder and delight.The woman looked up with a wan smile."_Chiquita_, they are nothing.They are all cheap trinkets--nothing compared with what there is in
the big world beyond us.You poor dear, you have lived all your life
in miserable little Simiti, and you haven't the slightest idea of what
there is in the world!""But, Anita dear, Simiti is beautiful," the girl protested.You have seen only this poor room, and you think it wonderful.I have
been to Barranquilla and Cartagena with Padre Diego, and have seen
houses a thousand times more beautiful than this.And yet, even those
are nothing to what there is in the world outside."Carmen went to the bed and passed her hand over the white counterpane."Anita--why, is this--is this your--"

"Yes, _chiquita_, it is my bed.You have never seen a real bed, poor
little thing.""But--" the child's eyes were wide with wonder--"it is so soft--you
sink way into it--oh, so soft--like the heron's feathers!I didn't
sleep at all in the canoe--and I am so tired."cried the woman, springing up and clasping the
girl in her arms.When he returns, he may come
right up here!_Santa Maria_, help me!--what shall I do?""Anita--let me sleep in your bed--it is so soft--but--" looking down
dubiously at her muddy feet.The woman's face had set in grim determination.She went to the dresser and took out a small stiletto, which she
quickly concealed in the bosom of her dress."Get right in, just as you
are!I will take care of Diego, if he comes!_Santa Maria_, I will--"

"Anita dear," murmured the girl, sinking down between the white
sheets, "you and I will just _know_ that God is everywhere, and
that He will take care of us, and of Padre Diego too."With a sigh
of contentment the child closed her eyes."Anita dear," she
whispered softly, "wasn't He good to bring me right to you?And
to-morrow we will go back to Simiti--and to padre Rosendo--and Padre
Jose--and--and Cantar-las-horas--you haven't seen him for such a long
time--such a long--long--Anita dear, I--love--you--"

The child dropped asleep, just as a heavy step fell outside the door.Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then went quickly out into
the rotunda.Padre Diego was standing on the top step, puffing and
weaving unsteadily.The woman hurried to him and passed an arm about
his waist.she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation."I feared you
had met with an accident!My heart beats like the patter of rain!Why
do you stay out so late and cause me worry?"The bloated face of the man leered like a Jack-o'-lantern."Spiritual
retreat, my love--spiritual retreat," he muttered thickly."Imbibing
the spirits, you know."The woman gave him a look of inexpressible disgust."But you are home
safe, at any rate," she said in a fawning voice; "and my fear is
quieted.Come now, and I will help you into bed.she
cried, as he lurched toward the door of the room where Carmen lay; "in
your own room to-night!"He swayed to and fro before her, as she stood with her back against
the door."_Nombre de Dios_!"he muttered, "but you grow daily more unkind to
your good Padre!_Bien_, it is well that I have a fresh little
housekeeper coming!"He made again as if to enter the room.The woman
threw her arms about his neck."Padre dear," she appealed, "have you ceased to love your Anita?She
would spend this night alone; and can you not favor her this once?"he croaked in peevish suspicion, "but I think you have a
paramour in there._Bien_, I will go in and shrive his wicked soul!"cried the desperate woman, her hand
stealing to the weapon concealed in her dress."Pepito came this
evening with the case of _Oporto_ which you ordered long ago from
Spain.I put it in your study, for I knew you would want to sample it
the moment you returned."he cried, turning upon her, "why do you not tell me
important things as soon as I arrive?I marvel that you did not wait
until morning to break this piece of heavenly news!_Bien_, come to
the study, and you shall open a bottle for me.but my throat
is seared with Don Antonio's vile rum!My parched soul panteth for the
wine of the gods that flows from sunny Spain!_Caramba_, woman, give
yourself haste!"Suffering himself to be led by her, he staggered across the rotunda
and into the room where long before he had entertained for a brief
hour Don Jorge and the priest Jose.Ana quickly broke the neck of a
bottle of the newly arrived wine and gave him a generous measure.murmured the besotted priest, sinking into a
chair and sipping the beverage; "it is the nectar of Olympus--triple
distilled through tubes of sunlight and perfumed with sweet airs and
the smiles of voluptuous _houris_!Ah, Lord above, you are good to
your little Diego!Another sip, my lovely Ana--and bring me the
cigarettes.And come, fat lass, do you sit beside me and twine your
graceful arms about my neck, while your soft breath kisses my old
cheek!Ah, _Dios_, who would not be human!the good God may
keep His heaven, if He will but give me the earth!"Ana drew his head against her bosom and murmured hypocritical words of
endearment in his ear, while she kept his glass full.Diego babbled
like a child.He nodded; struggled to keep awake; and at length fell
asleep with his head on her shoulder.Then she arose, and, assured
that he would be long in his stupor, extinguished the light and
hurried to her own room.The woman bent over her with the
lighted candle and looked long and wistfully.she
prayed, "if you will but save her, you may do what you will with me!"Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the door and
threw the bolt.Coming back to the bed, she again bent over the
sleeping girl._Dios mio_--and that beast, he has seen her, and he would--ah,
_Dios_!"Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood
rosary.Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside the child."Blessed Virgin," she prayed, while her hot tears fell upon the beads,
"I am lost--lost!Ah, I have not told my beads for many years--I
cannot say them now!_Santa Virgen_, pray for me--pray for me--and if
I kill him to-morrow, tell the blessed Saviour that I did it for the
child!Ah, _Santa Virgen_, how beautiful she is--how pure--what
hair--she is from heaven--_Santa Virgen_, you will protect her?""_Madre de Dios_--she is so beautiful, so
pure--"

Carmen moved slightly, and the woman rose hastily from her knees."Anita dear," murmured the child, "Jesus waked Lazarus--out of
his--sleep.she murmured when Carmen again
slept, "I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an angel!--no, I can
not!She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window and lay
down upon it, drawing a lace _mantilla_ over her face to protect it
from the mosquitoes."_Santa Virgen_", she murmured repeatedly, "pray
the blessed Saviour to protect her to-morrow--pray for her, _Madre de
Dios_--pray for her!"*       *       *       *       *

The piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the woman just as
the first harbingers of dawn spread over the river a crimson flush
that turned it into a stream of blood.Ana bent
over her and left a kiss on her forehead.Then she stole out of the
room and into the study.Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a
monster toad.The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then
hastily descended into the _patio_.Ricardo lay under the _platano_
tree, sleeping heavily."Padre Diego sends
you this money, and bids you go.She held out a roll of _pesos_.The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to his feet."_Caramba, senorita_!""That last
_tragito_--it was a bit too much, no?But--_Bien_, I would see the
good Padre.But, senorita, do me
the great favor to ask the good Padre to see me one little moment.He fumbled in his wallet and drew
out an envelope.He--"

"_Caramba_!"ejaculated the man loudly, as his senses returned."But I
believe there is something wrong here!_Bien_, now I shall see the
Padre!He pushed the woman aside and entered
the house.Ana started after him, and seized his arm.A scuffle ensued, and
Ricardo's voice was loud and shrill as they reached the stairs."Ricardo--anything you ask--double the
amount, if you will go!Leave the house--I will tell the Padre--I will
give him the letter--"

"_Caramba_, but I will see him myself!"shouted the lightheaded
Ricardo."_Bien,
enamorada_, is this the paramour whom you hid in your room last night?_Caramba_, you might have chosen a handsomer one!"Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her hands.Diego
heavily descended the stairs."_Bien_, so it is you!"I do not know, Padre," cried the man excitedly."Senorita Ana, she
made me drunk last night.I brought the girl--I waited for you, but
the senorita--"

"_Caramba_, I understand!"Ana had risen and was making for the stairs.Diego sprang to her and
seized her by the wrist.With her free hand she drew the stiletto from
her bosom and raised it to strike.Ricardo saw the movement, and threw
himself upon her.cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and wrenched the
weapon from her grasp."My pretty angel, you have the venom of a
serpent!did you think to deceive your doting Padre?But--_Dios nos guarde_!"Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now stood at the
head of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the strange scene
being enacted below.Ana lay on the ground, her eyes strained
toward the girl.Ricardo bent over her, awaiting his master's command.He knew now that she had forever lost her power over the priest.Diego
stood like a statue, his eyes riveted upon Carmen.The girl looked
down upon them from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet
without fear.Diego was the first to find his voice.At last you come to your lonely padre!Wait for me, _hermosissima_!"screamed Ana in a
voice of horror.Ricardo clapped his hand heavily over her mouth.he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a thrill
passed through his coarse frame."_Madre de Dios_, but you have grown
beautiful!Don Mario was right--you are surely the most voluptuous
object in human form that has ever crossed my path._Bien_, the
blessed God is still good to his little Diego!"He started away with her, but was detained by the loud voice of
Ricardo."_Bien_, Padre, my pay!""_Cierto, hombre_!"But--a
father's joy--ah!_Bien_, come to me to-morrow--"

"_Na, Senor Padre_, but to-day--now!I have risked my life--and I have
a wife and babes!"_Caramba_, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell!There are more convenient seasons than this for your
business!"And, still holding tightly to the girl's hand, he led her
into the study.The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger."This will cost your life, for you have
put into his dirty hands the soul of an angel, and he will damn it!If you had only taken the money I brought you--"

"Demon-tongue, I will take it now!"He snatched the roll of bills from
her hand and bolted through the door.With a low moan the woman sank
to the ground, while oblivion drew its sable veil across her mind.Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room and then
followed, closing the door after him and throwing the iron bolt.Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon his bulging hips and
gazed long and admiringly at the girl as she waited in expectant
wonder before him.A smile of satisfaction and triumph slowly spread
over his coarse features.Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep
furrows formed into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which
lewdness, debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,
defiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before
him.A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to follow.He
shook his heavy head and passed a hand across his brow, as if to brush
aside the confusion left by the previous night's potations.he muttered, falling heavily into a chair, "but had
I known you were here, little rosebud, I should have tried to keep
sober."He reached out to grasp her; but she eluded him and went
quickly to the open window, where she stood looking down into the
street below.The morning sunlight, streaming into the room, engulfed
her in its golden flood and transmuted the child of earth into a
creature divinely radiant, despite the torn gown and stains of river
travel."_Bien, carisima_," the man wheedled in a small, caressing voice,
"where is your greeting to your glad padre?he muttered,
his eyes roving over her full figure, "but the Virgin herself was
never more lovely!Come, daughter," he purred, extending his arms;
"come to a father's heart that now, praise the Saints!shall ache no
more for its lost darling."The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.What her
glance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of understanding.Then
she drew up a chair that stood near the window, and sinking into it,
buried her face in her hands."_Caramba_, my smile of heaven!chirped Diego,
affecting surprise."Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?Or are
these, perchance, fitting tears of joy?_Bien_, your padre's doting
heart itself weeps that its years of loneliness are at last ended."He
held the sleeve of his gown to his eyes and sniffed affectedly."_Bien_, and what then?""I was just knowing," she answered slowly, "that I was not afraid--that
God was everywhere, even right here--and that He would not let any
harm come to me."and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring father!He again held
out his arms to her."I am not afraid--now," she answered softly."But--I do not think God
will let me come to you.If you were really my father, He would."The man's mouth gaped in astonishment.A fleeting sense of shame
swept through his festering mind.Then the lustful meanness of his
corrupted soul welled up anew, and he laughed brutally.The idea
was delightfully novel; the girl beautifully audacious; the situation
piquantly amusing.He would draw her out to his further enjoyment."So," he observed parenthetically, "I judge you are on quite familiar
terms with God, eh?"The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth.he
commented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking hand the bottle
that stood on the table.Then, filling a glass, "Suppose you thank Him
for sending his little Diego this estimable wine and your own charming
self, eh?Whereat he guffawed loudly and
slapped his bulging sides.The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands.Diego's beady eyes devoured the beautiful creature before him."_Bien_, little Passion flower," he
interrupted, "if you have conveyed to Him my infinite gratitude,
perhaps He will now let you come to me, eh?""I have thanked
Him, Padre--for you and for me," she said; "for you, that you really
are His child, even if you don't know it; and for me that I know He
always hears me.That was what the good man Jesus said, you know, when
he waked Lazarus out of the death-sleep.And so I
kept thanking Him all the way down the river."Diego's eyes bulged as if they would pop from his head, and his mouth
fell open wide, but no sound issued therefrom.The girl went on
quietly:

"I was not afraid on the river, Padre.And I was not afraid to come in
here with you.I knew, just as the good man Jesus did at the tomb of
Lazarus, that God had heard me--He just couldn't be God if He hadn't,
you know.And then I remembered what the good man said about not
resisting evil; for, you know, if we resist evil we make it real--and
we never, _never_ can overcome anything real, can we?So I resisted
evil with good, just as Jesus told us to do.I just _knew_ that God
was everywhere, and that evil was unreal, and had no power at all.And
so the _bogas_ didn't hurt me coming down the river.And you--you will
not either, Padre."Then, very seriously:

"Padre, one reason why I was not afraid to come in here with you was
that I thought God might want to talk to you through me, and I could
help you.The man settled back in his chair and stared stupidly at her.His face
expressed utter consternation, confusion, and total lack of
comprehension.Once he muttered under his breath, "_Caramba_!she is
surely an _hada_!"Absorbed in her
mission, she went on earnestly:

"You know, Padre, we are all channels through which God talks to
people--just like the _asequia_ out there in the street through which
the water flows.We are all channels for divine love--so Padre Jose
says."The priest sat before her like a huge pig, his little eyes blinking
dully, and his great mouth still agape."We are never afraid of real things, Padre, you know; and so I
couldn't be afraid of the real 'you,' for that is a child of God.And
the other 'you' isn't real.But such thoughts are not really ours, you know, for they don't come
from God.But," she laughed softly, "when I saw you coming up the
steps after me this morning--well, lots of fear-thoughts came to
me--why, they just seemed to come pelting down on me like the rain.I turned right on them, just as I've
seen Cucumbra turn on a puppy that was nagging him, and I said, 'Here,
now, I know what you are; I know you don't come from God; and anything
that doesn't come from God isn't really anything at all!'And so they
stopped pelting me.The good man Jesus knew, didn't he?That's why he
said so often, 'Be not afraid.'"Her big eyes sparkled, and her
face glowed with celestial light.Diego raised a heavy arm and,
groping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass of wine."You think that wine makes you happy, don't you, Padre?"she observed,
watching him gulp down the heavy liquor.It just
gives you what Padre Jose calls a false sense of happiness.And when
that false sense passes away--for everything unreal has just _got_ to
pass away--why, then you are more unhappy than you were before.he
ejaculated, "will you rein that runaway tongue!""No, Padre," she replied evenly, "for it is God who is talking to you.You ought to, for you are a priest.You ought to
know Him as well as the good man Jesus did.Padre, can you lay your
hands on the sick babies and cure them?"The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then broke into
another brutal laugh.but we find it easier
to raise new babies than to cure sick ones!do _hadas_ have such voluptuous bodies, such plump legs!_Madre de Dios_, girl, enough of your preaching!"No, Padre," she answered quietly, "I do not want to come to you.But
I want to talk to you--"

"_Dios y diablo_!with a Venus before
me do you think I yearn for a sermon?delay it, delay it--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "you do not see _me._ You are looking only
at your bad thoughts of me."His laugh resembled the snort of an animal."Yes, Padre--and they are _very_ bad thoughts, too--they don't come
from God, and you are _so_ foolish to let them use you the way you do.And you know you see around
you only the thoughts that you have been thinking.Why don't you think
good thoughts, and so see only good things?""Can it be
that I don't see a plump little witch before me, but only my bad
thoughts, eh?_Bien_, then," he
coaxed, "come to your poor, deluded padre and let him learn that you
are only a thing of thought, and not the most enchanting little piece
of flesh that ever caused a Saint to fall!"Her smile had fled, and in its place
sadness and pity were written large upon her wistful face."Come, my little bundle of thought," he coaxed, holding out his fat,
hairy arms."No, Padre," the girl answered firmly."_Na_, then, still afraid, eh?""No, Padre; to be afraid would mean that I didn't understand God."Then come to me and prove that you do understand Him, eh?"Are
you invoking curses on the bald pate of your desolate father?""No, Padre; I am thanking God all the time that He is here, and that
He will not let you hurt me."The man's lust-inflamed eyes narrowed and the expression on his evil
face became more sinister.he growled, "will you come
hither, or must I--"

"No."She shook her head slowly, and her heavy curls glistened in the
sunlight."No, Padre, God will not let me come to you."Panting and cursing softly, the man got slowly to his feet."_Madre de
Dios_!"he muttered; "then we will see if your God will let me come to
you!"Her lips moved rapidly, though no
sound came from them.They were forming the words of the psalmist, "In
God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto
me."It was a verse Jose had taught her long since, when his own heart
was bursting with apprehension.She turned quickly as if to
flee.He thrust out his hand and clutched her dress.The flimsy
calico, frayed and worn, tore its full length, and the gown fell to
the floor.Her white body
glistened in the clear sunlight like a marble statue._"Por el amor de Dios_!"ejaculated the priest, straightening up and
regarding her with dull, blinking eyes.Then, like a tiger pouncing
upon a fawn, he seized the unresisting girl in his arms and staggered
back to his chair.he exclaimed, holding her with one arm about her
waist, and with his free hand clumsily pouring another glass of wine.Bien_, pretty thought,
drink with me this thought of wine!"He laughed boisterously at his
crude wit, and forced the glass between her lips."I--am not afraid--I am not afraid," she whispered, drinking."It
cannot hurt me--nor can you.he panted, setting down the glass and mopping his hot
brow, as he settled back into the chair again."You--do--not--love--me, Padre!""You have--only a wrong thought--of me--of love--of everything!""_Bien_--but you love me, pretty creature, is it not so?"he mocked,
holding up her head and kissing her full on the mouth."I--I love the _real_ 'you'--for that is God's image," she murmured,
struggling to hold her face away from his fetid breath."But--I do
not--love the way that image is--is translated--in your human mind!"he threw himself back and gave noisy vent to his
risibility.For the moment the girl seemed to forget that she was in the fell
clutches of a demon incarnate.Her thought strayed back to little
Simiti, to Cucumbra, to Cantar-las-horas, to--ah, was _he_ searching
for her now?And would he come?--

"It was Padre Jose; he taught me," she whispered sadly.The curse of God blast him, the monkey-faced
_mozo!You have a new master
now to give you a few needed lessons, _senorita mia_, and--"

"Padre Diego!"her tense voice checked further expression of his low
thought.You have no power to
harm me, or to teach me anything!She gasped again as his clutch
tightened about her.He
roughly drew the girl up on his knees."To be sure He will protect
you, my _mariposa._ And He is using me as the channel, you see--just
as you said a few moments ago, eh?"His rude laugh again echoed
through the room."He is not--using you--at all!""Evil thoughts are--are
using you.And all--they can do--is to kill themselves--and you!"Is such a sad fate in store for me, my beautiful
_hada_?"He chuckled and reached out again for the bottle."Another
little thought of wine, my love.I must remember to tell Don Antonio of this!--_Maldita_!"Struggling to save its
contents, he relaxed his hold on Carmen.Like a flash she wormed her
supple body out under his arm, slid to the floor, and gained the
window.shrilled Diego, aflame with
wrath.when I lay these hands again on you--!"Struggling to his feet, he made for the girl.But at the first step
the light rug slid along the smooth tiles beneath his uncertain tread.He threw out an arm and sought to grasp the table.But as he did so,
his foot turned under him.With a
groan the heavy man sank to the floor.For a moment Carmen stood as if dazed.Then the
girl picked up her torn dress and approached him carefully."It was
his bad thoughts," she whispered; "he slipped on them; they threw him!I knew it--I just _knew_ it!"Passing to one side, she gained the door, threw back the bolt, and
hurried out into the rotunda.Crouched on the floor, the stiletto
clasped in her hand, sat Ana, her face drenched with tears, and her
chest heaving.When she saw the girl she sprang to her feet.I could not save you;
I could not break through the heavy door; but I can punish him!"She
burst into a flood of tears and started into the room.cried the girl, throwing herself into the woman's arms.He did not hurt me--God would not let him!she whispered in awed tones,
"did God strike him dead?""I don't know, Anita--but come!clinging to the woman's skirt;
"Anita dear, do not go in there!The woman's eyes were wild, her hair loose and disheveled.she cried, "but we will make sure that the beast is dead before we
go!And if we leave this blade in his heart, it may be a warning to
others of his kind!"Your
murder-thoughts will kill you if you do!Listen--it is a
steamboat whistle!Oh, Anita--if it is going up the river--we can take
it--"

Ana hesitated.He may--"

"Yes, Anita, yes; leave him with God!""Come away, Anita--"

"But where, child?"Why--why, my father would kill me!""No, Anita dear; he loves you; he prays for you; he wants you!It is right--it is just what God has planned, I know!Pin
my dress together, and then hurry!"Mechanically she descended the
stairs and left the house, her hand tightly clasped by Carmen.Dully
she suffered herself to be led hurriedly to the river.A boat,
up-bound, was just docking.The captain stood leaning over the rail
and shouting his commands.murmured the weeping woman, hurrying up the gang
plank with the child.She hastened past the astonished passengers to
the captain and drew him to one side."The child--" she gasped, "Rosendo Ariza's--of Simiti--leave her at
Badillo--they will take her over--"

"Wait, senora," interrupted the captain tenderly."Is it not time for
you to go home, too?"He laid a hand on her shoulder and looked down
into her streaming eyes.And, leading them
down the deck, he opened the door of a vacant cabin and bade them
enter."You can tell me your story when we are under way," he said,
smiling as he closed the door."_Bien_," he muttered, his brow
clouding as he strode off."I have been looking for this for some
time.But--the child--Ariza's--ah, the priest Diego!I think I
see--_Caramba_!A few minutes later the big boat, her two long funnels vomiting
torrents of smoke and sparks, thrust her huge wheel into the thick
waters and, swinging slowly out into mid-stream, turned her flat nose
toward the distant falls of Tequendama.In one of her aft cabins a
woman lay on a cot, weeping hysterically.Over her bent a girl, with a
face such as the masters have sought in vain.The tenderly whispered
words might have been the lingering echo of those voiced in the little
moonlit death-chamber of Cartagena long agone."Anita dear, He is with us, right here.And He says, 'Anita, come!'"CHAPTER 26


"But, Padre dear, why are you so surprised that Padre Diego did not
hurt me?I would have been much more surprised if he had.You are
always so astonished when evil doesn't happen--don't you ever look for
good?Why, I don't ever look for anything else!How could I when I
know that God is everywhere?""The sense of evil--it overwhelms
me at times, _carita_--"

"But, Padre dear, why don't you know right then that it is nothing?If
you did, it would fade away, and only good would overwhelm you."She
nestled closer to the man and clasped her arms more tightly about his
neck."Why, Padre," she resumed, "I was not a bit surprised when
Captain Julio came and told us we were near Bodega Central, and that
he could see you and Juan and Lazaro sitting on the steps of the
inn.""Yes, _chiquita_, we were resting for a moment.If a down-river boat
came by we were going to take it.If not, we expected to go in the
canoe.""Padre dear, what did you intend to do in Banco?""Don't speak of it, child--we--"

"Juan and Lazaro have knives."I?--_chiquita_--"

"Padre dear, God never fights with knives.Anita had a knife; but God
wouldn't let her use it.I don't
know what happened to Padre Diego, except that he fell over his wicked
thoughts.You know, Padre dear, somewhere in the Bible you read to me
that 'With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to
help us, and to fight our battles.'I thought of that when Padre Diego
had his arm around me and held me so tight that I could hardly
breathe.It was only an arm of flesh, after, all, and it couldn't hold
me.""_Bien_, Padre," interrupted Juan, coming up from the boat, "if we are
to reach Simiti to-night we must start at once.""_Bueno_, then let us set out," returned Jose, rising.A muffled sob
reached his ears.He turned to the woman huddled in the shadow of the
door."Come, Ana," he said cheerily; "to-night you will again be home.""No, Padre--I do not go with you.In an instant Carmen's arms were around her."When padre
Rosendo sees us, you and me, why--"

"_Carisima_!"The woman's tears flowed fast while she hugged the girl
to her bosom."No--no--he would drive me from his house!I will get work in the _posada_, perhaps.Or Captain Julio
will take me to Honda on his next trip, and get me a place--"

"Then we must ask him to get a place for us both," interrupted Carmen,
sitting calmly down beside her."And think, Anita, how sad padre
Rosendo will be when he sees the men come back without us!"cried the sorrowing
woman, rising."You don't know what it is--"

"Yes, I do, Anita," returned the girl quickly; "it is nothing--just
zero--and you can't drown it!If it would do any good we would both
jump into the river--that is, if God told us to--wouldn't we?But it
doesn't help any to die, you know, for then we would have it all to do
over again.""Ana," said Jose, laying a hand on the woman's shoulder, "you do not
understand her--neither do I, wholly.But if she tells you to go with
us to Simiti, why, I think I would go.He took her hand and led her, weeping, but no longer resisting, down
to the canoe.Carmen followed, dancing like an animated sunbeam."What
fun, oh, what fun!"she chirped, clapping her hands."And just as soon
as we get home we will go right up to the _carcel_ and let padre
Rosendo out!""_Na, chiquita_," said Jose, shaking his head mournfully; "we have no
power to do that.""Well, then, God has," returned the girl, nothing daunted.Juan pushed the heavily laden canoe from its mooring, and set its
direction toward Simiti.Silence drew over the little group, and the
hours dragged while the boat crept slowly along the margin of the
great river.The sun had passed its meridian when the little craft
turned into the _cano._ To Jose the change brought a most grateful
relief.For, though his long residence in Simiti had somewhat inured
him to the intense heat of this low region, he had not yet learned to
endure it with the careless indifference of the natives.Besides, his
mind was filled with vivid memories of the horrors of his first river
trip.And he knew that every future experience on the water would be
tinged by them.In the shaded _cano_ the sunlight, sifting through the interlocking
branches of ancient palms and _caobas_, mellowed and softened into a
veil of yellow radiance that flecked the little stream with splashes
of gold.Juan in the prow with the pole labored in silence.At times
he stopped just long enough to roll a huge cigar, and to feast his
bright eyes upon the fair girl whom he silently adored.Lazaro, as
_patron_, sat in the stern, saturnine and unimpassioned.The woman,
exhausted by the recent mental strain, dozed throughout the journey.Carmen alone seemed alive to her environment.Every foot of advance
unfolded to her new delights.She sang; she chirped; she mimicked the
parrots; she chattered at the excited monkeys.It was with difficulty
that Jose could restrain her when her sharp eyes caught the glint of
brilliant Passion flowers and orchids of gorgeous hue clinging to the
dripping trees.she exclaimed, "they are in us, you know.We see our thoughts of them--and lots of people wouldn't
see anything beautiful about them at all, just because their thoughts
are not beautiful.Padre, we see--what you said to me once--we see our
interpretations of God's ideas, don't we?That is what I told Padre
Diego.But--well, he will just _have_ to see some day, won't he, Padre
dear?But now let us talk in English; you know, I haven't spoken it
for such a long time."What a rare interpretation of the
mind divine was this child!But he wondered why one so pure and
beautiful should attract a mind so carnal as that of Diego.he mused, "it is again that law.Good always stirs up its
suppositional opposite.And the most abundant good and the greatest
purity stir up the most carnal elements of the human mind.The greater the degree of good, the greater the seeming
degree of evil aroused.The perfect Christ stirred the hatred of a
world.Carmen arouses Diego simply because of her purity.Yet she
knows that he can not harm her."His eyes met the girl's, and she answered his unspoken thought in the
tongue which she was fast adopting."We _have_ to love him, you know,
Padre dear."Oh, not the 'him' that
the human mind looks at, but the real 'him,' you know--the 'him' that
is God's image.And you know there just isn't any other 'him,' now is
there?"murmured Jose, "if I could but keep my thought as
straight as she does!""But, Padre dear, your thought _is_ straight.You know, God's thought
is the only thought there really is.Any other thought has the minus
sign, and so it is zero.If we will always think of the real Padre
Diego, and love that, why, the unreal one will fade away from our
thought.""Do you suppose, _chiquita_, that if we love him we will make him
repent?"The child pondered the question for a moment.Then:

"Padre, what did you tell me once about the word'repent'?""It comes from the Greek word '_metanoia_.'""Yes," she reflected; "but what did you say that--"

"Oh, yes, I told you it meant a complete and radical change of
thought."It was heaven to have this girl before him
and to drink in the naive expressions of her active mind."Padre dear, when John the baptiser said, 'Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand,' did he mean to tell the people that they must have
a complete change of thought?""_Chiquita_," he answered, "I
have no doubt he meant just that.For you have taught me that there
can be no salvation without such a complete and radical change.""No," she said with quick emphasis; "for God is mind, you know.And
His thought is the only real thought there is or can be.The thoughts
of mortals are the opposites of His thoughts, and so they are
illusions, and, like all lies, must pass away.If people want to be
immortal, they must think as God thinks, for He is immortal.They must
stop thinking that there is any power but God.They must stop letting
in thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things
that in English you call 'discord.'God says in the Bible, 'As the
heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts higher than your
thoughts.'And if we want to be
like Him we must think His thoughts."I see, _chiquita_--sometimes very clearly--and
then again I don't see," he said slowly.she insisted, getting up on her knees and facing him.And if you hold this thought always, why, it
will--it will be--"

"Externalized; is that what you are trying to say?"Jesus said, 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so is
he.'""But, Carmen--I-- What you say is doubtless true in essence--but I
think you have not grasped it all--there are so many gaps that your
simple little system of religion does not fill in--so many great
questions that you do not answer.I see, in part--and then, again, I
don't see at all.And when you were stolen away from Simiti I saw
nothing but the evil--and it nearly killed me!"The man had always been an
enigma to her.She could not understand a nature that soared into the
spiritual empyrean one moment, and in the next fell floundering into
the bottomless pit of materialism.The undulating curve which
marked the development of the Rincon mind was to her a thing
incomprehensible."Padre dear," she said at length, a little sadly."When you look at
the first chapter in the Bible and read there how God made everything,
and man in His image, in the image of Mind, you see, and are very
happy.But when you go on to the second chapter and read how the Lord
God--not God, but the _Lord_ God--made a man of dirt, and how this
dirt man listened to his false thoughts and fell, why, then you are
unhappy.Can't you see that
one is a story of the real creation; and the other is the human mind's
interpretation of the creation--an interpretation made according to
the way the human mind thinks the creating _ought_ to have been in
matter?And the second chapter shows how
far the human mind can go--it shows how limited it is.The human mind
couldn't get any farther than that--couldn't make a man out of
anything but dirt.And
so it made a creation of its own.It couldn't understand God; and so
it made a Lord God, just like itself.And if you see, can't you _stick_ to it and _live_ it, until all
the unreal passes away?""I will never cease to try,
_chiquita_," he said."But we were talking about loving Diego, weren't
we?Yes, you are right, we must try to love him, for the good Jesus
said we must love our enemies.""But, if we love everybody, then we haven't any enemies.You can't
love a real enemy--and so there aren't any real ones.We see in other
people only what is in our own thought.If we see evil as real, why,
then we will see bad men and women all around us, for we only look at
our thoughts.But, if we look only at God's thoughts--Padre dear, I
didn't see anything but God's thought when Padre Diego had me in his
arms.I knew it wasn't real, but was just the human way of looking at
things.And I knew that love was the great principle of everything,
and that it just couldn't fail, any more than the principle of algebra
could fail to solve my problems.Well," she concluded with a little
sigh, "it didn't.""Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with your
blundering old Padre Jose.He is groping for the light--"

In an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of upsetting,
the impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap and clasped her
arms about his neck.Juan and Lazaro by a quick and skillful effort
kept the craft upright.she cried, "I didn't mean to say a word that would
make you unhappy--Padre dear, I love you so!Padre, look at your
little girl, and tell her that you love her!"he murmured, "I--I must
not--and--yet--_chiquita_--I adore you!"He buried his face in her
shoulder.Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the priest's arms.Then he suggested that a separation would more evenly balance the
boat.Carmen laughed up at him, but slipped down into the keel and sat
with her head propped against Jose's knees."Padre dear," she said, looking up at him with twinkling eyes, "I
heard Lazaro say a little while before we started that he had lived
many years in Simiti, and that it had always been very quiet until you
came.""_Ay de mi!_" sighed Jose."I can readily believe that the whole world
was quiet until I entered it.""But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.""_Chiquita_," he said, "if ever you go out into it, with
your radical views regarding God and man; and if the stupid old world
will give ear to you, there will be such a shaking up as it has never
experienced since--"

"Padre dear," she interrupted, "I am not going out into the world.I
shall stay in Simiti--with you."He looked down at her, tenderly, wistfully.And then, while her words
still echoed through his mind, a great sigh escaped him.Dusk had closed in upon them when the canoe emerged into the quiet
lake.Huge vampire bats, like demons incarnate, flouted their faces as
they paddled swiftly toward the distant town.Soft evening calls
drifted across the placid waters from the slumbering jungle.Carmen's
rich voice mingled with them; and Juan and Lazaro, catching the
inspiration, broke into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is
heard only among these simple folk.As they neared the town the song
of the _bogas_ changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos; and
when the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Dona Maria and a score of
others were there to welcome the returned travelers.At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd."It is Anita, madre dear," Carmen quickly announced, as she struggled
out of Dona Maria's arms and took the confused Ana by the hand.The light of recognition came into Dona Maria's eyes.Quietly, and
without demonstration, she went to the shrinking woman and, taking the
tear-stained face in her hands, impressed a kiss upon each cheek."_Bien_," she said in a low, tender voice, "we have waited long for
you, daughter.*       *       *       *       *

The glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across the arch of
heaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of Rosendo's house and
demanded the custody of Carmen."And now, Fernando," demanded the priest, "what new outrage is this?""_Na_, Padre, a thousand
pardons--but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I only obey.But--you
may knock me down," he added eagerly, "and then I can return to him
and say that I could not take the girl, even by force!"The honest
fellow, ashamed of his mission, hung his head.he cried, "what say the people of Simiti?"They would demand Rosendo's release, if
there were proof that the girl--"

"Good, then!"Yes, the guard informed him this morning.The Alcalde, you know,
permits no one to approach the prisoner.""And does he know that Ana is here?""The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old man._Hombre!_ I think there is no one in town who would venture to tell
Rosendo that.""_Bien pues_, Fernando, I think the time has come!Go quietly back and
summon every one to a meeting in the town hall at once.Tell them--"

"_Bien_, Padre, I shall know what to tell them.But," anxiously, "Don
Mario has the power to--"

"And we have a greater power," quickly replied the priest, his thought
dwelling on Carmen.An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.Men,
women and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging diverse
views and speculating eagerly on the probable outcome of the meeting.Jose stood before them, with Carmen's hand clasped tightly in his.Don
Mario, purple and trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair,
vainly trying to get the ear of the people.In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the concourse.All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana, as she entered the
room and moved timidly toward Jose.The people fell back to make a
passage for her.Her shoulders were bent, and her face was covered
with a black _mantilla_.Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to address the
multitude.A strong arm from behind
pushed him from the chair.His craven heart began to quake, and he
cast anxious glances toward the single exit.Gently removing the _mantilla_ from the face of the woman, Jose turned
her toward the people.he said in a loud, penetrating
voice, "behold the work of Diego!"He paused for the effect which he knew would be made upon this
impressionable people.Then, when the loud murmur had passed, he drew
Carmen out before him and, pointing to her, said dramatically, "And
shall we also throw this innocent child to the wolf?"Fists were shaken under the Alcalde's
nose, and imprecations were hurled at him from all sides.Don Mario
drew his soiled handkerchief and mopped his steaming brow.Then his
voice broke out in a shriek: "The soldiers--this day I shall summon
them--it is a riot!""_Caramba!_ He speaks truth!"_Caramba!_ Let Diego have his child!""_

"Who says it is not his?"Clasping Jose's arm to steady herself, she had turned to
confront the excited assembly.Then:

"The priest Diego had a child--a girl.Her name--it was--Carmen."_Caramba!_ girl, how know you that?""I know, because I--was--its--mother!"Pandemonium burst upon the room at the woman's words.Don Mario
started for the door, but found his way blocked.he shouted; "and this girl is one of them!""I have lived with him eight
years!I know from his own lips that I speak the truth!"We will write to the President at Bogota!"_Caramba!_ Such an Alcalde!""Let him send for the soldiers, if he wishes to die!"As a unit the fickle people streamed from the room and started for the
jail.Don Mario was borne along on the heaving tide.Jose and Carmen
followed; but Ana fell back and returned to the house of Rosendo.The guard at the jail, seeing the concourse approaching, threw down
his _machete_ and fled.Rosendo's eyes were big with speculation,
though his heart beat apprehensively.The people jammed into the small
hut until it swayed and threatened to collapse."The key to the lock--_Caramba_!Juan quickly produced a long iron bar, and with a few lusty efforts
sprung the stocks.A dozen hands lifted the cramped Rosendo out and
stood him upon his feet.Carmen squirmed through the crowd and threw
herself into his arms.Then, with shouts and gesticulations, a triumphal procession quickly
formed, and the bewildered and limping Rosendo was escorted down the
main street of the town and across the _plaza_ to his home.At the
door of the house Jose turned and, holding up a hand, bade the people
quietly disperse and leave the liberated man to enjoy undisturbed the
sacred reunion with his family.With a parting shout, the people
melted quickly away, and quiet soon reigned again over the ancient
town."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, pausing before his door to clasp anew
the priest's hand, "you have not told me what has caused this.Was it
the little Carmen--"

He stopped short.Glancing in at the door, his eyes had fallen upon
Ana.To Jose, hours seemed suddenly compressed into that tense
moment.Slowly Rosendo entered the house and advanced to the shrinking woman.Terror spread over her face, and she clutched her throat as the big
man stalked toward her.Then, like a flash, Carmen darted in front of
her and faced Rosendo."It is Anita, padre dear," she said, looking up into his set face, and
clasping his hand in both of hers."_Bien_, outcast, is your lover with you, that I may strangle him,
too?"cried Carmen, putting both her hands against him.snarled the angry man, still addressing the cowering
woman."Did you tire of him, that you now sneak home?as Ana rose and stood before him, "you come here that your illegal
brat may be born!he shouted, raising his clenched
fist as if to strike her.Carmen turned swiftly and threw herself upon the woman.Looking over
her shoulder, she addressed the raging man:

"Padre Rosendo!He only lets you
have it, because He is good to you!Shame on you, for daring to drive
Anita away--your own little girl!"Her voice rose shrill, and her
words cut deep into the old man's embittered heart."Shame on you, padre Rosendo!""If
God were like you He would drive you from the house, too!Are you so
much better than the good Jesus that you can drive away a woman who
sins?Are you better than the good father who was
so glad to see his prodigal son?If God were to punish you for your
sins, would He even let you live?Did He not set you free this very
morning?And do you now thank Him by driving your little girl from her
own home?Do you know that it was Anita who made you free, and who
brought me here?And is this the way you
thank Him?Then you will lose us both, for we will not stay with
you!"Jose stepped up and took Rosendo's arm.Carmen turned about and
continued her scoriation:

"Padre Rosendo, if the good, pure God was willing to use Anita to save
me from Padre Diego and bring me back to you, are you so wicked and so
ungrateful that you throw His love back in His face?"_Caramba!_" cried Rosendo, tears bursting from his eyes."She has
fouled my name--it was a good name, though my parents were slaves--it
was a good name--and she blackened it--she--"

"Padre Rosendo, there are only two names that have never been
blackened!Your human name is nothing--it is zero--it counts for
foolishness with God!You yourself are making your name blacker now
than Anita ever did!She repents, and comes to her father; and he is
so much more wicked than she that he drives her out!--"

"Enough, Carmen, child!""Come, Rosendo; go into the
parish house!Then a smile lighted up her face, and she reached up
and took Rosendo's hand.Together they passed silently out and into
the priest's house.Ana sank to the floor, where she buried her face in her hands and wept
violently."Wait, Ana," said Jose, tenderly stroking the unhappy woman's hair.And you shall remain here, where you
belong."Then Jose, wondering, went quietly to the door of
his house and looked in.Rosendo sat at the table, with Carmen on his
knees."And, padre," the child was saying, "the good Jesus told the woman not
to sin any more; and she went away happy.Padre, God has told Anita
not to sin any more--and she has come to us to be happy.We are going
to make her so, aren't we?Padre Diego couldn't hurt me, you know, for
God wouldn't let him.And he hasn't hurt Anita--God wouldn't let him
keep her--wouldn't let her stay with him.And we
have got to be like Him--we _are_ like Him, really.But now we have
got to show it, to prove it, you know."Rosendo's head was bent over the girl.The
child went on with increased animation:

"And, padre dear, God sends us Anita's little baby for us to love and
protect.Oh, padre, if the little one is a boy, can't we call it
Jose?""Yes, _chiquita_," Jose heard the old man murmur brokenly."And--padre, if it is a girl--what shall we call it?""We--we will call it--Carmencita,"
he whispered."Can't you see, padre, that God sends us
Anita's baby so that Padre Diego shall not have it?And now let's go
and tell her so, right away!"Jose slipped quickly back and stood beside the woman when Carmen and
Rosendo entered the room.The old man went directly to his daughter,
and, taking her in his brawny arms, raised her from the floor and
strained her to his breast.Tears streamed down his swart cheeks, and
the words he would utter choked and hung in his throat."Padre," whispered the delighted child, "shall I tell her our names
for the baby?"Divine Love was there, and
its dazzling effulgence blinded him.In the quiet of his own chamber
he sought to understand the marvelous goodness of God to them that
serve Him.CHAPTER 27


The reversal of a life-current is not always effected suddenly, nor
amid the din of stirring events, nor yet in an environment that we
ourselves might choose as an appropriate setting.It comes in the
fullness of time, and amid such scenes as the human mind which
undergoes the transformation may see externalized within its own
consciousness by the working of the as yet dimly perceived laws of
thought.Perhaps some one, skilled in the discernment of mental laws and their
subtle, irresistible working, might have predicted the fate which
overtook the man Jose, the fulsome details of which are herein being
recounted.Perhaps such a one might say in retrospect that the
culmination of years of wrong thinking, of false beliefs closely
cherished, of attachment to fear, to doubt, and to wrong concepts of
God, had been externalized at length in eddying the man upon this far
verge of civilization, still clinging feebly to the tattered fragments
of a blasted life.But it would have been a skilled prognostician,
indeed, who could have foreseen the renewal of this wasted life in
that of the young girl, to whom during the past four years Jose de
Rincon had been transferring his own unrealized hopes and his vast
learning, but without the dross of inherited or attached beliefs, and
without taint of his native vacillation and indecision of mind.For what he had been striving to fit her, he knew not.But in a
vaguely outlined way he knew that he was being used as a tool to shape
in some degree the mental development of this strange girl.Nor,
indeed, as the years passed, did she continue to seem so strange to
him.On the contrary, he now thought it more marvelous by far that the
world, after nineteen centuries of Christianity, did not think and act
more as did this girl, whose religious instruction he knew to have
been garnered at the invisible hand of God.That she must some day
leave him, despite her present earnest protestations, he felt to be
inevitable.And the thought pierced his soul like a lance.But he
could not be certain that with maturity she would wish to remain
always in the primitive environment in which she had been nurtured.Nor could he, even if she were willing, immolate her upon the barb of
his own selfishness.As for himself, the years had but seemed to increase the conviction
that he could never leave the Church, despite his anomalous position
and despite his renewed life--unless, indeed, she herself cast him
forth.Each tenderly hopeful letter from his proud, doting mother only
added to this conviction by emphasizing the obstacles opposing such a
course.Her declining years were now spent among the mental pictures
which she hourly drew upon the canvas of her imagination, pictures in
which her beloved son, chastened and purified, had at length come into
the preferment which had always awaited loyal scions of the house of
Rincon.Hourly she saw the day draw nearer when he should be restored
to her yearning arms.Each dawn threw its first rays upon his
portrait, which hung where her waking eyes might open upon it.Each
night the shadow cast by the candle which always burned beneath it
seemed to her eager sight to crown that fair head with a bishop's
mitre--a cardinal's hat--aye, at times she even saw the triple crown
of the Vicar of Christ resting upon those raven locks.If her own pen did not always correctly delineate her towering hopes,
his astute uncle did not fail to fill in whatever hiatus remained.And
the pressure of filial devotion and pride of race at times completely
smothered within him the voice of Truth which Carmen continually
sounded, and made him resolve often that on the day when she should
leave him he would bury his head in the lap of Mother Church and
submit without further resistance to the sable veil of assumed
authority which he knew she would draw across his mind.Convincing as
were the proofs which had come to him of the existence of a great
demonstrable principle which the Christ had sought to make a dull
world recognize, nevertheless he had as yet failed to rise permanently
above the mesmerism of human belief, which whispered into his
straining ears that he must not strive to progress beyond his
understanding, lest, in the attempt to gain too rapidly, he lose all.To sink into the arms of Mother Church and await the orderly
revelation of Truth were less dangerous now than a precipitate
severance of all ties and a launching forth into strange seas with an
untried compass.True, they
reasoned, he had seemed to see the working of mental law in his own
restoration to health when he had first come to Simiti.He had seemed
to see Rosendo likewise restored.But these instances, after all,
might have been casual.That Carmen had had aught to do with them, no
one could positively affirm.True, he had seen her protected in
certain unmistakable ways.But--others were likewise protected, even
where there had been no thought of an immanent, sheltering God.True,
the incident of the epidemic in Simiti two years before had impressed
upon him the serious consequences of fear, and the blighting results
of false belief.But he could not hope
suddenly to empty his mentality of its content of human thought; nor
did wisdom advise the attempt.He had at first tried to rise too
rapidly.His frequent backsliding frightened and warned him.Thus, while the days sped by, did the priest's thought ebb and flow.As morn broke, and the gallant sun drove the cowardly shadows of night
across the hills, his own courage rose, and he saw in Carmen the pure
reflection of the Mind which was in Christ Jesus.As night fell, and
darkness slunk back again and held the field, so returned the legion
of fears and doubts that battled for his soul.Back and forth in the
arena of his consciousness strove the combatants, while he rushed
irresolutely to and fro, now bearing the banner of the powers of
light, now waving aloft, though with sinking heart, the black flag of
the carnal host.For a while after his arrival in Simiti he had seemed
to rise rapidly into the consciousness of good as all-in-all.But the
strain which had been constantly upon him had prevented the full
recognition of all that Carmen saw, and each rise was followed by a
fall that left him for long periods immersed in despair.Following the return of Carmen and the ripple of excitement which her
abduction had spread over the wonted calm of Simiti, the old town
settled back again into its accustomed lethargy, and Jose and the girl
resumed their interrupted work.From Ana it was learned that Diego had
not voiced the command of Wenceslas in demanding the girl; and when
this became known the people rose in a body to her support.Don Mario,
though he threatened loudly, knew in his heart he was beaten.He knew,
likewise, that any further hostile move on his part would result in a
demand by the people for his removal from office.He therefore retired
sulking to the seclusion of his _patio_, where he sat down patiently
to await the turn of events.Rosendo, his great heart softened toward his erring daughter, again
rejoiced in the reunion of his broken family circle.But his soul
burned within him as, day after day, he saw Ana move silently about
like a sorrow incarnate.At times, when perchance he would come upon
her huddled in a corner and weeping quietly, he would turn away,
cursing deeply and swearing fulsome vengeance upon the lecherous beast
who had wrought her ruin."Padre," he one day said to Jose, "I shall kill him--I know it.The
girl's suffering is breaking my heart.He is like an evil cloud
hanging always over my family.I hate him, as the devil
hates the light!And Jose offered
no remonstrance, for the case lay not in his hands.Carmen again entered upon her interrupted studies with ardent
enthusiasm.And her first demand was that she be allowed to plunge
into a searching study of the Bible."Padre," she exclaimed, "it is a
wonderful book!Why--do the people in the world know what a book this
is?For if they did, they would never be sick or unhappy again!"Here it is--the
whole thing!'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his _thoughts_.'But--don't the people know what that means?""Well, _chiquita_, and what does it mean?""Why--the unrighteous man is the man who thinks wrong thoughts--thoughts
of power opposed to God--thoughts of sin, of sickness, of accidents,
and all sorts of evil things--beliefs that these things are real, and
that God made or caused them!""_Bien_, and you think the Bible speaks truth?"Why, it says right here that it is given
by inspiration!That means that the men or women who wrote it thought
God's thoughts!""No, but that those who wrote it were--well, were cleaner window-panes
than other people--that they were so clean that the light shone
through them better than it did through others.""And what do you think now about Jesus?""Why, as you once said, that he was the very cleanest window-pane of
all!"From that hour the Bible was the girl's constant companion.Daily she
pored over it, delighted, enraptured.Jose marveled at her immediate
spiritual grasp.Instead of the world's manner of looking upon it as
only a collection of beautiful promises and admonitions, she saw
within it the statement of a principle that offered itself as a mighty
tool with which to work out humanity's every-day problems here and
now.From the first she began to make out little lists of collated
scriptural verses, so arranging them that she could read in them a
complete expression of an idea of God.These she would bring to Jose
and, perching herself upon his lap, would expound them, to her own
great delight and the wonder of the man who listened."See, Padre," she said, holding up one of these lists, "it says that
'in that day' whatever we ask of him will be given to us.Well, 'that
day' means when we have washed our window-panes clean, and the light
shines through so clear that we can ask in His name.It means when we
have stopped saying that two and two are seven.""Which means," Jose interpolated, "asking in his character.""Yes," she replied, "for then we will be just like him.And then
whatever we ask 'believing' will be given to us, for believing'
will then be 'understanding,' will it not?When we know--really
_know_--that we have things, why--why, we have them, that's all!"She did not wait for his reply, but went on enthusiastically:

"You know, Padre, in order to be like him we have got to'seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness'--His right-thinking.Well,
Jesus said the kingdom of God was within us.Of course it is, for it
is all a question of right-thinking.When we think right, then our
right thoughts will be--what you said--"

"Externalized," he supplied.We will see them all around us, instead of seeing, as we do now,
a lot of jumbled-up thoughts of good and evil which we call people and
things.And then will be the time when
'God shall wipe away all tears.'It is, as you say in English, 'up to
us' to bring this about.It is not for God to do it at all.Don't you
see that He has already done His part?He has made everything, and
'behold it was very good.'Well, He doesn't have to do it all over
again, does He?But we have got to wash our windows clean and let
in the light that comes from Him.That light comes from Him all the
time, just as the beams come from the sun, without ever stopping.We
never have to ask the sun to shine, do we?And neither do we have to
ask God to be good to us, nor tell Him what we think He ought to do
for us.We only have to _know_ that He is good, to us and to
everything, all the time.""Yes, _chiquita_, we must be truly baptised.""That is what it means to be baptised, Padre--just washing our
window-panes so clean that the light will come in.""And that light, little one, is truth.It certainly is a new way of
looking at it, at least, _chiquita_.""But, Padre, it is the _only_ way," she persisted."_Bien_, I would not say that you were mistaken, Carmen.""No, Padre, for we can prove it.And, look here," she continued,
referring to her list."If the kingdom of heaven is within us, then
everything that comes to us in life comes from within, and not from
without.And so, things never happen, do they?"I see," he replied seriously, "that from the mouths of babes and
sucklings comes infinite wisdom.""Well, Padre dear, wisdom is God's light, and it comes through any one
who is clean.It doesn't make any difference how old or young that
person is."How can you say that, _chiquita_?""Why, Padre, is God old?""Well, the unreal 'we' is already zero.Didn't you yourself say that
the human, mortal man was a product of false thought, thought that was
the opposite of God's thought, and so no thought at all?Didn't you
say that such thought was illusion--the lie about God and what He has
made?Then isn't the human 'we' zero?""Well--but--_chiquita_, it is often hard for me to see anything but
this sort of 'we,'" returned the man dejectedly.she entreated, "why will you not try to look at something
else than the human man?Look at God's man, the image of infinite
mind.You have _got_ to do it, you know, some time.He
said that every man would have to overcome.That means turning away
from the thoughts that are externalized as sin and sickness and evil,
and looking only at God's thoughts--and, what is more, _sticking to
them_!""Yes," dubiously, "I suppose we must some time overcome every belief
in anything opposed to God.""Well, but need that make you unhappy?It is just because you still
cling to the belief that there is other power than God that you get so
discouraged and mixed up.Why, I would try
it even if a whole mountain fell on me!"And Jose could but clasp the earnest girl in his arms and vow that he
would try again as never before.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Jose and his little student-teacher were delving into
the inexhaustible treasury of the Word; while the peaceful days came
into their lives and went out again almost unperceived, the priest
Diego left the bed upon which he had been stretched for many weeks,
and hobbled painfully about upon his scarcely mended ankle.While a
prisoner upon his couch his days had been filled with torture.Try as
he might, he could not beat down the vision which constantly rose
before him, that of the beautiful girl who had been all but his.He
cursed; he raved; he vowed the foulest vengeance.And then he cried
piteously, as he lay chained to his bed--cried for something that
seemed to take human shape in her.He protested that he loved her;
that he adored her; that without her he was but a blasted cedar.Only Don
Antonio was found low enough in thought to withstand the flow of foul
language which issued from the baffled Diego's thick lips while he
moved about in attendance upon the unhappy priest's needs.Then came from the acting-Bishop, Wenceslas, a mandate commissioning
Diego upon a religio-political mission to the interior city of
Medellin.The now recovered priest smiled grimly when he read it."Prepare yourself, _amigo_," he said, "for a work of the Lord.You accompany me as far as Badillo, where we
disembark for stinking Simiti.And, _amigo_, do you secure a
trustworthy companion.Meantime, my blessing
and absolution."Then he sat down and despatched a long letter to Don Mario.CHAPTER 28


"Rosendo," said Jose one morning shortly thereafter, as the old man
entered the parish house for a little chat, "a Decree has been issued
recently by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office whereby,
instead of the cloth scapulary which you are wearing, a medal may be
substituted."_Cierto_, Padre--but," he hesitated, "is the new one just as--"

"To be sure, _amigo_.But I
have arranged it to wear about the neck."Rosendo knelt reverently and crossed himself while Jose hung the new
scapulary over his head."_Caramba!_" he
exclaimed, rising, "but I believe this one will keep off more devils
than that old cloth thing you made for me!"admonished Jose, repressing a smile, "did I not bless
that one before the altar?""_Cierto_, Padre, and I beg a thousand pardons.It was the blessing,
wasn't it?But this one," regarding it reverently,
"this one--"

"Oh, yes, this one," put in Jose, "carries the blessing of His Grace,
acting-Bishop Wenceslas.""And a Bishop is always very holy, is he not, Padre?""It makes no difference who he is, for the office makes him holy, is
it not so, Padre?""Oh, without doubt," returned Jose, his thought reverting to the
little Maria and the babe which for four years he had been supporting
in distant Cartagena."_Na_, Padre," remonstrated Rosendo, catching the insinuation, "we
must not speak ill of the Bishop, lest he be a Saint to-morrow!But,
Padre," he went on, changing the topic, "I came to tell you that Don
Luis has given me a contract to cut wood for him on the island._Hombre!_ I shall earn much money by its terms.I set
out to-morrow morning before daybreak."The man's words aroused within him a faint suspicion.Don Luis and the Alcalde were boon companions.Jose wondered if in
this commission he could see the gloved hand of Don Mario.But he gave
no hint of his thought to Rosendo.The next morning, long before sun-up, a mist lay thick over the
valley, so thick that Rosendo, as he made his way down to the lake,
scarce could distinguish the road ahead of him.The dry season had
passed, and the rains were now setting in.As he hurried along, the
old man mused dubiously on the contract which Don Luis had made with
him.To cut wood in the rainy season!--but, after all, that was no
concern of his.And yet--why had Padre Jose grown suddenly quiet when
he learned of the contract yesterday?His bare feet fell softly upon
the shales, and he proceeded more cautiously as he neared the water's
edge."_Hombre!_" he muttered, striving to penetrate the mist; "only a
_loco_ ventures out on the lake in such weather!"He reached the boat, and placed in it the rope and axe which he had
brought.Then, still troubled in thought, he sat down on the edge of
the canoe and dropped into a puzzled meditation.But fishermen do not go out on the lake in dense
fogs, he remembered.Then through the mist loomed the thick body of a man.Straining his
eyes, Rosendo recognized Padre Diego.With a bound the old man was upon his feet.His thick arm shot out
like a catapult; and his great fist, meeting Diego squarely upon the
temple, felled him like an ox.For a moment Rosendo stood over the prostrate priest, like a lion
above its prey.Then he reached into the canoe and drew out the axe.Holding it aloft, he stood an instant poised above the senseless man;
then with a mighty swing he whirled about and hurled it far out into
the lake.Incoherent
muttering issued from his trembling lips.He looked about in
bewilderment.He took the rope from
the boat and quickly bound Diego hand and foot.This done, he picked
up the unconscious priest and tossed him into the canoe as if he had
been a billet of wood.Jumping in after him, he hastily pushed off
from the shore and paddled vigorously in the direction of the island.Why he was doing this he had not the faintest idea.It was all the work of a few seconds; yet when his reason came again
Rosendo found himself far out in the thick fog, and his prisoner
moaning softly as consciousness slowly returned.The sense of
direction which these sons of the jungle possess is almost infallible,
and despite the watery cloud which enveloped him, the old man held his
course undeviatingly toward the distant isle, into the low, muddy
shore of which his boat at length forced its way under the impulse of
his great arms.The island, a low patch a few acres in extent, lay far out in the lake
like a splotch of green paint on a plate of glass.Its densely wooded
surface, rising soft and oozy only a few feet above the water, was
destitute of human habitation, but afforded a paradise for swarms of
crawling and flying creatures, which now scattered in alarm at the
approach of these early visitors coming so unexpectedly out of the
heavy fog.When the canoe grounded, Rosendo sprang out and pulled it well up into
the mud.Then he lifted the priest out and staggered into the thick
brush, where he threw his burden heavily upon the ground.Leaving his
prisoner for a moment, he seized his _machete_ and began to cut back
into the brush.Returning
to the now conscious Diego, he grasped the rope which bound him and
dragged him along the newly opened trail into a little clearing which
lay beyond.There he propped him up against a huge cedar.As he did
this, Diego's mouth opened wide and a piercing scream issued.The cry echoed dismally across the desolate island.In an instant
Rosendo was upon him, with his knife clutched in his fist."Repeat
that, _cayman_," he cried furiously, "and this finds your wicked
heart!"The craven Diego shook with fear; but he fell silent before the threat
of the desperate man into whose hands he had so unwittingly fallen.Rosendo stepped back and stood before his captive, regarding him
uncertainly.Diego's quick intuition did not fail to read the old
man's perplexity; and his own hope revived accordingly.It was a
pretty trick, this of Rosendo's--but, after all, he would not dare too
much.He even smiled unctuously
at his captor."_Bien, amigo_," he said at length, "is this your customary reception
to visitors in your village?_Caramba!_ but what will the good Bishop
say when he learns that you have thus mistreated his trusted agent?"His thought was confused, and
it moved slowly.In the cries of the disturbed birds he seemed now to
hear the warning voice of Carmen.In the watery vapor that rolled over
him he seemed to feel the touch of her soft, restraining hand."_Bien, compadre_," purred Diego, "would it not be well for you to
loosen this bit of thread, that we may make our way back to the
village?_Caramba!_ but it cuts sore--and I am soft, my friend, for I
have been ill.""What made you ill, _cayman_?"he
shouted, drawing nearer to the shrinking Diego and shaking a great
fist in his face._Caramba!_ I would that
your illness had carried you off and saved me the task of sending you
down to purgatory!""But--Rosendo--_caro amigo_,
let us reason together!Ah, _compadre_--loosen but a little this rope
which cuts into my tender skin as your bitter words do into my soul!""_Na_, vulture, but you will drown more quickly thus!"retorted
Rosendo, his huge frame trembling with agitation.But the man before him was an ignorant _peon_.It was not the first time that he had set his own wit against
another's brute strength.The ever-present memory of the girl
became more vivid."You see only your thoughts of me--and they are very bad!"Was he
seeing now only his own bad thoughts?But she had said they were
unreal.And this episode--_Hombre!_ he would not be afraid.His
thought was vastly more powerful than that of a simple _peon_!"But, _amigo_," he resumed gently, "if you had wished to drown me, why
did you bring me here?But--ah, well, I have long been prepared to go.I have been sadly misunderstood--disbelieved--persecuted!Ah, friend
Rosendo, if you could know what I do--but--_Bien_, it is of no
consequence now.Come, then, good fellow, despatch me quickly!Diego ceased talking and began to murmur
prayers.The wind was being taken from his
sails.Diego noted the effect, and resumed his speech.His voice was
low and soft, and at times great tears rolled down his cheeks."Rosendo, friend, I wish to go.And yet, I grieve that you must tarnish yours with my
blood.But," his eyes brightening and his tone becoming more
animated, "Rosendo, I will pray the blessed Virgin for you.When I am
with her in paradise I will ask her to beg the gentle Saviour to
forgive you._Bien_, good friend, we shall all be together in heaven
some day."He started his orisons again, and soon was praying like a
locomotive: "_Ora pro nobis!Santa Maria, ora pro nobis!_"

He stopped and sighed gently."Rosendo--I must say this before I die--I came to Simiti to see you.I
was approaching the boat to hold converse with you.But, you struck
me--there, _que importa_!And yet--it was about the gentle Ana, your
beautiful daughter--But, wait, Rosendo--God above!hear me through--"

Rosendo had started again toward him."Good friend, hear me first, then kill me quickly, for I much desire
to go to my home above!"The impression must be
made upon Rosendo at once, or all was lost.The wily priest knew the
_peon_ mind."_Bien_, good friend, you have misunderstood me.I--Rosendo--I--you will keep my secret, will you not?Bien, I have
left the Church.It was for good reasons that
God took me from the priesthood for other work in His field._Bien_,
the bonds of celibacy removed, behold!my first thought is for my
beautiful Ana.I would render
legitimate her unborn child.I would return to her the peace which she
lost when we became so deeply enamored of each other.Rosendo, I have
come to Simiti to lay my life before you--to yield it to the mother of
my child--to offer it in future service as a recompense for the
unhappiness which, the Virgin knows, I did not willingly bring upon
her, or you!"Rosendo's head was now in a whirl.His eyes protruded, and his mouth
was agape."But--the little Carmen--" he muttered.friend," said Diego sadly, shaking his head, while he quickly
grasped the cue, "I have ceased my endeavors to make you believe that
she is my child._Caramba!_ I can only leave it to the blessed Virgin
to restore her to me when we have both passed the portals of death.""_Caro amigo_," returned Diego gently, "in these last moments I see in
her the beautiful image of her blessed mother, who was taken from me
long before I met and loved your Ana.I await now the reunion which death alone can effect.Drown me not, I pray you,
but rather open an artery and let me fall gently asleep here beneath
this noble tree."A light came into Rosendo's troubled eyes.A cunning smile lurked
about his mouth."_Bien pues_, it shall be as you wish, vulture," he replied in a tone
which again struck terror to Diego's heart.He drew his knife and
approached the horrified priest."_Caramba!_" shrieked Diego, shrinking back against the tree."_Hombre!_ you do not intend--"

"Why not, vampire?"returned Rosendo, the sardonic smile spreading
across his grim features.But would
you go down to hell with murder on your soul?""_Cierto_, carrion!But you go down with a load of
murdered souls!""Rosendo--God!--it means hell for eternity to you!""To be sure, dog-meat," calmly replied Rosendo."But hell will be
heaven to me as I sit forever and hourly remind you of the suffering
Ana and the beautiful Carmen, whom you tried to ruin!Wild thoughts flashed through
his mind with lightning speed.A last
expedient came to him.He fixed his beady eyes upon Rosendo and
muttered: "Coward!you bind a sick man and stick him like a
pig!""We give a deer, a tapir, a jaguar, a chance for its life.But you--coward, you are afraid of a sick man!"_Caramba!_" he cried, "what
would you?"He leaped to the sitting man and at a stroke severed his
bonds."_Bien_, spew of the vampire!Diego extended his empty hands, palms up."_Caramba!_ take the knife!_Hombre!_ but I will kill you with my bare
hands!"He threw the long knife to Diego, who stooped and picked it
up.Stepping quickly back, holding the weapon firmly clenched before him,
the priest slowly circled Rosendo, as if looking for an opening.An
evil smile played constantly over his heavy face, and his little eyes
glittered like diamonds.Rosendo stood like a rock, his long arms
hanging at his side.Then, with a shrill, taunting laugh, Diego turned suddenly and
plunged into the newly-cut trail toward the lake.In an instant he was
lost in the fog.For a moment Rosendo stood dumb with amazement.Diego had reached the canoe, leaped
quickly in, and pushed off.He was
left a prisoner, without a boat, and with two miles of shrouded water
stretching between him and the town!He had been tricked, outwitted; and the
evil genius which for years had menaced his happiness was heading
straight toward the town, where his accomplice, Ricardo, awaited.What
would they do, now that he was out of the way?Great beads of water, distilled from his agony, burst through
his pores.The Juncal river lay off to the west, and at a much less
distance than Simiti.He might swim to it and secure a canoe at the
village.But--the lake was alive with crocodiles!Chagrin and apprehension overwhelmed him, and he burst into a flood of
bitter tears.He threw himself upon the ground, and tossed and moaned
in despair.Nature--God himself--seemed to conspire with Diego.He drew the new medal scapulary
around in front of him and kissed it, reverently crossing himself."_Santa Virgen_," he prayed, "help me--it is for the child!"Then,
taking between his teeth the knife which Diego had dropped, he rushed
into the water and struck out for the distant village of Juncal.*       *       *       *       *

Late that afternoon, while the tropical rain was descending in
torrents, Rosendo staggered into the parish house, where Carmen and
Jose were absorbed in their work.he gasped, "_Loado sea
Dios!_" as his eyes fell upon the girl.Then he sank to the floor in
utter exhaustion.cried Jose, bending over him in apprehension,
while Carmen stood lost in wonder.cried Rosendo, raising himself up on his elbow.cried both Jose and the girl in astonishment.Instinctively Jose's arm went about the child.Rosendo dragged himself
to a chair and sank limply into it."Then, Padre, he will come.Slowly the story came out, bit by bit."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, concluding his dramatic and
disconnected recital, "I plowed through the water--_Caramba!_ I knew
not at what moment I should feel the jaws of a cayman seize upon me!_Bien_, I was then glad, for had I appeared in the village, all would
have said that I had murdered Diego!And so I struck out along the
trail that skirts the lake, and followed it around until I came here.And the rain--H_ombre_!it
beat me down--I fell again and again!And then, the fear that I was
too late--_Ah, Dios_!But she is safe--_Caramba_!"But, Rosendo," said Jose anxiously, "where can Diego--"

"He is here, _Caramba_!but I shall set out at
once and search every house!And he shall do well if he escape this
time!"But dusk was falling; and the old man, his strength sapped, listened
not unwillingly to Jose's better counsel.With the coming of night the
rain ceased, and the clouds rolled up and slipped down behind the
mountains, leaving the moon riding in splendor across the infinite
blue.Then Jose, leaving Carmen with Rosendo, walked to and fro
through the streets of the old town, listening and watching.He
wandered down to the lake.He climbed the hill where stood the second
church.He thought he caught the gleam of a light within the old
edifice.Their voices sounded
ghostly to his straining ears."But, friend Ricardo, he set out before dawn, and is not yet returned.I fear he has either abandoned us, or has walked into our good
Rosendo's jaws.""It is
more likely that he and Don Mario lie pickled in rum under the palms
of the Alcalde's _patio_!"He hurried down through the main street
and past the house of Don Mario.The door stood open, and he could see
the portly figure of the official outlined against the back wall.It
was evident that Diego was not there.He returned in perplexity to his
house and sat far into the night, musing on the strange incident.With the coming of the new day Rosendo appeared with fresh suggestions."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "there is nothing to do now but take the girl
and flee to the Boque river and to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas.""_Caramba!_" he muttered, "but this is a mystery!"Your canoe, Don Rosendo--as I started out
on the lake to fish I saw it, far in the distance.Did it break away from its
mooring, think you?"The latter replied quickly: "That is the most
reasonable supposition, Juan.But Rosendo is very grateful to you for
securing it again."When the lad had gone, Rosendo sat with bowed head, deeply perplexed."The pole and paddle, Padre, were left on the island.He--the boat--it must
have drifted long.Or--"

He stopped and scratched his head."Padre," he said, looking up
suddenly with an expression of awe upon his face, "do you suppose--do
you think that the Virgin--that she--made him fall from the canoe into
the lake--and that a _cayman_ ate him?_Ca-ram-ba!_"

Jose did not vouchsafe a reply.But his heart leaped with a great
hope.Rosendo, wrapped in profound meditation, wandered back to his
house, his head bent, and his hands clasped tightly behind his back.CHAPTER 29


The rainy season dragged its reeking length through the Simiti valley
with fearful deliberation.Jose thought that he should never again see
the sun.Great clouds of heavy vapor
rolled incessantly upward from the dripping jungle.The rain fell in
cloud-bursts, and the narrow streets of the old town ran like streams
in a freshet.Then, one day, Rosendo abruptly announced, "Padre, the rains are
breaking.And the little Carmen is fourteen
years old to-day."And
Carmen was no longer a child.Youth ripens quickly into maturity in
these tropic lands.The past year had sped like a meteor across an
evening sky, leaving a train of mingled light and darkness.Of Diego's
fate Jose had learned nothing.Ricardo and his companion had
disappeared without causing even a ripple of comment in Simiti.But he often eyed Jose and
Rosendo malignantly through the wooden grill at his window, and once
he ordered Fernando to stop Rosendo and ply him with many and pointed
questions.The old man was noncommittal, but he left a dark suspicion,
which was transmitted to the receptive mind of the Alcalde.Acting-Bishop Wenceslas likewise was growing apprehensive as the weeks
went by, and both Jose and Don Mario were the recipients of letters of
inquiry from him regarding the whereabouts of the priest Diego.In the
course of time came other letters from Cartagena, and at length an
order for a most scrutinizing search to be made for the Bishop's
confidential agent.Rosendo's oft-repeated testimony revealed nothing.The citizens of Simiti had not seen the man.The Alcalde had nothing
but his suspicions to offer.And these might have fallen harmlessly
upon the acting-Bishop's well occupied thought, had it not been for
the complicating influence of certain other events.The first of these
was the exhaustion of the gold which Jose and Carmen had discovered in
the old church.The other was the outbreak of the religio-political
revolution which Diego had predicted some six years before, and which,
in these latter days, Don Jorge, on his infrequent journeys through
Simiti had repeatedly announced as inevitable and imminent.Their
combined effect was such as to wrest Carmen away from Jose, and to set
in a new direction the currents of their lives.For some time past Jose had patched with growing anxiety the
shrinking of his gold supply, and had striven to lessen the monthly
contributions to Cartagena, meanwhile trying to know that the need
now looming daily larger before him would be met.He had not voiced
his apprehension to Carmen.But he and Rosendo had discussed the
situation long and earnestly, and had at length resolved that the
latter should again return to Guamoco to wash the Tigui sands.The old man sighed, but he uttered no protest.Yet each day Jose
thought he grew quieter.And each day, too, he seemed to become more
tender of his sad-faced daughter, Ana, and of the little grandson who
had come into his humble home only a few weeks before.He delayed his
preparations for specious reasons which Jose knew cost him much effort
to invent.He told his rosary often before the
church altar, and with tears in his eyes.And at night he would come
to Jose and beg him to read from the Bible and explain what he thought
the Saviour had really meant to convey to the humble fishermen of
Galilee.But at last the day arrived when he had
nothing to send to Cartagena beyond the mere pittance which the poor
members of his little parish contributed.Then came a letter from Wenceslas,
requesting an explanation.And then it was that Jose realized that in
his excess of zeal he had fallen into his own trap.For, having
established the custom of remitting a certain amount to the Bishop
each month, he must not resent now the implication of dishonesty when
the remittances fell off, or ceased altogether."_Bien_, Padre," said the latter slowly, "the time has come.In the days that followed, Jose could frame no satisfactory reply to
Wenceslas, and so the latter wrote to the Alcalde.Don Mario eagerly
seized the proffered opportunity to ingratiate himself into
ecclesiastical favor.Rosendo was again in the hills, he wrote, and
with supplies not purchased from him.Nor had he been given even a
hint of Rosendo's mission, whether it be to search again for La
Libertad, or not.There could be no doubt, he explained in great
detail, of Jose's connivance with Rosendo, and of his unauthorized
conduct in the matter of educating the girl, Carmen, who, he made no
doubt, was the daughter of Padre Diego--now, alas!probably cold in
death at the violent hands of the girl's foster-father, and with the
priest Jose's full approbation.The letter cost the portly Don Mario
many a day of arduous labor; but it brought its reward in another
inquiry from Cartagena, and this time a request for specific details
regarding Carmen.He dropped his customary well-oiled
manner, and carried his head with the air of a conqueror.His thick
lips became regnant, imperious.He treated his compatriots with
supercilious disdain.And to Jose he would scarce vouchsafe even a
cold nod as they passed in the street.Again he penned a long missive
to Cartagena, in which he dilated at wearisome length upon the
extraordinary beauty of the girl, as well as her unusual mental
qualities.He urged immediate action, and suggested that Carmen be
sent to the convent in Mompox.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas mused long over the Alcalde's letters.Then he sent for a young clerical agent of the See, who
was starting on a mission to Bogota, and requested that he stop off a
day at Badillo and go to Simiti to report on conditions in that
parish.Incidentally, also, to gather what data he might as to the
family of one Rosendo Ariza.In due course of time the agent made his report.The parish of Simiti
stood in need of a new _Cura_, he said.And the girl--he found no
words to describe or explain her.The Church had
need of prompt action, however, to secure her.To that end, he advised
her immediate removal to Cartagena.Aside from the girl, to whom he found his
thought reverting oftener than he could wish in that particular hour
of stress, his interest in Simiti did not extend beyond its
possibilities as a further contributor to the funds he was so greatly
needing for the furtherance of his complex political plans.As to the
Alcalde--here was a possibility of another sort.And at the same time warned
against precipitate action, lest he scatter Rosendo's family into
flight, and the graceful bird now dwelling in the rude nest escape the
sharp talons awaiting her."Send a message to Francisco, our Legate,
who is now in Bogota.Bid him on his return journey stop again at
Simiti.We require a full report on the character of the Alcalde of
that town."*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, Jose did not permit his mental torture to interfere
with Carmen's education.For six years now that had progressed
steadily.Wonderful, he thought--and yet not
wholly attributable to his peculiar mode of tutelage.For, after
all, his work had been little more than the holding of her mind
unwarped, that her instinctive sense of logic might reach those
truthful conclusions which it was bound to attain if guided safely
past the tortuous shifts of human speculation and undemonstrable
theory.To his great joy, these six years had confirmed a belief
which he had held ever since the troublous days of his youth,
namely, that, as a recent writer has said, "adolescent understanding
is along straight lines, and leaps where the adult can only
laboriously creep."There had been no awful hold of early teaching
to loosen and throw off; there were no old landmarks in her mind
to remove; no tenacious, clinging effect of early associations to
neutralize.And, perhaps most important of all, the child had seemed
to enter the world utterly devoid of fear, and with a congenital
faith, amounting to absolute knowledge, in the immanence of an
omnipotent God of love.This, added to her eagerness and mental
receptivity, had made his task one of constant rejoicing in the
realization of his most extravagant dreams for her.As a linguist, Carmen had become accomplished.And it was only a matter of practice to give her a similar
grasp of French, Italian, and German.As for other instruction,
such knowledge of the outside world as he had deemed wise to give her
in these six years had been seized upon with avidity and as
quickly assimilated.But he often speculated curiously--sometimes
dubiously--upon the great surprises in store for her should she ever
leave her native village.And yet, as often as such thought recurred
to him he would try to choke it back, to bar his mind against it, lest
the pull at his heartstrings snap them asunder.Often as he watched her expanding so rapidly into womanhood and
exhibiting such graces of manner, such amiability of disposition,
such selfless regard for others, combined with a physical beauty
such as he thought he had never before gazed upon, a great yearning
would clutch his soul, and a lump would rise in his throat.And
when, as was so often the case, her arms flew impulsively about his
neck and she whispered words of tender endearment in his ear, a
fierce determination would seize him, and he would clutch her to
himself with such vehemence as to make her gasp for breath.That she
might marry he knew to be a possibility.But the idea pierced his
soul as with a sword, and he thought that to see her in the arms of
another, even the man of her choice, must excite him to murder.One
day, shortly after her fourteenth birthday, she came to him and,
perching herself as was her wont upon his knees, and twining her arms
about his neck, said, with traces of embarrassment, "Padre dear,
Juan--he asked me to-day to marry him."She--marry a peon of Simiti!To
be sure, Juan had often reminded him of the request he had made for
her hand long ago.But Jose had not considered the likelihood of the
lad's taking his question directly to her.And the girl--

"And what did you reply?""Padre dear--I told him that--" She stopped abruptly."Well, _chiquita_; you told him--what?"He held her back from him and looked
squarely into her wide eyes."You told him, _chiquita_--"

"That--well, Padre dear, I told him that--that I might never marry.""And do you think, little girl, that you will always hold
to that resolution?""Yes, Padre, unless--"

"Well, _chiquita_, unless--"

"Unless you marry, too, Padre," she said, dropping her eyes.But--what has that to do with it,
girl?""Well--oh, Padre dear--can't you see?For then I would marry--" She
buried her face in his shoulder."Yes, _chiquita_," he said, dully wondering.It was the first expression of the kind that had ever come from her
lips.The Goddess of Fortune had
suddenly thrown her most precious jewel into his lap.Joy welled up in
flood tides from unknown depths within.Minutes passed, and the two sat very quiet."Padre," she whispered, "you don't say anything.And you will not always be a priest--not always," shaking her
beautiful curls with suggestive emphasis.The people called her an
_hada_.And then he knew that
she never moved except in response to a beckoning hand that still,
after all these years, remained invisible to him."_Chiquita_," he said in low response, "I fear--I fear that can never
be.And even if--ah, _chiquita_, I am so much older than you, little
girl--almost seventeen years!""You do not want to marry me, even if you could, Padre?"she queried,
looking wistfully into his eyes, while her own grew moist.he cried wildly, "you little
know--you little know!But--child, we must not talk of these things!"But, Padre dear," she pleaded, "just say that you _do_ love me that
way--just say it--your little girl wants to hear it."She, pleading that he would say he loved her!He silently prayed that his tortured soul might burst
and let his wasted life ebb into oblivion while his pent-up misery
poured out."I love you--love
you--love you!"Some day, Padre dear," she
murmured softly, "you will stop thinking that two and two are seven.She sank back in his arms and nestled close to him, as if she longed
to enter his empty heart and fill the great void with her measureless
love."And, Padre dear," she whispered, "your little girl will wait for
you--yes, she will wait."*       *       *       *       *

It was some days later that Rosendo, after returning almost empty
handed from the hills, came to Jose and said, "Padre, I have sold my
_hacienda_ to Don Luis.I need the money to purchase supplies and to
get the papers through for some denouncements which I have made in
Guamoco.I knew that Don Mario would put through no papers for me, and
so I have asked Lazaro to make the transaction and to deliver the
titles to me when the final papers arrive.I have a blank here to be
filled out with the name and description of a mineral property.I--what would be a good name for a mine, Padre?""Why do you ask that, Rosendo?""Because, Padre, I want a foreign name--one not known, here."There is a city, a great city, that I have often
heard about, up in the States," he said finally.He took up the little atlas which he had received long since with
other books from abroad."Look," he said, "it is called Chicago.Call
your property the Chicago mine, Rosendo.It is a name unknown down
here, and there can no confusion arise because of it.""_Caramba!_" Rosendo muttered, trying to twist his tongue around the
word, "it is certain that no one else will use that name in Guamoco!But that makes my title still more secure, no?""But, Rosendo," said Jose, when the full significance of the old man's
announcement had finally penetrated, "you have sold your _finca_!And
to acquire title to property that you can never sell or work!And the
sword that hangs above us may fall any day!""_Bien_, Padre, it is for her sake that I have done it.But, if the titles
should come from Cartagena during my absence--and, Padre, if anything
should happen to me--for the love of the Virgin do not let them out of
your hands!Yet Rosendo departed not on the morrow.He remained to mingle his
tears with those of the sorrowing Ana.For the woman, whose heart had
been lighter since the arrival of her babe, had come to the priest
that day to have the child christened.And so, before the sun might
fill the _plaza_ with its ardent midday heat, Rosendo and his family
repaired to the church.There before the altar Jose baptised the
little one and gave it his own name, thus triumphantly ushering the
pagan babe into the Christian Catholic world.The child cried at the
touch of the baptismal water."Now," commented Rosendo, "the devil has gone out of him, driven out
by the holy water."But, as Jose leaned over the babe and looked into its dark eyes, his
hand stopped, and his heart stood still.He raised his head and bent a
look of inquiry upon the mother.She returned the look with one that
mutely voiced a stifled fear and confirmed his own.He took a candle from the altar and passed it before the child's
eyes._Santa Virgen!_ Do not tell me--_Dios mio_!"The
mother's voice rose to a wail, as she snatched her babe away.Dona Maria stood mute; but Jose as
he looked at her divined her thought and read therein a full knowledge
of the awful fact that she had never voiced to the heart-broken
mother.Ana, what ails the
child?"Carmen crowded close to the weeping Ana."The babe, Rosendo," she said quietly, "was born--blind."CHAPTER 30


The "revolutionist" of Latin America is generally only the disgruntled
politician.His revolution is seldom more than a violent squabble
among greedy spoilsmen for control of the loose-jointed administration.But the great Mosquera Revolution which burst into flame in New
Granada in 1861 was fed with fuel of a different nature.It
demonstrated, if demonstration were necessary, that the Treaty of
Westphalia did not write _finis_ to the history of bloodshed in the
name of Christ; that it had but banked the fires of religious
animosity, until the furnace should be transferred from the Old World to
the New, where the breath of liberty would again fan them into
vigorous activity.The Mosquera War tore asunder Church and State; but left unhappy
Colombia prone and bleeding.It externalized a mighty protest of
enlightenment against Rome's dictates in temporal affairs.And, as has
before happened when that irresistible potentiality, the people, has
been stirred into action, the Church was disestablished, its property
confiscated, and its meddling, parasitical clergy disenfranchised.But then, too, as almost invariably occurs when the masses find that
they have parted with cherished prejudices and effete customs, and
have adopted ideas so radical as to lift them a degree higher in the
scale of progress, they wavered.The holy sacrament of marriage was
debased to a civil ceremony.Education was endangered by taking it out
of the hands of the pious clergy.Texts unauthorized by Holy Church
were being adopted.The alarm
spread, fanned by the watchful agents of Rome.And twenty years of incessant internecine warfare followed.And when
it was seen that Roman Catholicism was therein again declared to be
the national religion of the Republic of Colombia; when it was noted
that the clergy, obedient to a foreign master, were to be readmitted
to participation in government affairs; when it was understood that a
national press-censorship was to be established, dominated by Holy
Church; and when, in view of this, the great religio-political
opponent was seen laying down her weapons and extending her arms in
dubious benediction over the exhausted people, the masses yielded--and
there was great rejoicing on the banks of the Tiber over the
prodigal's return.When Wenceslas Ortiz was placed in temporary control of the See of
Cartagena he shrewdly urged the Church party to make at least a
pretense of disbanding as a political organization.The provinces
of Cundinamarca and Panama were again in a state of ferment.Congress, sitting in Bogota, had before it for consideration a
measure vesting in the President the power to interfere in certain
states or provinces whenever, in his opinion, the conservation of
public order necessitated such action.That this measure would be
passed, Wenceslas could not be sure.But that, once adopted, it would
precipitate the unhappy country again into a sanguinary war, he
thought he knew to a certainty.He had faced this same question six
years before, when a similar measure was before Congress.But then,
with a strong Church party, and believing the passage of the law to be
certain, he had yielded to the counsel of hot-headed leaders in
Cartagena, and approved the inauguration of hostilities.Congress dropped the measure like a
hot plate.The demands of the "revolutionists" were quickly met by the
federal government.The _causae belli_ evaporated.And Wenceslas
retired in chagrin to the solitude of his study, to bite his nails and
wonder dubiously if his party were strong enough to insure his
appointment to the See of Cartagena in the event of the then aged
occupant's demise.It was this hasty judgment of Wenceslas and his political associates
which had delayed further consideration of the objectionable measure
for six years.But the interim had seen his party enormously
strengthened, himself in control of the See, and his preparations
completed for turning the revolt, whenever it should come, to his own
great advantage.He had succeeded in holding the Church party aloof
from actual participation in politics during the present crisis.And
he was now keeping it in constant readiness to throw its tremendous
influence to whichever side should offer the greatest inducements.Congress dallied; and then prepared
to adjourn.Wenceslas received a code message from his agent in Bogota
that the measure would be laid on the table.At the same time came a
sharp <DW8> from New York.The funds had been provided to finance the
impending revolution.Had the Church party exaggerated its influence upon
Congress?"_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, as he paced
angrily back and forth in his study.A
curse--"

He stopped still.In the midst of his imprecations an idea occurred to
him.He went to his _escritorio_ and drew out the Legate's recent
report."Ah," he mused, "that pig-headed Alcalde.Then he summoned his secretary and dictated telegrams to Bogota and
New York, and a long letter to the Alcalde of Simiti.These finished,
he called a young acolyte in waiting."Take a message to the Governor," he commanded."Say to His Excellency
that I shall, call upon him at three this afternoon, to discuss
matters of gravest import."Dismissing his secretary, he leaned back
in his chair and dropped into a profound revery.Shortly before the hour which he had set for conference with the
Departmental Governor, Wenceslas rose and went to his _escritorio_,
from which he took a paper-bound book._Bien_, I was correct in my surmise that I should some day have use
for this little volume.But--_Bien_, I think
it will do--I think it will do."A smile played over his handsome, imperious face.Then he snapped the
book shut and took up his hat.At the door he hesitated a moment, with
his hand on the knob."If the Alcalde were not such a fool, it would be impossible," he
mused."But--the combination--the isolation of Simiti--the imbecility
of Don Mario--the predicament of our little Jose--_Hombre_!it is a
rare situation, and it will work.It _must_ work--_cielo_!With the
pig-headed Alcalde seizing government arms to suppress the Church
party as represented by the foolish Jose, and with the President
sending federal troops to quell the disturbance, the anticlericals
will rise in a body throughout the country.Then Congress will hastily
pass the measure to support the President, the Church party will swing
into line with the Government--and the revolution will be on.Simiti
provides the setting and the fuel; I, the torch.I will cable again to
Ames when I leave the Governor."He swung the door open and went
briskly out.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre, I am crushed."He and Jose were sitting out in the
gathering dusk before the parish house on the evening of the day that
Ana's babe had been christened.The old man's head was sunk upon his
breast, and he rocked back and forth groaning aloud."We must be brave, Rosendo," returned Jose tenderly."We have gone
through much, you and I, since I came to Simiti.But--we have believed
it to be in a good cause."But, Padre, after it all, to have her babe come into the world blind!Padre, it is the last thing
that I can endure.I cannot return now to
Guamoco."Rosendo," said Jose, drawing his chair closer to the old man, and
laying a hand on his, "we have fought long and hard.But, if I mistake
not, the greatest struggle is yet to come.The greatest demand upon
your strength and mine is still to be made.""This: Juan returned from Bodega Central
this evening.He reports that several large boxes are there, consigned
to Don Mario, and bearing the government stamp.He found one of them
slightly broken, and he peered within.Jose went on:

"I did not intend to tell you this until morning.But it is right that
you should hear it now, that your courage may rise in the face of
danger.The federal government is sending arms to
Simiti to establish a base here at the outlet of the Guamoco region,
and well hidden from the Magdalena river.This town is to become a
military depot, unless I mistake the signs.And danger no longer
threatens, but is at our door."Rosendo rose slowly and drew himself up to his full
height."There is no question about it, Rosendo," replied Jose gravely."And I
have no reason to doubt the truth of Diego's prophecy, that this time
it will be one to be reckoned with.""Take her into the hills, Rosendo.Jose's thought was dwelling on his last talk with the girl.Again he
felt her soft arms about his neck, and her warm breath against his
cheek.He felt her kiss, and heard again her words, the sweetest, he
thought, that had ever echoed in mortal ears.And then he thought of
his mother, of his office, of the thousand obstacles that loomed huge
and insurmountable between him and Carmen.He passed a hand across his
brow and sighed heavily.I welcome, not
only the opportunity for service which this war may bring, but
likewise the hope of--death.If I could but know that she were
safe--"

"_Caramba_!Think you she would leave you here, Padre?Did
Rosendo's words convey aught to the priest that he did not already
know?"But--Rosendo, I shall not go," he returned bitterly."Then neither do we, Padre," replied Rosendo, sitting again."The
child, Carmen--she--Padre, she loves you with a love that is not of
the earth."*       *       *       *       *

Morning found the old man's conviction still unshaken.Jose sought the
quiet of his cottage to reflect.But his meditations were interrupted
by Carmen."Padre," she began, sparkling like a mountain rill in the sunlight as
she seated herself before him."Pepito--Anita's babe--he is not blind,
you know."Her head bobbed vigorously, as was her wont when she sought
to give emphasis to her dramatic statements.Jose smiled, and resigned himself to the inevitable."And, Padre, have you been thankful that he isn't?"You know, Padre Diego thought he couldn't see the reality.He
looked always at his bad thoughts.And so the not seeing, and the
seeing of only bad things, were both--externalized, and the babe came
to us without sight.That is, without what the human mind calls sight.And now," she went on excitedly, "you and I have just _got_ to know
that it isn't so!And I have
thanked Him all morning that this is so, and that you and I see it."Well--I suppose so," replied Jose abstractedly, his thought still
occupied with the danger that hung over the little town.There isn't any'suppose' about it!The eye is made _by_ the
sight.It thinks that sight
depends upon the optic nerve, and upon the fleshly eye.It is the sight that externalizes the'meaty' eye.You see, the
sight is within, not without.God is all-seeing; and so,
sight is eternal.But what he saw was the
beautiful, animated girl before him.And the thought that he must some
day be separated from her was eating his heart like a canker."Well, then," went on the girl, without waiting for his reply, "if a
mortal's mental concept of sight is poor, why, he will manifest poor
eyes.If the thought-concept were right, the manifestation would be
right."By that I
suppose you mean, _chiquita_, that the babe's thought, or concept, of
sight was all wrong, and so he came into the world blind.""Not at all, Padre," she quickly replied."The babe had nothing to do
with it, except to seem to manifest the wrong thoughts of its father,
or mother, or both.Or perhaps it manifests just simply bad thoughts,
without the bad thoughts belonging to anybody.For, you know, we none
of us really _have_ such thoughts.They are just a part of the one big lie about God.""Surely; the real babe is a child of God, and sees.""But the human babe doesn't see," he retorted."But," she replied, "what you call the human babe is only your mental
concept of the babe.And you see that mental concept as a blind one.See only God's child,
with perfect sight.And, Padre, after a while _you will see that babe
seeing things, just as we do_!she exclaimed, as he sat looking fixedly at
her."Don't you see that if you have the right thought about the babe,
and hold to it, and put out every thought that says it is blind, why,
your right thought will be externalized in a mental concept of a babe
that sees?Don't you know that that is exactly what Jesus did?He
didn't affect the real man at all.But he did change the mental
concepts which we call human beings.And we can do the same, if we
only know it, and follow him, and spiritualize our thought, as he did,
by putting out and keeping out every thought that we know does not
come from God, and that is, therefore, only a part of the lie about
Him.Here is a case where we have got to quit thinking that two and
two are seven.It is God's business to make our
concepts right.And we will see these,
right concepts if we will put out the wrong ones!"he queried lamely, wholly at a loss for any other answer."Well, Padre, I am not a bit afraid.I don't see a blind babe at all,
because there just can't be any."In other words, you don't intend to allow yourself to be deceived by
appearances?""Blindness is only an
appearance.But it doesn't appear to God, It appears only to the human
mind--which isn't any mind at all!And the appearance can be made to
disappear, if we know the truth and stick to it.For any appearance of
a human body is a mental concept, that's all.""Yes, a thing of _wrong_ thought.But all wrong thought is subject
to God's right thought.We've proved that, haven't we, lots of
times?Well, this wrong thought about a babe that is blind can be
changed--made to disappear--just as any lie can be made to disappear
when we know the truth.And so you and I are not going to be afraid,
are we?I told Anita this morning not to worry, but to just _know_
all the time that her babe did see, no matter what the appearance
was.And she smiled at me, Padre, she smiled.And I know that she
trusts, and is going to work with you and me."had he done aught of late but work against her
by his constant harboring of fears, of doubts, and his distrust of
spiritual power?"Padre," she resumed, "I want you to promise me that every day you
will thank God that the babe really sees.And that you will turn right
on every thought of blindness and know that it is a part of the lie
about God, and put it right out of your mind."But--child--if my mind tells me that the babe is blind, how can I--"

"I don't care what your mind tells you about the babe!You are to
listen to what God tells you, not your human mind!Does God tell you
that the babe is blind?"Why, no, _chiquita_, He--"

"Listen, Padre," she interrupted again, drawing closer to him."Is God
good, or bad, or both?""He is good, _chiquita_, all good.""And we have long since proved by actual reasoning and demonstration
that He is mind, and so infinite mind, no?""Well, an infinite mind has all power.And an infinite, all-powerful
mind that is all good could not possibly create anything bad, or sick,
or discordant--now could He?"But--the five physical
senses tell us differently."And yet, we know that the five physical senses _do not tell us
truth_!We know that when the human mind thinks it is receiving
reports about things through the five physical senses it is doing
nothing more than looking at its own thoughts."The thoughts of an infinite and good mind must be like that mind, all
good, no?Well, then, thoughts of discord, disease, blindness, and
death--do they come from the infinite, good mind?"Well, _chiquita mia_, that is just the sticking point.But the mighty question is, where _do_ those thoughts come
from?I am quite as ready as you to admit that discord, sin, evil,
death, and all the whole list of human ills and woes come from these
bad thoughts held in the human mind and so externalized.I believe
that the human man really sees, feels, hears, smells, and tastes these
thoughts--that the functioning of the physical senses is wholly
mental--takes place in mind, in thought only.That is, that the human
mind thinks it sees, feels, hears; but that the whole process is
mental, and that it is but regarding its thoughts, instead of actually
regarding and cognizing objects outside of itself."Isn't that just what I am
trying to tell you?""But--and here is the great obstacle--we differentiate between good
and bad thoughts.We agree that a fountain can not send forth sweet
and bitter waters at the same time.And so, good and bad thoughts do
not come from the infinite mind that we call God.Answer that, _chiquita_, and my problems will all be
solved."She looked at him in perplexity for some time.It seemed to her
that she never would understand him.But, with a little sigh of
resignation, she replied:

"Padre, you answered that question yourself, long ago.You worked it
all out three or four years ago.You let
the false testimony of the physical senses mesmerize you again.Instead of sticking to the thoughts that you knew to be good, and
holding to them, in spite of the pelting you got from the others, you
have looked first at the good, and then at the bad, and then believed
them all to be real, and all to be powerful.And so you got miserably
mixed up.And the result is that you don't know where you stand.Or, you think you don't; for that thought, too, is a bad one, and
has no power at all, excepting the power that you seem willing--and
glad--to give it."He knew in his heart that she was
right.He had not clung to the good, despite the roars of Satan.He
had not "resisted unto blood."Far from it; he had fallen, almost
invariably, at the first shower of the adversary's darts.And now, was
he not trying, desperately, to show her that Ana's babe was blind,
hopelessly so?Was he not fighting on evil's side, and vigorously,
though with shame suffusing his face, waving aloft the banner of
error?"The trouble with you, Padre," the girl resumed, after some moments of
reflection, "is that you--you see everything--well, you see everything
as a person, or a thing.""You mean that I always associate thought with personality?"But you have got to learn to deal with thoughts and ideas
by themselves, apart from any person or thing.You have got to learn
to deal with facts and their opposites entirely apart from places, or
things, or people.Now if I say that Life is eternal, I have stated a
mental thing.Its opposite, that is, the opposite of
Life, is death.That being so, Life is the reality, and death is the unreality.Very
well, what makes death seem real?It is just because the false thought
of death comes into the human mind, and is held there as a reality, as
something that has _got_ to happen.And that strong belief becomes
externalized in what mortals call death.Is there a
person in the whole world who doesn't think that some time he has got
to die?But now suppose every person held the belief that
death was an illusion, a part of the big lie about God, just as Jesus
said it was.Well, wouldn't we get rid of death in a hurry?And is there a person in the whole world who wouldn't say
that Anita's babe was blind?They would look at the human
thought of blindness, instead of God's real idea of sight, and so they
would make and keep the babe blind.Don't you understand me, Padre
dear?I know you do, for you really see as God sees!"Her eyes glistened, and her whole body seemed
to radiate the light of knowledge divine.Then she went hurriedly on:

"Padre, everything is mental.You know that, for you told me so, long
since.Well, that being so, we have got to face the truth that every
mental fact seems to have an opposite, or a lot of opposites, also
seemingly mental.Infinite mind is the
infinite fact.The so-called opposite of this infinite fact is the
human mind, the many so-called minds of mankind--_a kind of man._ But
everything is still mental.Now, an illusion, or a lie, does not
_really_ exist.If I tell you that two and two are seven, that lie
does not exist.Is it in what we call my mind, or yours?Even if
you say you believe it, that doesn't make it real.Nor does it show
that it has real existence in your mind.But--if you
hold it, and cling to it--allow it to stay with you and influence
you--why, Padre dear, everything in your whole life will be changed!"Let me take your pencil--and a piece of paper.Look now," drawing a
line down through the paper."On one side, Padre, is the infinite
mind, God, and all His thoughts and ideas, all good, perfect and
eternal.On the other side is the lie about it all.That is still
mental; but it is illusion, falsity.It includes all sin, all
sickness, all murder, all evil, accidents, loss, failure, bad
ambitions, and death.These are all parts of the big lie about
God--His unreal opposite.These are the so-called thoughts that come
to the human mind.The human
mind looks at them, tastes them, feels them, holds them; and then they
become its beliefs.After a while the human mind looks at nothing but
these beliefs.And, finally, it comes to
believe that God made them and sent them to His children.Isn't it
awful, Padre!And aren't you glad that you know about it?And aren't
you going to learn how to keep the good on one side of that line and
the illusion on the other?"It seemed to Jose a thing incredible that these words were coming from
a girl of fifteen.And yet he knew that at the same tender age he was
as deeply serious as she--but with this difference: he was then
tenaciously clinging to the thoughts that she was now utterly
repudiating as unreal and non-existent."Padre dear," the girl resumed, "everything is mental."Well," he replied reflectively, "at least our comprehension of it is
wholly mental.""Why--it is all inside--it is all in our thought!Padre, when Hernando
plays on that old pipe of his, where is the music?"But, _chiquita_, we don't seem to have it in our thought until we
seem to see him playing on the pipe, do we?""No, we don't," she replied.It is just because
the human mind believes that everything, even music, must come from
matter--must have a--"

"Must have a material origin?And men even believe that life itself has a material origin; and
so they have wasted centuries trying to find it in the body.They
don't seem to want to know that God is life.""Then, _chiquita_, you do not believe that matter is real?""There is no matter outside of us, or around us, Padre," she said in
reply."The human mind looks at its thoughts and seems to see them out
around it as things made of matter.But, after all, it only sees its
thoughts.""Then I suppose that the externalization of our thought in our
consciousness constitutes what we call space, does it not?""It must, Padre," she answered.Then:

"_Chiquita_, how do you know me?What do you see that you call'me'?""Why, Padre, I see you as God does--at least, I try always to see you
that way?""And that is the way Jesus always
saw people."But, does He see me as I see myself?""You do not see yourself, Padre," was her reply."You see only the
thoughts that you call yourself.Thoughts of mind and body and all
those things that go to form a human being.""Well--yes, I must agree with you there; for, though God certainly
knows me, He cannot know me as I think I know myself, sinful and
discordant.""He knows the real 'you,' Padre dear.He
knows that the unreal 'you,' the 'you' that you think you know, is
illusion.If He knew the human, mortal 'you' as real, He would have to
know evil."No, for the Bible says He is of eyes too pure to behold evil.""Well, Padre, why don't you try to be like Him?"But the girl needed not that he should answer her question.She knew
why he had failed, for "without faith it is impossible to please him:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him."She knew that Jose's
struggle to overcome evil had been futile, because he had first
made evil real.She knew that the difficulty he had experienced in
keeping his thought straight was because he persisted in looking at
both the good and the evil.Lot's wife, in the Bible allegory, had
turned back to look at things material and had been transformed into
a pillar of salt.Jose had turned again and again to his materialistic
thoughts; and had been turned each time to salt tears.She knew that
he gave up readily, that he yielded easily to evil's strongest
tool, discouragement, and fell back into self-condemnation, whereby he
only rendered still more real to himself the evil which he was
striving to overcome.She knew that the only obstacle that he was
wrestling with in his upward progress was the universal belief in a
power other than God, good, which is so firmly fixed in the human
consciousness.But she likewise knew that this hindrance was but a
false conviction, and that it could and would be overcome."Padre," she reflected, looking up at him in great seriousness, "if a
lie had an origin, it would be true, wouldn't it?"He regarded her attentively, but without replying."But Jesus said that Satan was the father of lies.And Satan, since he
is the father of lies, must himself be a lie.You see, Padre, we can
go right back to the very first chapter in the Bible.First comes the
account of the real creation.Then comes the account as the human
mind looks at it.But that comes after the'mist' had gone up from
the ground, from dirt, from matter.That mist was
error, the opposite of Good.It was
the human mind and all human thought, the opposite of the infinite
Mind, God, and His thought.So every bit
of evil that you can possibly think of comes from the material,
physical senses.Evil is always a mist, hiding the good.The physical universe, the universe of matter, is the way the
human mind sees its thoughts of the spiritual universe that was
created by God.The human mind is just a bundle of these false
thoughts; and you yourself have said that the human consciousness
was a 'thought-activity, concerned with the activity of false
thought.'The human mind is the lie about the infinite mind.It
has no principle, and nothing to stand on.The minute you turn the
truth upon it, why, it vanishes.""Well, then, _chiquita_, why don't people turn the truth upon it
everywhere?""Because they are mesmerized by the error, Padre.They sit looking at
these false thoughts and believing them true.Padre, all disease, all
evil, comes from the false thought in the human mind.It is that
thought externalized in the human consciousness.And when the human
mind turns from them, and puts them out, and lets the true thoughts
in, why--why, _then we will raise the dead_!""But, _chiquita_, the human body--if it has died--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "the human body and human mind are one and
the same.The body that you think you see is
but your thought of a body, and _is in your so-called human mind_!""And so would you if you read your Bible
in the right way.Why--I had never seen a Bible until you gave me
yours.I didn't know what a book it was!And to think that it has been
in the world for thousands of years, and yet people still kill one
another, still get sick, and still die!"But, _chiquita_, people are too busy to devote time to demonstrating
the truths of the Bible," he offered."Why--busy making money--busy socially--busy having a good time--busy
accumulating things that--that they must go away and leave to somebody
else!""They are like the people Jesus spoke of, too
busy with things that are of no account to see the things that
are--that are--"

"That are priceless, _chiquita_--that are the most vital of all things
to sinful, suffering mankind," he supplied.These hours
with Carmen had become doubly precious to him of late.Perhaps he felt
a presentiment that the net about him and his loved ones was drawing
rapidly tighter.Perhaps he saw the hour swiftly approaching, even at
hand, when these moments of spiritual intercourse would be rudely
terminated.And perhaps he saw the clouds lowering ever darker above
them, and knew that in the blackness which was soon to fall the girl
would leave him and be swept out into the great world of human
thoughts and events, to meet, alone with her God, the fiercest
elements, the subtlest wiles, of the carnal mind.As for himself--he
was in the hands of that same God."_Chiquita_," he said, "you do not
find mistakes in the Bible?For, out in the big world where I came
from, there are many, very many, who say that it is a book of
inconsistencies, of gross inaccuracies, and that its statements are
directly opposed to the so-called natural sciences.They say that it
doesn't even relate historical events accurately.But, after all,
the Bible is just the record of the unfoldment in the human
consciousness of the concept of God.Why cavil at it when it
contains, as we must see, a revelation of the full formula for
salvation, which, as you say, is right-thinking."And it even tells us what to think about.Paul said, you
know, that we should think about whatsoever things are true, honest,
just, pure, lovely, and of good report.Well, he told us that there
was no law--not even any human law--against those things.And don't
you know, he wrote about bringing into captivity every thought to
Christ?"Just what you have been telling me, I guess, _chiquita_: that every
thought must be measured by the Christ-principle.And if it doesn't
conform to that standard, it must be rejected."He did die daily to evil,
to all evil thought--"

"And to the testimony of the physical senses, think you?"For, in proving God to be real, he had to prove the
reports of the five physical senses to be only human beliefs.""You are right, _chiquita_.He must have known that the corporeal
senses were the only source from which evil came.He must have known
that unless God testified in regard to things, any other testimony was
but carnal belief.This must be so, for God, being infinite mind, is
also infinite intelligence.He knows all things, and knows them
aright--not as the human mind thinks it knows them, twisted and
deformed, but right."And can't you
_stick_ to it, and prove it?""_Chiquita_," he answered, shaking his head again, his words still
voicing a lingering note of doubt, "it may be--the 'I' that I call
myself may be entirely human, unreal, mortal.I make no doubt it is,
for it seems filled to the brim with discordant thoughts.she cried, with a trace of exasperation."Empty yourself
of the wrong thoughts--shut the door against them--don't let them in
any more!Then when the
mortal part fades away, why, the good will be left.And it will be the
right 'you.'""But how shall I empty myself, and then fill myself again?"cried the girl, springing from her chair and stamping her
foot with each word to give it emphasis."It is love, love, love,
nothing but love!Forget yourself, and love everything and everybody,
the real things and the real bodies!Love God, and good, and good
thoughts!Turn from the bad and the unreal--forget it!Why--"

"Wait, _chiquita_," he interrupted."A great war is threatening our
country at this very minute.Shall I turn from it and let come what
may?"But you can know that war comes only from the
human mind; that it is bad thought externalized; and that God is
peace, and is infinitely greater than such bad thought; and He will
take care of you--if you will let Him!"By sitting back and folding my hands and
saying, Here am I, Lord, protect me--"

"Oh, Padre dear, you make me ashamed of your foolish thought--which
isn't your thought at all, but just thought that seems to be calling
itself 'you.'Jesus said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do likewise.But that did not mean sitting back with folded
hands.It meant _understanding_ him; and knowing that there is no
power apart from the Christ-principle; and using that principle, using
it every moment, _hard_; and with it overcoming every thought that
doesn't come from God, every thought of the human mind, whether it is
called war, or sickness, or death!""Then evil can be thought away, _chiquita_?"He knew not why he
pursued her so relentlessly."No, Padre," she replied with a gentle patience that smote him.But it can be destroyed in the human mind.And when you have
overcome the habit of thinking the wrong way, evil will disappear.That is what Jesus tried to make the people
see."Yet he had not put it to the proof.He had gone
through life, worrying himself loose from one human belief, only to
become enslaved to another equally insidious.He knew that the cause
of whatever came to him was within his own mentality.And yet he knew,
likewise, that he would have to demonstrate this--that he would be
called upon to "prove" God.His faith without the works following was
dead.He felt that he did not really believe in power opposed to God;
and yet he did constantly yield to such belief.And such yielding was
the chief of sins.He knew that
when the Master had said, "Behold, I give you power over all the
enemy," he meant that the Christ-principle would overcome every false
claim of the human mentality, whether that claim be one of physical
condition or action, or a claim of environment and event.He knew that
all things were possible to God, and likewise to the one who
understood and faithfully applied the Christ-principle.Carmen
believed that good alone was real and present.She applied this
knowledge to every-day affairs.And in so doing she denied reality to
evil.He must turn upon the claims of evil to life and
intelligence.His false sense of righteousness _must_ give place to
the spiritual sense of God as immanent good.He knew that Carmen's
great love was an impervious armor, which turned aside the darts of
the evil one, the one lie.He knew that his reasoning from the premise
of mixed good and evil was false, and the results chaotic.And knowing
all this, he knew that he had touched the hem of the garment of the
Christ-understanding.There remained, then, the test of fire."Padre," said Carmen, going to him and putting her arms about his
neck, "you say that you think a great war is coming.Don't you remember what it says in the book of
Isaiah?'No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and
every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
condemn.This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their
righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.'No weapon of evil can
touch you, if you understand God.Every tongue of the human mind that
rises to judge you, to sentence you, shall be condemned.You will
condemn it--you _must_!This is your heritage, given you by God.And
your righteousness, your right-thinking, must come from God.Then--"

"Yes, yes, _chiquita_," he said, drawing her to him."And now, Padre, you will promise me that you will know every day that
Anita's babe is not blind--that it sees, because God sees?""Yes, _chiquita_, I promise.""Padre dear," she murmured, nestling close to him, "I love you so
much, so much!"He answered not, except in the tightening of the arm that was about
her.CHAPTER 31


In the weeks that followed there were days when the very air seemed
pregnant with potential destruction, awaiting only the daring hand
that would render it kinetic.Jose dwelt in a state of incessant,
heart-shaking agitation.The sudden precipitation of the revolt six
years before had caught him wholly unprepared, unaware even of the
events which had led to it.In the intervening years, however, he had
had some opportunity, even in his isolation, to study political
conditions in that unhappy country, and to form some estimate of the
mental forces at work in both Church and State which, he knew, must
ultimately bring them again into conflict for supremacy.His knowledge
of the workings of the human mind convinced him that Diego's dire
prophecy had not been empty; that the Church, though ostensibly
assuming only spiritual leadership, would nevertheless rest not until
the question "Who shall be greatest?"even in the petty, sordid
affairs of mortals, should be answered, and answered--though by force
of arms--in her favor.And his estimate of the strength of the
opposing parties had led him to believe that the impending struggle
would drench the land in blood.As to the _role_ which Wenceslas would play, he could form no
satisfactory estimate.He knew him to be astute, wary, and the
shrewdest of politicians.He knew, likewise, that he was acting in
conjunction with powerful financial interests in both North America
and Europe.He knew him to be a man who would stop at no scruple,
hesitate at no dictate of conscience, yield to no moral or ethical
code; one who would play Rome against Wall Street, with his own
unfortunate country as the stake; one who would hurl the fairest sons
of Colombia at one another's throats to bulge his own coffers; and
then wring from the wailing widows their poor substance for Masses to
move their beloved dead through an imagined purgatory.But he could not know that, in casting about impatiently for an
immediate _causus belli_, Wenceslas had hit upon poor, isolated,
little Simiti as the point of ignition, and the pitting of its
struggling priest against Don Mario as the method of exciting the
necessary spark.He could not know that Wenceslas had represented
to the Departmental Governor in Cartagena that an obscure _Cura_ in
far-off Simiti, an exile from the Vatican, and the author of a
violent diatribe against papal authority, was the nucleus about
which anticlerical sentiment was crystallizing in the Department
of Bolivar.He did not know that the Governor had been induced by the
acting-Bishop's specious representations to send arms to Simiti, to
be followed by federal troops only when the crafty Wenceslas saw
that the time was ripe.He did not even suspect that Don Mario was
to be the puppet whom Wenceslas would sacrifice on the altar of
rapacity when he had finished with him, and that the simple-minded
Alcalde in his blind zeal to protect the Church would thereby
proclaim himself an enemy of both Church and State, and afford the
smiling Wenceslas the most fortuitous of opportunities to reveal the
Church's unexampled magnanimity by throwing her influence in with
that of the Government against their common enemy.His own intercourse with Wenceslas during the years of his exile in
Simiti had been wholly formal, and not altogether disagreeable as long
as the contributions of gold to the Bishop's leaking coffers
continued.He had received almost monthly communications from
Cartagena, relating to the Church at large, and, at infrequent
intervals, to the parish of Simiti.But he knew that Cartagena's
interest in Simiti was merely casual--nay, rather, financial--and he
strove to maintain it so, lest the stimulation of a deeper interest
thwart his own plans.His conflict with Diego in regard to Carmen had
seemed for the moment to evoke the Bishop's interference; and the
sudden and unaccountable disappearance of that priest had threatened
to expose both Jose and Carmen to the full scrutiny of Wenceslas.But,
fortunately, the insistence of those matters which were rapidly
culminating in a political outbreak left Wenceslas little time for
interference in affairs which did not pertain exclusively to the
momentous questions with which he was now concerned, and Jose and
Carmen were still left unmolested.It was only when, desperate lest
Congress adjourn without passing the measure which he knew would
precipitate the conflict, and when, well nigh panic-stricken lest his
collusion with Ames and his powerful clique of Wall Street become
known through the exasperation of the latter over the long delay, he
had resolved to pit Don Mario against Jose in distant Simiti, and, in
that unknown, isolated spot, where close investigation would never be
made, apply the torch to the waiting combustibles, that Jose saw the
danger which had always hung over him and the girl suddenly descending
upon them and threatening anew the separation which he had ever
regarded as inevitable, and yet which he had hoped against hope to
avoid.With the deposition of arms in Simiti, and the establishment of
federal authority in Don Mario, that always pompous official rose in
his own esteem and in the eyes of a few parasitical attaches to an
eminence never before dreamed of by the humble denizens of this
moss-encrusted town.From egotistical, Don Mario became insolent.From
sluggishness and torpidity of thought and action, he rose suddenly
into tremendous activity.He was more than once observed by Jose or
Rosendo emerging hastily from his door and button-holing some one of
the more influential citizens of the town and excitedly reading to him
excerpts from letters which he had just received from Cartagena.He
might be seen at any hour of the day in the little _patio_ back of his
store, busily engaged with certain of the men of the place in
examining papers and documents, talking volubly and with much excited
gesticulation and wild rolling of the eyes.A party seemed to be
crystallizing about him.His hitherto uncertain prestige appeared to
be soaring greatly.Men who before made slighting remarks about him,
or opposed his administrative acts, were now often seen in earnest
converse with him.His manner toward Jose and Rosendo became that of
utter contempt.He often refused to notice the priest as they passed
in the streets.It attained its climax when Rosendo
came to him one day to discuss the Alcalde's conduct and the change of
sentiment which seemed to be stealing rapidly over the hearts of the
people of Simiti."Padre," said the old man in perplexity, "I cannot say what it is, but
Don Mario has some scheme in hand, and--and I do not think it is for
our good.I cannot get anything out of those with whom he talks so
continually, but Lazaro tells me that--_Bien_, that he learns that Don
Mario suspects you of--of not belonging to the Church party."Don Mario's suspicions about him had been many and
varied, especially as La Libertad mine had not been discovered.He
said as much to Rosendo in reply; and as he did so, he thought the old
man's face took on a queer and unwonted expression."But, Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "they say that Don Mario
has word from the Bishop that you once wrote a book against the Holy
Father--"

"Good God!"The words burst from the priest's lips like the sudden
issuance of pent steam.Rosendo stared at him in bewilderment.it is what Lazaro tells me," replied the old man,
his own suspicion verging upon conviction.Jose's dark face became almost white, and his breath sobbed out in
gasps.A vague idea of the game Wenceslas was playing now stole
through his throbbing brain.That book, his Nemesis, his pursuing
Fate, had tracked him to this secluded corner of the earth, and in the
hands of the most unscrupulous politician of South America was being
used as a tool.But, precisely to what end, his wild thought did not
as yet disclose.Still, above the welter of it all, he saw clearly
that there must be no further delay on his part.Before he could
speak, however, Rosendo had resumed the conversation."Padre," he said, "had it occurred to you that you were watched, day
and night?"Don Mario's men keep you in sight during the day;
and at night there is always some one hovering near your house.You
could not escape now even if you would."Jose sank back in his chair limp and cold.His frenzied brain held but
one thought: he had delayed until too late--and the end was at hand!"Padre," said Rosendo earnestly, "tell me about that book.You have not brought Carmen up in the Church.But it was I who told
you not to--that her heart was her church, and it must not be
disturbed.But--is it true, as the people say, that you really belong
to the party that would destroy the Church?"While his heart burned within his breast,
he opened its portals and revealed to Rosendo all that lay within.Beginning with his boyhood, he drew his career out before the
wondering eyes of the old man down to the day when the culmination of
carnal ambition, false thought, perverted concepts of filial devotion
and sacredness of oath, of family honor and pride of race, had washed
him up against the dreary shores of Simiti.With no thought of
concealment, he exposed his ambition in regard to Carmen--even the
love for her that he knew must die of inanition--and ended by throwing
himself without reserve upon Rosendo's judgment.When the tense
recital was ended, Rosendo leaned over and clasped the priest's
trembling hand."I understand, Padre," he said gently."I am dull of wit, I know.And
you have often laughed at my superstitions and old family beliefs,
whether religious or otherwise.And I
shall die in the Church, and take my chances on the future, for I have
tried to live a good life.But--with a man like you--I understand.And
now, Padre, we have no time to be sorrowful.And both are
Carmen's, is it not so?Thanks be to the good Virgin," he muttered,
as he walked slowly away, "that Lazaro got those titles from Don Mario
to-day!"*       *       *       *       *

Nightfall brought an unexpected visitor in the person of Don Jorge,
who had returned from the remoter parts of the Guamoco region."_Bien_, and what news?"he called cheerily, as he strode into the
parish house, where Rosendo and Jose were in earnest conversation.Jose embraced him as a brother, while a great sense of relief stole
over him.Then he quickly made known to him the situation.He ceased his task of scraping the caked
mud from his bare limbs, and drew up a chair near Jose.But, _amigo_, lend
me a copy, for I doubt not it is most excellent reading, and will
serve to while away many a weary hour in the jungle."His eyes snapped
merrily, and he slapped Jose roundly upon the back when he finished
speaking."But," he continued more seriously, "things seem to be setting against
you, friend.However, let me but canvass the town to-morrow, and by
evening I can advise.And yet--and yet--I wonder why the Governor
sends arms here.Don Jorge needed not a full day to correctly estimate the situation in
Simiti.His bluff, hearty manner and genial good-nature constituted a
passport to every house, and by midday he had talked with nearly every
man in the _pueblo_.He called Jose and Rosendo for consultation
during the _siesta_."_Bien_," he said, when they were seated in the parish house, "Don
Mario without doubt descends from the very serpent that tempted our
mother Eve!He has become a person of considerable importance since
the Governor and Don Wenceslas strive with each other to rest their
authority and confidence in him.And, unless I mistake much, they have
him slated for important work.However that may be, the man already
has a large following.Moreover, he has them well poisoned against
you, _amigo_ Jose.They know more details about your book and your
life before coming to Simiti than do you._Bien_, you must counteract
the Alcalde's influence by a public statement.It must be to-night--in
the church!You will have to act quickly, for the old fox has you
picked for trouble!Diego's disappearance, you know; the girl, Carmen;
your rather foolish course here--it is all laid up against you,
friend, and you must meet it!"Don Jorge went out and summoned the town to a meeting
in the church that evening.Immediately Don Mario issued a mandate
forbidding a public gathering at a time of such stress.The people
began to assemble on the street corners and in front of their houses
to discuss the situation.Don Jorge was
everywhere, and none could talk so volubly nor gesticulate and
expectorate so vehemently as he.At sundown the people moved toward the _plaza_.Then the concourse
drifted slowly into the church.Don Jorge dragged Jose from the parish
house and up to the altar."You have got to divide them, Padre!""Your only hope now lies in the formation of your
own party to oppose the Alcalde!Talk to them as you never talked
before!Say all that you had stored up to say on Judgment Day!"Again, as Jose faced his little flock and saw them, bare of feet,
scantily clad in their simple cotton and calico, their faces set in
deep seriousness, the ludicrous side of the whole situation flashed
before him, and he almost laughed aloud at the spectacle which the
ancient, decayed town at that moment presented.These primitive
folk--they were but children, with all a child's simplicity of nature,
its petulance, its immaturity of view, and its sudden and unreasoning
acceptance of authority!He turned to the altar and took up a tall
brass crucifix.He held it out before him for a moment.Then he called
upon the Christ to witness to the truth of what he was about to say.Even Don Mario seemed to become calm
after that dramatic spectacle.He talked long and
earnestly.He knew not that such eloquence abode within him.His
declamation became more and more impassioned.He opened wide his heart
and called upon all present to look fearlessly within.Yes, he had
written the book in question.Yes, it had expressed his views at that time.The shadows were gathering
thick, and the smoking kerosene lamps battled vainly with the heavy
blackness.In a far corner of the room he saw Carmen and Ana.Rosendo
sat stolidly beside them.The sightless babe waved its tiny hands in
mute helplessness, while Dona Maria held it closely to her bosom.Carmen's last admonition sang in his ears.He must know--really
_know_--that the babe could see!His appeal to the people was not for himself.He cared not what
became of him.But Carmen--and now Ana and the blind babe--and the
calm, unimpassioned Dona Maria, the embodiment of all that was
greatest in feminine character--and Rosendo, waiting to lay down his
life for those he loved!And then, this people, soon, he felt, to be
shattered by the shock of war--ah, God above!what could he say that
might save them?If they could know, as Carmen did, if they could love
and trust as she did, would the hideous spectre of war ever stalk
among them?Could the world know, and love, and trust as did this fair
child, would it waste itself in useless wars, sink with famine and
pestilence, consume with the anguish of fear, and in the end bury its
blasted hopes in the dank, reeking tomb?The thought gave wings to his
voice, soul to his words.And, while the
holy hush remained upon the people, he descended the altar steps, his
frame still tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal, and went alone
to his house.CHAPTER 32


Dawn had scarcely reddened in the east when a number of men assembled
at Jose's door."You have turned the trick, _amigo_," said Don Jorge, rousing up from
his _petate_ on the floor beside the priest's bed."You have won over
a few of them, at least."Jose went out to meet the early callers."We come to say, Padre," announced Andres Arellano, the dignified
spokesman, "that we have confidence in your words of last night.We
suspect Don Mario, even though he has letters from the Bishop.We are
your men, and we would keep the war away from Simiti."There were five of them, strong of heart and brawny of arm."And there
will be more, Padre," added Andres, reading the priest's question in
his appraising glance.Thus was the town divided; and while many clung to the Alcalde, partly
through fear of offending the higher ecclesiastical authority, and
partly because of imagined benefits to be gained, others, and a goodly
number, assembled at Jose's side, and looked to him to lead them in
the crisis which all felt to be at hand.As the days passed, the
priest's following grew more numerous, until, after the lapse of a
week, the town stood fairly divided.Don Jorge announced his intention
of remaining in Simiti for the present.From the night of the meeting in the church excitement ran continuously
higher.Business was at length suspended; the fishermen forgot their
nets; and the limber tongues of the town gossips steadily increased
their clatter.Don Mario's store and _patio_ assumed the functions of
a departmental office.Daily he might be seen laboriously drafting
letters of incredible length and wearisome prolixity to acting-Bishop
Wenceslas; and nightly he was engaged in long colloquies and whispered
conferences with Don Luis and others of his followers and hangers-on.The government arms had been brought up from Bodega Central and stored
in an empty warehouse belonging to Don Felipe Alcozer to await further
disposition.But with the arrival of the arms, and of certain letters which Don
Mario received from Cartagena, the old town lost its calm of
centuries, not to recover it again for many a dreary day.By the time
its peace was finally restored, it had received a blow from which it
never recovered.And many a familiar face, too, had disappeared
forever from its narrow streets.Meanwhile, Jose and his followers anxiously awaited the turn of
events.It came at length, and in a manner not wholly unexpected.The
Alcalde in his voluminous correspondence with Wenceslas had not
failed to bring against Jose every charge which his unduly stimulated
brain could imagine.But in particular did he dwell upon the
priest's malign influence upon Carmen, whose physical beauty and
powers of mind were the marvel of Simiti.He hammered upon this
with an insistence that could not but at length again attract the
thought of the acting-Bishop, who wrote finally to Don Mario,
expressing the mildly couched opinion that, now that his attention
had been called again to the matter, Carmen should have the benefits
of the education and liberal training which a convent would afford.Don Mario's egotism soared to the sky.The great Bishop was actually
being advised by him!He would yet
remove to a larger town, perhaps Mompox, and, with the support of the
great ecclesiastic, stand for election to Congress!He would show the
Bishop what mettle he had in him.And first he would show
His Grace how a loyal servant could anticipate his master's wishes.He
summoned Fernando, and imperiously bade him bring the girl Carmen at
once.But Fernando returned, saying that Rosendo refused to give up the
child.But Fernando found it
impossible to execute the commission.Jose and Don Jorge stood with
Rosendo, and threatened to deal harshly with the constable should he
attempt to take Carmen by force.Fernando then sought to impress upon
the Alcalde the danger of arousing public opinion again over the
girl.Don Mario's wrath burst forth like an exploding bomb.He seized his
straw hat and his cane, the emblem of his office, and strode to the
house of Rosendo.His face grew more deeply purple as he went.At the
door of the house he encountered Jose and Don Jorge."Don Mario," began Jose, before the Alcalde could get his words
shaped, "it is useless.Be advised, Don Mario, for the consequences of
thoughtless action may be incalculable!"bellowed the irate official, "but, cow-face!do you know
that His Grace supports me?if you do not at once deliver to me your paramour--"

He got no further.Rosendo, who had been standing just within the
door, suddenly pushed Jose and Don Jorge aside and, stalking out, a
tower of flesh, confronted the raging Alcalde.For a moment he gazed
down into the pig-eyes of the man.Then, with a quick thrust of his
thick arm, he projected his huge fist squarely into Don Mario's
bloated face.Neither Jose nor Don Jorge, as they rushed in between Rosendo and his
fallen adversary, had any adequate idea of the consequences of the old
man's precipitate action.As they assisted the prostrate official to
his unsteady feet they knew not that to Rosendo, simple, peace-loving,
and great of heart, had fallen the lot to inaugurate hostilities in
the terrible anticlerical war which now for four dismal years was to
tear Colombia from end to end, and leave her prostrate and exhausted
at last, her sons decimated, her farms and industries ruined, and her
neck beneath the heavy heel of a military despot at Bogota, whose
pliant hand would still be guided by the astute brain of Rome.By the time the startled Alcalde had been set again upon his feet a
considerable concourse had gathered at the scene.Many stood in
wide-eyed horror at what had just occurred.The crowd rapidly grew, and in a few minutes the _plaza_
was full.Supporters of both sides declaimed and gesticulated
vehemently.In the heat of the arguments a blow was struck.The Alcalde, when he found his tongue, shrilly demanded the
arrest of Rosendo and his family, including the priest and Don Jorge.A dozen of his party rushed forward to execute the order.Rosendo had
slipped between Jose and Don Jorge and into his house.In a trice he
emerged with a great _machete_.His
eyes blazed like live coals, and his breath seemed to issue from his
dilating nostrils like clouds of steam.Don Jorge crept behind him and, gaining the house, collected
the terrified women and held them in readiness for flight.Juan,
Lazaro, and a number of others surrounded Jose and faced the angry
multitude.The strain was broken by the frenzied Alcalde, who rushed toward
Rosendo.The old man swung his enormous _machete_ with a swirl that,
had it met the official, would have clean decapitated him.But,
fortunately, one of the priest's supporters threw out his foot, and
the corpulent Alcalde fell heavily over it and bit the dust.The old man staggered with the shock and
gave way.Holding up both
hands high above his head, he sent out his voice clear and loud.The
blessed Virgin--"

"What know you of the blessed Virgin, priest of Satan?"shouted a
rough follower of the Alcalde.Julio Gomez stooped and took up a large piece of shale.He threw it
with all his force, just as the priest again strove to make his voice
heard above the din.The jagged
stone cut deeply, and the red blood spurted.Jose fell into the arms
of Lazaro and was dragged into the house.Then Rosendo, with a mad yell, plunged wildly into the crowd.A dozen
arms sought to hold him, but in vain.Julio saw the terrifying
apparition hurtling down upon him.He turned and fled, but not before
the great knife had caught him on its point as it swung down and
ripped a deep gash the full length of his naked back.Then the last vestige of reason fled from the mob, and chaos took the
reins.Back and forth through the _plaza_, in front of the church
where hung the image of the Prince of Peace, the maddened people
surged, fighting like demons, raining blows with clubs, fists, and
_machetes_, stabbing with their long, wicked knives, hurling sharp
stones, gouging, ripping, yelling, shrieking, calling upon Saints and
Virgin to curse their enemies and bless their blows.Over the heads of
them all towered the mighty frame of Rosendo.Back before his
murderous _machete_ fell the terrified combatants.His course among
them was that of a cannon ball.Dozens hung upon his arms, his
shoulders, or flung themselves about his great legs.His huge body,
slippery and reeking, was galvanized into energy incarnate.Sparks
seemed to flash from his eyes.Behind him, following in the swath which he cut, his supporters
crowded, fought and yelled.They cursed,
broke, and fled.Then Don Jorge, a man whose mortal strength was more
than common, threw himself upon the steaming, frenzied Rosendo and
stopped his mad progress.They are fleeing to the _bodega_
to get the rifles and ammunition!Come--_Dios arriba_!Cut, bruised, and dripping blood from a dozen wounds, Rosendo stood
for a moment blinking in confusion.A score lay on the ground about
him.Whether dead or wounded, he knew not, nor cared.The sight of Don
Mario's supporters in full flight fascinated him.It sounded like the gloating of an imp of Satan.Then the
force of Don Jorge's words smote him.cried Don Jorge, pulling him toward the
house.Those of the priest's other followers who were still whole
scattered wildly to their homes and barred their doors.There they
searched for knives, _machetes_, razors, any tool or instrument that
might be pressed into service as a weapon, and stood guard.One
frenzied fellow, the sole possessor of an antiquated shotgun,
projected the rusty arm from a hole in the wall of his mud hut and
blazed away down the deserted street indiscriminately and without
aim.Within the house Juan and Lazaro were supporting the dazed Jose, while
Dona Maria bathed and bound his wound.Carmen stood gazing upon the
scene in bewilderment.The precipitousness of the affair had taken her
breath away and driven all thought in mad rout from her mind.panted Don Jorge, "the church--it is the only place now
that is even fairly safe!Dona Maria, do you collect all the food in
the house!We know not how long we may be prisoners--"

"But--Don Jorge," interrupted Jose feebly, "they will attack us even
there!Let us flee--"

"Where, _amigo_?they would shoot us
down in cold blood!That
will hold some of them back, at any rate!And none of them, if they
get crazed with _anisado_!cried Rosendo, starting for the door, "but do you, Juan
and Lazaro, follow me with your _machetes_, and we will drive the
cowards from the _bodega_ and get the rifles ourselves!"By this time they have broken open the boxes
and loaded the guns.A shot--and it would be all over with you!But in
the church--you have a chance there!"Don Jorge seized his arm and dragged him out of the house and across
the deserted _plaza_.Juan and Lazaro helped Dona Maria gather what
food and water remained in the house; and together they hurried out
and over to the church.Swinging open the heavy wooden doors, they
entered and made them fast again.Then they sank upon the benches and
strove to realize their situation.Juan and Lazaro hurried to them and swung the wooden shutters.muttered Rosendo, seizing a bench and with one blow of
his _machete_ splitting it clean through, "these will make props to
hold them!"It was the work of but a few minutes to place benches across the thick
shutters and secure them with others placed diagonally against them
and let into the hard dirt floor.Then the little group huddled together and waited.Jose heard a sob
beside him, and a hand clutched his in the gloom.In
the excitement of the hour he had all but forgotten her.Through his
present confusion of thought a great fact loomed: as the girl clung to
him she was weeping!A low rumble drifted to them; a confusion of voices, growing louder;
and then a sharp report."They are coming, Padre," muttered Rosendo."And some one has tried
his rifle!"A moment later the ruck poured into the _plaza_ and made for Rosendo's
house.Don Mario, holding his cane aloft like a sword, was at their
head.Raging with disappointment at not finding the fugitives in the
house, they threw the furniture and kitchen utensils madly about,
punched great holes through the walls, and then rushed pellmell to the
parish house next door.A groan escaped Jose as he watched them
through a chink in the shutters.But as the howling mob streamed toward the parish house a wrinkled
old crone shrilled at them from across the way and pointed toward the
church."In there, _amigos_!"Shoot
them--they have hurt my Pedro!"Back like a huge wave the crowd flowed, and up against the church
doors.Don Mario, at the head of his valiant followers, held up his
hand for silence.Then, planting himself before the main doors of the
church, he loudly voiced his authority."In the name of the Government at Bogota!"he cried pompously, tapping
the doors with his light cane."Fernando," he
called, "run to my house and fetch the drum!"Despite the seriousness of their situation, Jose smiled at the
puppet-show being enacted without.The Alcalde reiterated his demands with truculent vanity."_Caramba!_ if I but had him in here alone!"Then, as no response came from within,
his anger began to soar."_Caramba!_" he cried, "but you defy the
law?"Angry mutterings rose from the crowd.A third intimated
that shooting them full of holes were better.This idea, once voiced,
spread like an infection.The childish people were eager to try the
rifles.The Alcalde threw himself heavily up against the doors."_Caramba!_"
he shrilled.Open!--or it will be the worse for you!"Jose decided that their silence should no longer exasperate the angry
man.He put his mouth to the crevice between the doors."Don Mario," he cried, "this is sacred ground!We may
settle this trouble amicably, if you will but listen to reason."The Alcalde jumped up and down in his towering wrath.he
screamed, "but I am the law--I am the Government!A curse upon you,
priest of Satan!"And if you attack us you attack the Church!"_Amigos!_ _Muchachos!_" he bawled, turning to
the mob, "we will batter down the doors!"Again and
again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors.They bent, they
sagged, but they held.A torrent of
anathemas streamed from his thick lips.some one shouted, recovering a portion of his scant
wit."Aye--and the door of the _sacristia_!"Round the building streamed the crazed mob, without head, without
reason, lusting only for the lives of the frightened little band
huddled together in the gloom within.Ana bent sobbing over her tiny babe.Don Jorge and Rosendo remained
mute and grim.Jose knew that those two would cast a long reckoning
before they died.Juan and Lazaro went from door to window, steadying
the props and making sure that they were holding.The tough, hard,
tropical wood, though pierced in places by _comjejen_ ants, was
resisting.The sun was already high, and the _plaza_ had become a furnace.The
patience of the mob quickly evaporated in the ardent heat.Don Mario's
wits had gone completely.Revenge, mingled with insensate zeal to
manifest the authority which he believed his intercourse with
Wenceslas had greatly augmented, had driven all rationality from his
motives.Flaming anger had unseated his reason.Descending from the
platform on which stood the church, he blindly drew up his armed
followers and bade them fire upon the church doors.If Wenceslas, acting-Bishop by the grace of political machination,
could have witnessed the stirring drama then in progress in ancient
Simiti, he would have laughed aloud at the complete fulfillment of his
carefully wrought plans.The cunning of the shrewd, experienced
politician had never been more clearly manifested than in the carrying
out of the little program which he had set for the unwise Alcalde of
this almost unknown little town, whereby the hand of Congress should
be forced and the inevitable revolt inaugurated.Don Mario had seized
the government arms, the deposition of which in Simiti in his care had
constituted him more than ever the representative of federal
authority.But, in his wild zeal, he had fallen into the trap which
Wenceslas had carefully arranged for him, and now was engaged in a mad
attack upon the Church itself, upon ecclesiastical authority as vested
in the priest Jose.How could Wenceslas interpret this but as an
anticlerical uprising?And while
the soft-headed dupes and maniacal supporters of Don Mario were
hurling bullets into the thick doors of the old church in Simiti,
Wenceslas sat musing in his comfortable study in the cathedral of
Cartagena, waiting with what patience he could command for further
reports from Don Mario, whose last letter had informed him that the
arrest of the priest Jose and his unfortunate victim, Carmen, was only
a few hours off.When the first shots rang out, and the bullets ploughed into the hard
wood of the heavy doors, Jose's heart sank, and he gave himself up as
lost.Lazaro and Juan cowered upon the floor.Carmen crept close to
Jose, as he sat limply upon a bench, and put her arms about him."Padre dear," she whispered, "it isn't true--it isn't true!They don't
really want to kill us!The recriminating thought
flashed over him that he alone was the cause of this.He had
sacrificed them all--none but he was to blame.if he
could only offer himself to satiate the mob's lust, and save these
innocent ones!Lurid, condemnatory thoughts burned through his brain
like molten iron.Rosendo and
Don Jorge seized him as he was about to lift a prop."I am going out, friends--I shall give myself to them for you all.Let them have me, if they
will spare you!"But the firing had ceased, and Don Mario was approaching the door."Myself for the others, Don Mario!""But promise to spare them--but give me your word--and I
will yield myself to arrest!""It is not
you that the good Bishop wants, but the girl!I have his letters
demanding that I send her to him!If you will come out, you shall not
be hurt.Only, Rosendo must stand trial for the harm he did in the
fight this morning; and the girl must go to Cartagena.As for the rest
of you, you will be free."Juan and Lazaro," he said, "we will open a window quickly in
the rear of the church and let you out.It is not right that you
should die with us.And Don Jorge, too--"

"Stop there, _amigo!_" interrupted the latter in a voice as cold as
steel."My life has not the value of a white heron.Can I do better
than give it for a cause that I know to be right?Nay, man, I remain
with you.Let the lads go, if they will--"

Lazaro forced himself between Don Jorge and the priest."Padre," he
said quietly, "to you I owe what I am.The boy's eyes were fixed on
Carmen.He turned and gazed for a moment at a window, as if hesitating
between two decisions."Padre," he
said, though his voice trembled, "I, too, remain."The Alcalde received his answer with a burst of inarticulate rage.He
rushed back to his followers with his arms waving wildly._Compadres_, get
the poles and burst in the shutters._Caramba!_ it is the Government
they are defying!"A bullet pierced the wall and whizzed past Carmen.Jose seized the girl and drew her down under a bench.The startled
bats among the roof beams fluttered wildly about through the heavy
gloom.Frightened rats scurried around the altar.The rusty bell in
the tower cried out as if in protest against the sacrilege.Juan burst
into tears and crept beneath a bench."Padre," said Rosendo, "it is only a question of time when the doors
will fall._Bien_, let us place
the women back of the altar, while we men stand here at one side of
the doors, so that when they fall we may dash out and cut our way
through the crowd.If we throw ourselves suddenly upon them, we may
snatch away a rifle or two.Then Don Jorge and I, with the lads here,
may drive them back--perhaps beat them!But my first blow shall be for
Don Mario!I vow here that, if I escape this place, he shall not live
another hour!""Better so, Rosendo, than that they should take us alive.Do we leave her to fall into Don Mario's hands?"Rosendo's voice, low and cold, froze the marrow in the priest's bones."Padre, she will not fall into the Alcalde's hands."Rosendo, do you--"

A piercing cry checked him.Padre--!_" Lazaro had
collapsed upon the floor."Padre--I confess--pray for
me.He struggled to lay a hand upon his bleeding
breast."To the altar, _amigos_!"cried Don Jorge, ducking his head as a
bullet sang close to it.Seizing the expiring Lazaro, they hurriedly dragged him down the aisle
and took refuge back of the brick altar.The bullets, now piercing the
walls of the church with ease, whizzed about them.One struck the
pendant figure of the Christ, and it fell crashing to the floor.Rosendo stood in horror, as if he expected a miracle to follow this
act of sacrilege.prayed Jose, "only Thy hand can save us!""He will save us, Padre--He will!"cried Carmen, creeping closer to
him through the darkness."Padre," said Don Jorge hurriedly, "the Host--is it on the altar?""Then, when the doors fall, do you stand in front of the altar,
holding it aloft and calling on the people to stand back, lest the
hand of God strike them!""It is a chance--yes, a bare chance.They will
stop before it--or they will kill me!Carmen's
voice broke clear and piercing through the din.Jose struggled to free
himself from her."_Na_, Padre," interposed Rosendo, "it may be better so!Heavy poles and billets of wood had been
fetched, and blow after blow now fell upon every shutter and door.The
sharp spitting of the rifles tore the air, and bullets crashed through
the walls and windows.In the heavy shadows back of the altar Rosendo
and Don Jorge crouched over the sobbing women.Jose knew as he stretched out a hand through the darkness and touched
the cold face that the faithful spirit had fled.How soon his own
would follow he knew not, nor cared.Keeping close to the floor, he
crept out and around to the front of the altar.Reaching up, he
grasped the Sacred Host, and then stood upright, holding it out before
him.Carmen rose by his side and took his hand.Rosendo's hoarse whisper drifted across the silence like a wraith.He
crept out and along the floor, scarce daring to look up.Through the
darkness his straining eyes caught the outlines of the two figures
standing like statues before the altar."_Loado sea Dios!_" he cried, and his voice broke with a sob."But,
Padre, they have stopped--what has happened?"We are in the hands of God--"

"Padre--listen!"Carmen darted from the altar and ran to the door.All was quiet without, but for
an animated conversation between Don Mario and some strangers who had
evidently just arrived upon the scene.One of the latter was speaking
with the Alcalde in excellent Spanish.Another, evidently unacquainted
with the language, made frequent interruptions in the English tongue."Say, Reed," said the voice in English, "tell the parchment-faced old
buzzard that we appreciate the little comedy he has staged for us.Tell him it is bully-bueno, but he must not overdo it.We are plum
done up, and want a few days of rest.""What says the senor, _amigo_?"asked Don Mario, with his utmost
suavity and unction of manner."He says," returned the other in Spanish, "that he is delighted with
the firmness which you display in the administration of your office,
and that he trusts the bandits within the church may be speedily
executed."They are those who
defy the Government as represented by myself!"He straightened up and
threw out his chest with such an exhibition of importance that the
strangers with difficulty kept their faces straight.Carmen and Jose looked at each other in amazement during this
colloquy."Do all who speak English tell such
lies?"murmured the one addressed as Reed, directing himself to the
Alcalde, "how dared they!But, senor, my friend and I have come to
your beautiful city on business of the utmost importance, in which
you doubtless will share largely.I would suggest," looking with
amusement at the array of armed men about him, "that your prisoners
are in no immediate likelihood of escaping, and you might leave them
under close guard while we discuss our business.A--a--we hear
reports, senor, that there is likely to be trouble in the country, and
we are desirous of getting out as soon as possible."Cierto, senores!_" exclaimed Don Mario, bowing low.Turning to the gaping people, he selected
several to do guard duty, dismissed the others, and then bade the
strangers follow him to his house, which, he declared vehemently, was
theirs as long as they might honor him with their distinguished
presence.The sudden turn of events left the little group within the church in a
maze of bewilderment.They drew together in the center of the room and
talked in low whispers until the sun dropped behind the hills and
night drifted through the quiet streets.Late that evening came a
tapping at the rear door of the church, and a voice called softly to
the priest.Jose roused out of his gloomy revery and hastened to
answer it.I am on guard; but no one must know that I
talk with you.But--Padre, if you open the door and escape, I will not
see you.I am sorry, Padre, but it could not be helped.Don Mario has
us all frightened, for the Bishop--"

"True, _amigo_," returned Jose; "but the strangers who arrived this
afternoon--who are they, and whence?""Two _Americanos_, Padre, and miners.""Fernando--you would aid me?_Bien_, get word
to the stranger who speaks both English and Spanish.Bring him here,
secretly, and stand guard yourself while I talk with him.""Gladly, Padre," returned the penitent fellow, as he hastened quietly
away.An hour later Jose was again roused by Fernando tapping on the door.Fear not; only the _Americano_ will enter.Jose lifted the prop and swung the door open.Rosendo stood with
uplifted _machete_.Jose
quickly closed the door, and then addressed him in English.exclaimed the stranger in a mellow voice."I had no
idea I should find any one in this God-forsaken town who could speak
real United States!"Jose drew him into the _sacristia_.Neither man could see the other in
the dense blackness."Tell me, friend," began Jose, "who you are, and where you come
from.""Reed--Charles Reed--New York--mining engineer--down here to examine
the so-called mines of the Molino Company, now gasping its last while
awaiting our report.Arrived this afternoon from Badillo with my
partner, fellow named Harris.you certainly
were in a stew when we appeared!Even if we passed the guard, where would we
go?There are two women, a girl, and a babe with us.Should we gain the Boque or Guamoco trail, we would
be pursued and shot down.There is a chance here--none in flight!Reed," continued Jose earnestly, "will you get word from
me to the Bishop in Cartagena that our church has been attacked--that
its priest is besieged by the Alcalde, and his life in jeopardy?"Your _bogas_
have not returned to Badillo?""No, they are staying here for the big show.Execution of the
traitors, you know.""Then, friend, send them at dawn to Bodega Central.Let them take a
message to be sent by the telegraph from that place.Tell the
Bishop--"

"Sure!"I'll fix up a message
that will bring him by return boat!I've been talking with the
Honorable Alcalde and I've got his exact number.Say, he certainly is
the biggest damn--beg pardon; I mean, the biggest numbskull I have
ever run across--and that's saying considerable for a mining man!"said Jose, making no other reply to the man's words."Go
quickly--and use what influence you have with the Alcalde to save us.We have women here--and a young girl!"He found the American's hand
and led him out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas Ortiz stood before the Departmental Governor.His face was
deeply serious, and his demeanor expressed the utmost gravity.In his
hand he held a despatch.The Governor sat at his desk, nervously
fumbling a pen."_Bien, Senor_," said Wenceslas quietly, "do you act--or shall I take
it to His Excellency, the President?"The Governor moved uneasily in his chair."_Caramba!_" he blurted out.And yet, I cannot see but that the Alcalde
acted wholly within his rights!""Your Excellency, he seizes government arms--he attacks the church--he
attempts to destroy the life of its priest.Nominally acting for the
Government; at heart, anticlerical.Will the
Government clear itself now of the suspicion which this has aroused?""But the priest--did you not say only last week that he himself had
published a book violently anticlerical in tone?""Senor, we will not discuss the matter further," said Wenceslas,
moving toward the door."Your final decision--you will send troops to
Simiti, or no?"Wenceslas courteously bowed himself out.Once beyond the door, he
breathed a great sigh of relief."_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, "but I
took a chance!Had he yielded and sent troops, all would have been
spoiled.He entered his carriage and was driven hurriedly to his _sanctum_.There he despatched a long message to the President of the Republic.He mused over it for the space of an hour."Your Excellency," it read, "the
Church supports the Administration."Late that evening a second message from Bogota was put into his hand.He tore it open and read, "The Hercules ordered to Simiti.""Ah," he sighed, sinking into his chair.A message to
the captain of the Hercules to bring me that girl!"*       *       *       *       *

"Well, old man, I've done all I could to stave off the blundering
idiot; but I guess you are in for it!The jig is up, I'm thinking!"Simiti again slept, while the American and Jose
in the _sacristia_ talked long and earnestly.Fernando kept guard at
the door."Your message went down the river two days ago," continued Reed.since then I've racked my dusty brain for topics to keep
the Alcalde occupied and forgetful of you.But I'm dryer than a desert
now; and he vows that to-morrow you and your friends will be dragged
out of this old shack by your necks, and then shot."The two days had been filled with exquisite torture for Jose.Only the
presence of Carmen restrained him from rushing out and ending it all.Every hour, every moment, she
knew only the immanence of her God; whereas he, obedient to the
undulating Rincon character-curve, expressed the mutability of his
faith in hourly alternations of optimism and black despair.After
periods of exalted hope, stimulated by the girl's sublime confidence,
there would come the inevitable backward rush of all the chilling
fear, despondency, and false thought which he had just expelled in
vain, and he would be left again floundering helplessly in the dismal
labyrinth of terrifying doubts.The quiet which enwrapped them during these days of imprisonment; the
gloom-shrouded church; the awed hush that lay upon them in the
presence of the dead Lazaro, stimulated the feeble and sensitive
spirit of the priest to an unwonted degree of introspection, and he
sat for hours gazing blankly into the ghastly emptiness of his past.He saw how at the first, when Carmen entered his life with the
stimulus of her buoyant faith, there had seemed to follow an emptying
of self, a quick clearing of his mentality, and a replacement of much
of the morbid thought, which clung limpet-like to his mentality, by
new and wonderfully illuminating ideas.For a while he had seemed to
be on the road to salvation; he felt that he had touched the robe of
the Christ, and heavenly virtue had entered into his being.But then the shadows began to gather once more.He did not cling to
the new truths and spiritual ideas tenaciously enough to work them out
in demonstration.He had proved shallow soil, whereon the seed had
fallen, only to be choked by the weeds which grew apace therein.The
troubles which clustered thick about him after his first few months in
Simiti had seemed to hamper his freer limbs, and check his upward
progress.Constant conflict with Diego, with Don Mario, and Wenceslas;
the pressure from his mother and his uncle, had kept him looking, now
at evil, now at good, giving life and power to each in turn, and
wrestling incessantly with the false concepts which his own mentality
kept ever alive.Worrying himself free from one set of human beliefs,
he fell again into the meshes of others.Though he thought he knew the
truth--though he saw it lived and demonstrated by Carmen--he had yet
been afraid to throw himself unreservedly upon his convictions.And so
he daily paid the dire penalty which error failed not to exact.But Carmen, the object of by far the greater part of all his anxious
thought, had moved as if in response to a beckoning hand that remained
invisible to him.And each
day, too, she had seemed to draw farther away from him, as she
rose steadily out of the limited encompassment in which they
dwelt.Not by conscious design did she appear to separate from him,
but inevitably, because of his own narrow capacity for true
spiritual intercourse with such a soul as hers.He shared her
ideals; he had sought in his way to attain them; he had striven,
too, to comprehend her spirit, which in his heart he knew to be a
bright reflection of the infinite Spirit which is God.But as the
years passed he had found his efforts to be like her more and more
clumsy and blundering, and his responses to her spiritual demands less
and less vigorous.At times he seemed to catch glimpses of her
soul that awed him.At others he would feel himself half inclined
to share the people's belief that she was possessed of powers
occult.And then he would sink into despair of ever understanding the
girl--for he knew that to do so he must be like her, even as to
understand God we must become like Him.After her fourteenth birthday Jose found himself rapidly ceasing to
regard Carmen as a mere child.Not that she did not still often
seem delightfully immature, when her spirits would flow wildly, and
she would draw him into the frolics which had yielded her such
extravagant joy in former days; but that the growth of knowledge and
the rapid development of her thought had seemed to bring to her a
deepening sense of responsibility, a growing impression of maturity,
and an increasing regard for the meaning of life and her part in
it.She had ceased to insist that she would never leave Simiti.And
Jose often thought of late, as he watched her, that he detected
signs of irksomeness at the limitations which her environment
imposed upon her.But, if so, these were never openly expressed; nor
did her manner ever change toward her foster-parents, or toward the
simple and uncomprehending folk of her native town.From the first, Jose had constituted himself her teacher, guide, and
protector.His soured and
rebellious nature had been no barrier to her great love, which had
twined about his heart like ivy around a crumbling tower.And his love
for the child had swelled like a torrent, fed hourly by countless
uncharted streams.He had watched over her like a father; he had
rejoiced to see her bloom into a beauty as rich and luxuriant as the
tropical foliage; he had gazed for hours into the unsearchable abyss
of her black eyes and read there, in ecstasy, a wondrous response to
his love; and when, but a few short days ago, she had again intimated
a future union, a union upon which, even as a child, she had insisted,
yet one which he knew--had always known--utterly, extravagantly
impossible--he had, nevertheless, seized upon the thought with a joy
that was passionate, desperate--and had then flung it from him with a
cry of agony.It was not the disparity of ages; it was not the girl's
present immaturity.In less than a year she would have attained the
marriageable age of these Latin countries.But he could wait two,
three, aye, ten years for such a divine gift!No; the shadow which lay
upon his life was cast by the huge presence of the master whose chains
he wore, the iron links of which, galling his soul, he knew to be
unbreakable.And, as he sat in the gloom of the decayed old church
where he was now a prisoner, the thought that his situation but
symbolized an imprisonment in bonds eternal roused him to a
half-frenzied resolve to destroy himself."Padre dear," the girl had whispered to him that night, just before
the American came again with his disquieting report, "Love will open
the door--Love will set us free.Remember, Paul
thanked God for freedom even while he sat in chains.And I am just as
thankful as he."Jose knew as he kissed her tenderly and bade her go to her place of
rest on the bench beside Dona Maria that death stood between her and
the stained hand of Wenceslas Ortiz.As morning reddened in the eastern sky Don Mario, surrounded by an
armed guard and preceded by his secretary, who beat lustily upon a
small drum, marched pompously down the main street and across the
_plaza_ to the church.Holding his cane aloft he ascended the steps of
the platform and again loudly demanded the surrender of the prisoners
within."The same," reiterated the Alcalde vigorously."Then we will die, Don Mario," he replied sadly, moving
away from the door and leading his little band of harried followers to
the rear of the altar.The Alcalde quickly descended the steps and shouted numerous orders.Several of his men hurried off in various directions, while those
remaining at once opened fire upon the church.In a few moments the
firing was increased, and the entire attack was concentrated upon the
front doors.Shouts and curses filled the morning
air.But it was evident to Jose that his besiegers were meeting with
no opposition from his own supporters in the fight of two days before.The sight of the deadly rifles in the hands of Don Mario's party had
quickly quenched their loyalty to Jose, and led them basely to abandon
him and his companions to their fate.After a few minutes of vigorous assault the attack abruptly ceased,
and Jose was called again to the door."It's Reed," came the American's voice."I've
persuaded the old carrion to let me have a moment's pow-wow with you.Say, give the old buzzard what he wants.Otherwise it's sure death for
you all.I've argued myself sick with him, but he's as set as
concrete.I'll do what I can for you if you come out; but he's going
to have the girl, whether or no.Seems that the Bishop of Cartagena
wants her; and the old crow here is playing politics with him.""Yes, old man," chimed in another voice, which Jose knew to be that of
Harris."You know these fellows are hell on politics."Then to Jose, "What'll I tell the old
duffer?"ejaculated Harris, "if I had a couple of Mausers I could
put these ancient Springfields on the bum in a hurry!""Tell him, friend, that we are prepared to die," replied Jose
drearily, as he turned back into the gloom and took Carmen's hand.The final assault began, and Jose knew that it was only a question of
minutes when the trembling doors would fall.He crouched with his
companions behind the altar, awaiting the inevitable."Love will save us, Padre," she whispered.They don't know what is using them--and it has no power!Rosendo bent over and whispered to Don Jorge, "When the doors fall and
the men rush in, stand you here with me!When they reach the altar we
will throw ourselves upon them, I first, you following, while Juan
will bring Carmen and try to protect her.With our _machetes_ we will
cut our way out.If we find that it is hopeless--then give me
Carmen!"A moment later, as with a loud wail, the two front doors burst asunder
and fell crashing to the floor.A flood of golden sunlight poured into
the dark room.In its yellow wake rushed the mob, with exultant yells.Rosendo rose quickly and placed himself at the head of his little
band.But, ere the first of the frenzied besiegers had crossed the threshold
of the church, a loud cry arose in the _plaza_.Down the main thoroughfare came a volley of shots.Don Mario, half way
through the church door, froze in his tracks.Those of his followers
who had entered, turned quickly and made pellmell for the exit.Their
startled gaze met a company of federal troops rushing down the street,
firing as they came.But the doors were prone upon the floor,
and could not be replaced.Then he and his men scrambled out and
rushed around to one side of the building.As the soldiers came
running up, the Alcalde's followers fired point blank into their
faces, then dropped their guns and fled precipitately.Within an hour staid old Simiti lay in the
grip of martial law, with its once overweening Alcalde, now a meek and
frightened prisoner, arraigned before Captain Morales, holding court
in the shabby town hall.But the court-martial was wholly perfunctory.Though none there but
himself knew it, the captain had come with the disposal of the
unfortunate Don Mario prearranged.A perfunctory hearing of witnesses,
which but increased his approval of his orders, and he pronounced
sentence upon the former Alcalde, and closed the case."Attack upon the church--Assassination of the man Lazaro--Firing upon
federal soldiers--To be shot at sunset, senor," he concluded
solemnly.I was ordered by him to do
it!""_Bien_, senor," replied the captain, whose heart was not wholly
devoid of pity, "produce your letters.""_Senor Capitan_," interposed Jose, "may I plead for the man?He
is--"

"There, Padre," returned the captain, holding up a hand, "it is
useless.Doubtless this has been brought about by motives which you do
not understand.You have a _carcel_
here?_Bien_," addressing his lieutenant, "remove the prisoner to it,
and at sunset let the sentence be carried out."Don Mario, screaming with fear, was dragged from the room."And now, senores," continued the captain calmly, as if nothing out of
the ordinary had occurred, "I appoint Don Fernando, former secretary,
as temporary Alcalde, until such time as the Governor may fill the
office permanently.And," he continued, looking about the room with a
heavy scowl, while the timid people shrank against the wall, "as for
those misguided ones who took part with Don Mario in this anticlerical
uprising--his fate will serve, I think, as a warning!"A hush of horror lay upon the stunned people as they filed slowly out
of the room."_Bien_," added the captain, addressing Fernando, "quarters for my
men, and rations.And let all
arms and ammunition be collected.And we
shall want _peones_ to carry it to the river."Jose turned away, sick with the horror of it all.A soldier approached
him with a message from Don Mario.The condemned man was asking for
the last rites.Faint and trembling, the priest accompanied the
messenger to the jail.wailed the terrified and bewildered Don Mario.Don Wenceslas--"

"Yes, I understand, Don Mario," interrupted Jose, tenderly taking the
man's hand."Yes, Padre," sobbed the unfortunate victim."He said that I would be
rich--that I would be elected to Congress--ah, the traitor!And,
Padre--I burned his letters because it was his wish!Ah, _Santa
Virgen_!"He put his head on the priest's shoulder and wept
violently.Jose's heart was wrung; but he was powerless to aid the man.And yet,
as he dwelt momentarily on his own sorrows, he almost envied the fate
which had overtaken the misguided Don Mario."_Senor Padre_," he said, "the sun is low.In
a quarter of an hour--"

Don Mario sank to the ground and clasped the priest's knees.Jose held
up his hand, and the lieutenant, bowing courteously, withdrew.The
priest knelt beside the cowering prisoner."Don Mario," he said gently, holding the man's hand, "confess all to
me.It may be the means of saving other lives--and then you will have
expiated your own crimes.""Padre," moaned the stricken man, rocking back and forth, his head
buried in his hands and tears streaming through his fingers, "Padre,
you will forgive--?"But remove now the last burden from your soul--the guilty
knowledge of the part Don Wenceslas has had in the disaster which has
come upon Simiti.Tell it all, friend, for you may save many precious
lives thereby."The fallen Alcalde roused himself by a mighty effort.Forgetting for
the moment his own dire predicament, he opened his heart.Jose sat
before him in wide-mouthed astonishment.Don Mario's confession
brought a revelation that left him cold.Then, to Don Mario: "And Carmen?"Don Mario leaned close to the priest and whispered low."No, she is
not Diego's child!And, Padre, take her away, at once!There is not an inch of ground in all Colombia now where she
would be safe from Don Wenceslas!"Then he again took Don Mario's
hand."Friend," he said gravely, "rest assured, what you have told me saves
at least one life, and removes the sin with which your own was
stained.And now," rising and turning to the waiting lieutenant, "we
are ready."Santa Virgen, San Salvador, ora pro
nobis!_

A few minutes later a sharp report echoed through the Simiti valley
and startled the herons that were seeking their night's rest on the
wooded isle.Then Jose de Rincon, alone, and with a heart of lead,
moved slowly down through the dreary village and crossed the deserted
_plaza_ to his lowly abode.CHAPTER 34


The low-hung moon, shrouded in heavy vapor, threw an eldritch shimmer
upon the little group that silently bore the body of the martyred
Lazaro from the old church late that night to the dreary cemetery on
the hill.Jose took but a reluctant part in the proceedings.He would
even have avoided this last service to his faithful friend if he
could.It seemed to him as he stumbled along the stony road behind the
body which Rosendo and Don Jorge carried that his human endurance had
been strained so far beyond the elastic limit that there could now be
no rebound.Every thought that touched his sore mind made it bleed
anew, for every thought that he accepted was acrid, rasping,
oppressive.The sheer weight of foreboding, of wild apprehension, of
paralyzing fear, crushed him, until his shoulders bent low as he
walked.How, lest he perform a miracle, could he hope to extricate
himself and his loved ones from the meshes of the net, far-cast, but
with unerring aim, which had fallen upon them?As he passed the town hall he saw through the open door the captain's
cot, and a guard standing motionless beside it.The captain had
elected to remain there for the night, while his men found a prickly
hospitality among the cowering townsfolk.Jose knew now that the hand
which Don Mario had dealt himself in the game inaugurated by Wenceslas
had been from a stacked deck.He knew that the President of the
Republic had ordered Morales to this inoffensive little town to quell
an alleged anticlerical uprising, and that the execution of the
misguided Alcalde had been determined long before the Hercules had got
under way.He could see that it was necessary for the Government to
sacrifice its agent in the person of the Alcalde, in order to prove
its own loyalty to the Church.And in return therefor he knew it would
expect, not without reason, the cooeperation of the Church in case the
President's interference in the province of Bolivar should precipitate
a general revolt.But what had been determined upon as his own fate?He had not the
semblance of an idea.From the confession of the ruined Alcalde he now
knew that Don Mario had been poisoned against him from the beginning;
that even the letters of introduction which Wenceslas had given him to
the Alcalde contained the charge of his having accomplished the ruin
of the girl Maria in Cartagena, and of his previous incarceration in
the monastery of Palazzola.And Don Mario had confessed in his last
moments that Wenceslas had sought to work through him and Jose in the
hope that the location of the famous mine, La Libertad, might be
revealed.Don Mario had been instructed to get what he could out of
this scion of Rincon; and only his own greed and cupidity had caused
him to play fast and loose with both sides until, falling before the
allurements which Wenceslas held out, he had rushed madly into his own
destruction.Jose realized that so far he himself had proved extremely
useful to Wenceslas--but had his usefulness ended?At these thoughts
his soul momentarily suffused with the pride of the old and hectoring
Rincon stock and rose, instinct with revolt--but only to sink again in
helpless resignation, while the shadow of despair rolled in and
quenched his feeble determination.Rosendo and Don Jorge placed the body in one of the vacant vaults and
filled the entrance with some loose bricks.He had a part to perform,
out there on the bleak hilltop in the ghostly light.But Jose remained
motionless and silent, his head sunk upon his breast.Then Rosendo, waxing troubled, spoke in gentle admonition."He would
expect it, you know, Padre."Bitter tears coursed down his
cheeks, and his voice broke.He laid his head on Rosendo's stalwart
shoulder and wept aloud.The sickly, greenish cast of the moonlight silhouetted the figures of
the three men in grotesque shapes against the cemetery wall and the
crumbling tombs.The morose call of a toucan floated weirdly upon the
heavy air.The faint wail of the frogs in the shallow waters below
rose like the despairing sighs of lost souls.Rosendo wound his long arm about the sorrowing priest.Don Jorge's
muscles knotted, and a muttered imprecation rose from his tight lips.Strangely had the shift and coil of the human mind thrown together
these three men, so different in character, yet standing now in united
protest against the misery which men heap upon their fellow-men in the
name of Christ.Jose, the apostate agent of Holy Church, his hands
bound, and his heart bursting with yearning toward his fellow-men;
Rosendo, simple-minded and faithful, chained to the Church by heredity
and association, yet ashamed of its abuses and lusts; Don Jorge,
fierce in his denunciation of the political and religious sham and
hypocrisy which he saw masking behind the cloak of imperial religion."I have nothing to say, friends," moaned Jose, raising his head;
"nothing that would not still further reveal my own miserable weakness
and the despicable falsity of the Church.If the Church had followed
the Christ, it would have taught me to do likewise; and I should now
call to Lazaro and bid him come forth, instead of shamefully
confessing my impotency and utter lack of spirituality, even while I
pose as an _Alter Christus_.""You--you will leave a blessing with him before we go, Padre?"queried
the anxious Rosendo, clinging still to the frayed edge of his fathers'
faith."My blessing, Rosendo," replied Jose sadly, "would do no good.He lies
there because we have utterly forgotten what the Master came to teach.He lies there because of our false, undemonstrable, mortal beliefs.Oh, that the Church, instead of wasting time murmuring futile prayers
over dead bodies, had striven to learn to do the deeds which the
Christ said we should all do if we but kept his commandments!""But, Padre, you will say Masses for him?"I would not take his or your money to
give to the Church to get his soul out of an imagined purgatory which
the Church long ago invented for the purpose of enriching herself
materially--for, alas!after spiritual riches she has had little
hankering.""To pay God to get His own children out of the flames, eh?""It is what I have always said, the religion of the Church
is a _religion de dinero_.If there ever was a God, either He is still
laughing Himself sick at our follies--or else He has wept Himself to
death over them!"Friend," said Jose solemnly, turning to Don Jorge, "I long since
learned what the whole world must learn some time, that the Church
stands to-day, not as the bride of the Christ, but as the incarnation
of the human mind, as error opposed to Truth.It is the embodiment of
'Who shall be greatest?'It is one of the various phenomena of the
human mentality; and its adherents are the victims of authoritative
falsehood.Its Mass and countless other ceremonies differ in no
essential respect from ancient pagan worship.And so it can do none of the works of the Master.Its corrupting
faith is foully materialistic.And as the human mind expands, the incoming light must drive out the
black beliefs and deeds of Holy Church, else the oncoming centuries
will have no place for it.""But why do you still remain a
priest?I knew when I saw you on the river boat that you
were none.But," his voice dropping to a whisper, "there is a soldier
in the road below.He might think we were
here to plot."When the soldier had passed, they quietly left the gloomy cemetery and
made their way quickly back through the straggling moonlight to
Rosendo's house.Dona Maria, with characteristic quietude, was
preparing for the duties of the approaching day.Jose went to her bedside and bent over her, wondering.What were the
events of the past few days in her sight?What did Lazaro's death and the
execution of Don Mario mean to her?Did she, as he had done, look upon
them as real events in a real world, created and governed by a good
God?Or did she still hold such things to be the unreal phenomena of
the human mentality?--unreal, because opposed to God, and without the
infinite principle.As for himself, how had the current of his life
been diverted by this rare child!What had she not sought to teach him
by her simple faith, her unshaken trust in the immanence of good!True, as a pure reflection of good she had seemed to be the means of
stirring up tremendous evil.But had he not seen the evil eventually
consume itself, leaving her unscathed?He himself had always conceded to the forces of evil as great power as
to those of good--nay, even greater.And even now as he stood looking
at her, wrapped in peaceful slumber, his strained sight caught no
gleam of hope, no light flashing through the heavy clouds of
misfortune that lowered above her.He turned away with an anxious
sigh."Padre," said the gentle Dona Maria, "the two _Americanos_--"

"Ah, yes," interrupted Jose, suddenly remembering that he had sent
word to them to use his house while they remained in the town."They brought their baggage to your house an hour ago and set up their
beds in your living room."Good," he replied, a wistful sense of gratitude stealing over him at
the reassuring thought of their presence."_Bien_, we will not disturb
them."Summoning Rosendo and Don Jorge, the three men sought the lake's edge.There, seated on the loose shales, they wrestled with their problem
until dawn spread her filmy veil over the shimmering stars.*       *       *       *       *

Long before sun-up the soldiers and the _peones_, whom Captain Morales
had impressed, were busy gathering the commandeered rifles and
carrying them down to the gunboat Hercules, waiting at the mouth of
the Boque river, some six or eight miles distant, and over a wild
trail.The townsfolk, thoroughly frightened, hugged the shelter of
their homes, and left the streets to the troops.Though they detested
the soldiers, yet none would lightly risk a blow from the heavy hand
of Morales, whose authority on a punitive expedition of this sort was
unlimited.The summary execution of the Alcalde had stricken them with
horror, and left an impression which never would be erased from their
memories.Immediately after the early _desayuno_ the captain appeared at
Rosendo's door.He had come to say farewell to the priest.All of the
soldiers had disappeared down the trail, with the exception of the two
who formed the captain's small personal escort."_Conque, adios, Senor Padre_" he called cheerily, as he approached.Jose was sitting at table with Rosendo's family and Don Jorge.Instinctively he rose hastily, and seizing Carmen, thrust her into the
adjoining bedroom and closed the door.Then he went out to face the
captain."Much excitement for your little _pueblo_, no?"exclaimed the captain
with a bluff laugh as he grasped Jose's hand."But a lesson like this
will last a century.I rejoice that I found it unnecessary to burn the
town.""_Senor Capitan_, I, too, rejoice.But--the state of the country--what may we expect?""_Caramba, Padre mio_!There
is much talk, many angry looks, much gesturing and waving of hands.The President sees fit to send me here, without
order from the Departmental Governor.He shrugged his shoulders with that expressive Latin
gesture which indicates complete irresponsibility for and indifference
to results."_Bueno pues, Senor Capitan_,"
he said hurriedly."I wish you every felicitation on your return trip.Ah--ah--your orders contained no reference to--to me?""None whatever, _Senor Padre_," replied the captain genially.He
turned to go, and Jose stifled a great sigh of relief.But suddenly
the captain stopped; then turned again.He fumbled in an inner pocket and drew forth a telegraphic document."_And you will seize the person of one Rosendo Ariza's daughter and
immediately send her with proper conveyance to the Sister Superior of
the convent of Our Lady in Cartagena_," he read aloud.From within Rosendo's house came a soft,
scurrying sound.Morales returned
the folded message to his pocket and started to enter the house.He was rendered suddenly inert, although
vividly conscious of a drama about to be enacted in which he and his
loved ones would play leading _roles_.As in a dream he heard the
captain address Rosendo and gruffly demand that he produce his
daughter.He heard a deep curse from Rosendo; and his blood congealed
more thickly as he dwelt momentarily on the old man's possible conduct
in the face of the federal demand.He heard Morales hunting
impatiently through the shabby rooms.Then he saw him emerge in a
towering rage--but empty-handed.cried the angry captain, "but what is this?Have
they not had one good lesson, that I must inflict another?I demand to
know, has this Rosendo Ariza a daughter?"He stood waiting for the answer that Jose knew he must make.The
priest's hollow voice sounded like an echo from another world."_Bien_, then I have discovered one honest man in yourself, Padre.You
will now assist me in finding her.""I--I know not--where--where she is, _Senor Capitan_," murmured Jose
with feebly fluttering lips.They were alone, this little party of actors, although many an eye
peered out timidly at them from behind closed shutters and barred
doors around the _plaza_.Don Jorge and Rosendo came out of the house
and stood behind Jose.The captain confronted them, bristling with
wrath at the insolence that dared oppose his supreme authority.The
heat had already begun to pour down in torrents.The morning air was
light, but not a sound traversed it.The principals in this tense
drama might have been painted against that vivid tropical background.Then Harris, moved by his piquant Yankee curiosity, appeared at the
door of the parish house, his great eyes protruding and his head
craned forth like a monster heron."Perhaps the _Americano_ hides the daughter of Ariza!"But ere he reached it Reed suddenly
appeared from behind Harris.In his hand he grasped a large American
flag.Holding this high above his head, he blocked the entrance."We are
American citizens, and this house is under the protection of the
American Government!"Morales fell back and stood with mouth agape in astonishment.The
audacity of this foreign adventurer fairly robbed him of his breath.He glanced dubiously from him to the priest.Then, to save the
situation, he broke into an embarrassed laugh."_Bien_, my good friend," he finally said, addressing Reed in his
courtliest manner, "all respect to your excellent Government.And, if
you will accept it, I shall be pleased to secure you a commission in
the Colombian army.But, my orders--you understand, do you not?The
sun is already high, and I can not lose more time.Therefore, you will
kindly stand aside and permit me to search that house."He motioned to
his men and moved forward.Still holding aloft the flag, Reed drew a long revolver.Harris
quickly produced one of equal size and wicked appearance.Morales
stopped abruptly and looked at them in hesitation.His chief delight
when not in the field was the perusal of a battered history of the
American Civil War; and his exclamations of admiration for the
hardihood of those who participated in it were always loud and
frequent.But he, too, had a reputation to sustain.The Americans
stood grimly silent before him.Harris's finger twitched nervously
along the trigger, and a smile played over his thin lips.Then, his face flaming with shame and chagrin, Morales turned to his
escort and commanded them to advance.A moment more, and--

A cry came from Rosendo's house.Ana, her face swollen with weeping,
clasping her sightless babe to her bosom, had emerged and faced the
captain."Senor," she said in a voice strained to a whisper, "I am the daughter
of Rosendo Ariza."A half-suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of Rosendo.A
desperate, suffocating joy surged over the riven soul of the priest.Don Jorge's mouth opened, but no sound came forth.This precipitate
_denouement_ held them rigid with astonishment.In the eyes of Jose Ana's
tense figure, standing grim and rigid before the captain, took on a
dignity that was majestic, a worth that transcended all human
computation.A Magdalen, yes, standing with her sin-conceived child
clasped in her trembling arms.this
sacrificial act broke the alabaster box and spread the precious nard
over the feet of the pitying Christ."It is," murmured the dazed priest, scarce hearing his own words."But--I have no orders respecting a child--"

"They cannot be separated," half whispered Jose, not daring to meet
the vacant gaze of the babe.Then, with an upward glance at
the sun, he gave a sharp command to his men.Placing the woman between
them, the two soldiers faced about and moved quickly away.With a low
bow and a final "_Adios, Senores_," the captain hurriedly joined them.Ere the little group before Rosendo's house had collected their wits,
the soldiers and their frail charge had mounted the hill beyond the
old church and disappeared into the matted trail that led from it to
the distant river.Rosendo was the first to break the mesmeric silence.His knees gave way beneath him and he buried his face in his
hands.Then he rose hastily, and made as if to pursue the soldiers.cried Don Jorge, "but it is the hand of Providence!Listen, friend Rosendo, it but gives us time to act!When the mistake is discovered they will return,
and they will bring her back unharmed--though they may not learn until
she reaches Cartagena!_Bien_, we can not waste time in mourning now!Rosendo strove to unravel his tangled wits.Jose went to him and
clasped his big hand."Rosendo--friend--would you have it different?I--I alone am to blame
that they took Anita!But--it was to save--to save--Ah, God!if I did
wrong, take the American's revolver and shoot me!"He tore open his
cassock and stood rigid before the dazed man.Anguish and soul-torture
had warped his features."We
shall find plenty of others more deserving of shooting, I think!Reed turned back into the parish house, and emerged a moment later
with Carmen and Dona Maria, who knew not as yet of Ana's departure."I
hid them in your bedroom, Padre," Reed explained."Dona Maria," he cried, "do you
take Carmen into your house and await our decision!And you, men, go
into my study!It is as Don Jorge says, we must act quickly!It may serve to protect us further
against the angry people of Simiti!"The five men quickly gathered in Jose's living room in a strained,
excited group.Rapidly he related
in detail Don Mario's last confession.When he had closed, Reed made
reply."Old man," he said, familiarly addressing Jose, "having seen the girl,
I do not at all wonder that blood has been shed over her.But to keep
her another hour in Simiti is to sacrifice her.If not, the people will drive you out.With the soldiers gone, the people will rise up against
you all.""But, friend, where shall we go?""There is
no place in Colombia now where she would be safe!""It can not be done," interposed Don Jorge."It would be impossible
for him to escape down the river with the girl, even if he had funds
to carry her away from Colombia, which he has not.To take the trail would only postpone for a short
time their certain capture.And then--well, we will not predict!To
flee into the jungle--or to hide among the _peones_ along the
trails--that might be done--yes.""What's the gibberish about now, pal?"put in Harris, whose knowledge
of the Spanish tongue was _nil_."Well, that's easy," returned Harris."Tell 'em you'll take the girl
out yourself.She's white enough to pass as your daughter, you know."Rosendo, stunned by the sudden departure of Ana, had sat in a state of
stupefaction during this conversation.But now he roused up and turned
to Reed.The latter translated his friend's suggestion, laughing as he
commented on its gross absurdity.Rosendo dropped his head again upon his chest and lapsed into silence.Then he rose unsteadily and passed a hand slowly across his brow.A
strange light had come into his eyes.For a moment he stood looking
fixedly at Reed."Senores," he said, rolling his syllables sonorously, "the time has
come at last!For years I have waited, waited, knowing that some day
the great gift which the good God put into my hands for the little
Carmen would be needed.The cruel
Spaniards drove them to and from their heavy labors with the lash; and
when the great war ended, they sank exhausted into their graves.My
parents--I have not told you this, Padre--were the slaves of Don
Ignacio de Rincon!"An exclamation burst from the astonished priest's lips.What, then,
had this man been concealing all these years?Little wonder that he
had hesitated when he learned that a Rincon had come to the parish of
Simiti!As he continued, his recital became
dramatic.As they listened, his auditors sat spellbound."Don Ignacio de Rincon himself was kind of heart.But his overseers--ah,
_Dios arriba_!Many a time the great lash wound
itself about my poor father's shrinking body, and hurled him shrieking to
the ground--and why?Because his blistered hands could not hold the
_batea_ with which he washed gold for your grandfather, Padre, your
grandfather!"A groan escaped him, and tears
trickled slowly down his sunken cheeks."I bear you no malice, Padre," continued Rosendo."It was hard those
first days to accept you here.But when, during your fever, I
learned from your own lips what you had suffered, I knew that you
needed a friend, and I took you to my bosom.And now I am glad--ah,
very glad, that I did so.But, though my confidence in you increased
day by day, I could never bring myself to tell you my great
secret--the secret that now I reveal for the sake of the little
Carmen.Padre--senores--I--_I am the owner of the great mine, La
Libertad_!"Had the heavens collapsed the astonishment of Don Jorge and the priest
could not have been greater.The coming of the soldiers, the terrific
strain of the past few days, culminating in the loss of Ana--all was
for the moment obliterated.Rosendo paused a moment for the effect which he knew his revelation
would produce, and then went on rapidly:

"Padre, the mine belonged to your grandfather.The gold taken from it was brought down the Guamoco trail to
Simiti, and from here shipped to Cartagena, where he lived in great
elegance.I make no doubt the gold which you and the little Carmen
discovered in the old church that day came from this same wonderful
mine.But the ore was quartz, and _arrastras_ were required to grind
it, and much skill was needed, too.He had men from old Spain, deeply
versed in such knowledge.Ah, the tales my poor father told of that
mine!"_Bien_, the war broke out.The Guamoco region became depopulated, and
sank back into the jungle.The location of the mine had been recorded
in Cartagena; but, as you know, when Don Ignacio fled from this
country he destroyed the record.He did the same with the records in
Simiti, on that last flying trip here, when he hid the gold in the
altar of the old church.And then the jungle grew up around the mine
during those thirteen long years of warfare--the people who knew of it
died off--and the mine was lost, utterly lost!"The little group sat enthralled before him.All
but Harris, who was vainly beseeching Reed to translate to him the
dramatic story."Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "from what my father had told me
I had a vague idea of the location of that mine.And many a weary day
I spent hunting for it!It was while I was on the Tigui, washing gold.I was
working near what we used to call _Pozo Cayman_, opposite La Colorado,
where the Frenchmen died.I camped on the lonely bank there, with only
the birds and the wondering animals to keep me company.One dark
night, as I lay on the ground, I had a dream.I dreamt that the Virgin, all in white, came to me where I
lay--that she whispered to me and told me to rise quickly and drive
away the devil.It was still dark, but a pair of fiery eyes were
gleaming at me from the bush.I seized my _machete_ and started after
them.It was a jaguar, Padre, and he fled up the hill from me.Why I
followed, I know not, unless I thought, still half asleep as I was,
that I was obeying the Virgin."At the top of the hill I lost the animal--and myself, as well.I am a
good woodsman, senores, and not easily lost.But this time my poor
head went badly astray.At last I
came to the edge of a steep ravine.I clambered down the sides into
the gully below.I thought it looked like an old trail, and I followed
it.So narrow was it at times that the walls almost touched.Then it widened, and I knew that at last I was in a trail,
long since abandoned--and how old, only the good God himself knew!"But my story grows as long as the trail!On and on I went, crossing
stream after stream, scaring snakes from my path, frightening the
birds above, who doubtless have never seen men in that region, all the
time thinking I was going toward the Tigui, until at last the old
sunken trail led me up a tremendous hill.At the top, buried in a
dense matting of brush, I fell over a circle of stones.They were the
remains of an ancient _arrastra_.Further on I found another; and
still another.Then, near them, the stone foundations of houses, long
since gone to decay.From these the trail took me into a gully, where
but little water flowed.I struck
off a piece from one of the largest.I went on up the stream, striking
off piece after piece from the great rocks.Every one showed specks of
free gold.Tunnel after tunnel yawned at me from the hillside.Some of
these were still open, where they had been driven through the hard
rock.I had my wallet, in which I always carry
matches and a bit of candle.far within I crossed a quartz vein--I scraped it with my
_machete_.it could not have been less than six feet in
width--and all speckled with gold!Above it, far into the blackness,
where bats were scurrying madly, the ore had been taken out long, long
ago.In the darkness below I stumbled over old, rusted tools.Every
one bore the inscription, 'I de R.'Your grandfather, Padre, put his
stamp on everything belonging to him.Then, as I sat trying to place
myself, my father's oft-told story of the location of the mine flashed
into my brain.I was at the headwaters of the Borrachera._And I had discovered La
Libertad_!"Reed's eager ears had drunk in every word of the old man's dramatic
story.When Rosendo
paused again, he quickly asked:

"The title, senor?"Rosendo drew forth a paper from his bosom."You will recall, Padre," he said, addressing the dully wondering
Jose, "that I once asked you to give me a name for a mine--a rare
name?And you told me to call it the--the--what is it?""Yes," exclaimed the old man excitedly, "that is it!_Bien_, I told no
one of my discovery of years before.I had never had money enough to
get the title to it.But when it seemed that I
might soon have use for it I sold my _finca_ for funds and had Lazaro
apply through Don Mario for title to a mine called--called--"

"The Chicago mine," said Jose, again coming to the rescue._Bien_, Lazaro got the title, which I never could have done,
for at that time Don Mario would not have put through any papers for
me.I then had the unsuspecting Lazaro transfer the title to me,
and--_Bien_, I am the sole owner of La Libertad!"Reed examined the paper at some length, and then handed it back to
Rosendo."Can we not talk business, senor?""I am so situated that I can float an American company
to operate this mine, and allow you a large percentage of the returns.he exclaimed, unable longer to contain himself, "it is
your fortune!""Senor," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head, "I want no share in
any of your American companies.But--your friend--he has suggested
just what has been running through my mind ever since you came to
Simiti."The wild, terrifying idea tore through
his fraught brain.He turned quickly to Reed and addressed him in
English."Such a thing is
quite out of the question!"Priest, Reed's wife is
in Cartagena, waiting for him.Came down from New York that far for
the trip.What's to prevent her from taking
the girl to the States and placing her in a boarding school there
until such time as you can either follow, or this stew down here has
settled sufficiently to permit of her returning to you?"Reed threw up a deprecatory hand."But," interposed Harris exasperatedly, "would you leave the ravishing
little beauty here to fall into the hands of the cannibals who are
trailing her?if it weren't for the looks of the thing I'd
take her myself.But you've got a wife, so it'd be easy."He leaned
over to Reed and concluded in a whisper, "The old man's going to make
a proposition--listen!""But," remonstrated the latter, "the expense of keeping her in New
York indefinitely!For, unless I mistake much, none of these people
will ever see the States after she leaves.And then I have an adopted
daughter on my hands!now that my ambitious wife is
determined to break into New York society with her adorable sister, I
have no money to waste on adopted children!"Rosendo, who had been studying the Americans attentively during their
conversation, now laid a hand on Reed's."Senor," he said in a quiet
tone, "if you will take the little Carmen with you, and keep her safe
from harm until Padre Jose can come to you, or she can be returned to
us here, I will transfer to you a half interest in this mine."he cried wildly, "do not do that!_Dios arriba_, no!Ah, senor," turning to Reed, "I beg you will
forgive--but Rosendo is mad to suggest such a thing!We cannot permit
it--we--I--oh, God above!"He sank again into his chair and covered
his face with his hands.Don Jorge gave vent to a long, low whistle.Rosendo, his voice husky
and his lips trembling, went on:

"I know, Padre--I know.I will give the mine to
the American--and to Carmen.He has a powerful government back of him,
and he is able to defend the title and save her interest as well as
his own.As for me, I--_Bien_, I shall want nothing when Carmen
goes--nothing.""If you
don't tell me what all this is about now I shall shoot--and not
straight up, either!""Senores," said Reed in a controlled voice, "let me talk this matter
over with my friend here.Rosendo and Don Jorge bowed and silently withdrew from the parish
house.The former went at once to apprise the wondering Dona Maria of
the events which had crowded the morning's early hours and to answer
her apprehensive questionings regarding Ana.Carmen was to know only
that Ana--but what could he tell her?That the woman had sacrificed
herself for the girl?No; but that they had seized this opportunity to
send her, under the protection of Captain Morales, to the Sisters of
the Convent of Our Lady.The old man knew that the girl would see only
God's hand in the event.It seemed to him that once his arms
closed about her no power under the skies could tear them asunder.He
found her sitting in the doorway at the rear of Rosendo's house,
looking dreamily out over the placid lake.Cucumbra, now old and
feeble, slept at her feet.As the man approached he heard her murmur
repeatedly, "It is not true--it is not true--it is not true!""Gladly, Padre--but where?""God only knows--to the end of the world!""Well, Padre dear," she softly replied, as she smiled up into his
drawn face, "we will start out.But I think we had better rest when we
reach the shales, don't you?"CHAPTER 35


"No, Padre dear," with an energetic shake of her head, "no.Not even
after all that has seemed to happen to us do I believe it true.No, I
do not believe it real.It does not exist,
excepting in the human mind.And that, as you yourself know, can not
be real, for it is all that God is not."They were seated beneath the slowly withering _algarroba_ tree out on
the burning shales.Jose still held the girl's hand tightly in his.Again he was struggling with self, struggling to pass the borderline
from, self-consciousness to God-consciousness; striving, under the
spiritual influence of this girl, to break the mesmeric hold of his
own mortal beliefs, and swing freely out into his true orbit about the
central Sun, infinite Mind.The young girl, burgeoning into a marvelous womanhood, sat before him
like an embodied spirit.Her beauty of soul shone out in gorgeous
luxuriance, and seemed to him to envelop her in a sheen of radiance.The brilliant sunshine glanced sparkling from her glossy hair into a
nimbus of light about her head.Her rich complexion was but faintly
suggestive to him of a Latin origin.Her oval face and regular
features might have indicated any of the ruddier branches of the
so-called Aryan stock.But his thought was not dwelling on these
things now.It was brooding over the events of the past few weeks, and
their probable consequences."Padre dear," she had said, when his tremulous voice ceased, "how
much longer will you believe that two and two are seven?And how much
longer will you try to make me believe it?Oh, Padre, at first you did
seem to see so clearly, and you talked so beautifully to me!And then,
when things seemed to go wrong, you went right back to your old
thoughts and opened the door and let them all in again.And so things
couldn't help getting worse for you.You told me yourself, long ago,
that you would have to empty your mind of its old beliefs.But I guess
you didn't get them all out.If you had cleaned house and got your
mind ready for the good thoughts, they would have come in.You know,
you have to get ready for the good, before it can come.But you go right on getting ready for evil.If you loved
God--really _loved_ Him--why, you would not be worried and anxious
to-day, and you would not be believing still that two and two are
seven.You told me, oh, so long ago!that this human life was just a
_sense_ of life, a series of states of consciousness, and that
consciousness was only mental activity, the activity of thought.Well,
I remembered that, and put it into practice--but you didn't.A true
consciousness is the activity of true thought, you said.A false
consciousness is the activity of false thought.True thought comes
from God, who is mind.False thought is the opposite of true thought,
and doesn't come from any mind at all, but is just supposition.A
supposition is never really created, because it is never real--never
truth.True thought becomes externalized to us in good, in harmony, in
happiness.False thought becomes externalized to us in unhappiness,
sickness, loss, in wrong-doing, and in death.It is unreal, and yet
awfully real to those who believe it to be real.Why don't you act
your knowledge, as you at first said you were going to do?I have all
along tried to do this.Whenever thoughts come to me I always look
carefully at them to see whether they are based on any real principle,
on God.Sometimes it
has been hard to tell just which were true and which false.And
sometimes I got caught, and had to pay the penalty.But every day I do
better; and the time will come at last when I shall be able to tell at
once which thoughts are true and which untrue.When that time comes,
nothing but good thoughts will enter, and nothing but good will be
externalized to me in consciousness.I shall be in heaven--all the
heaven there is.It is the heaven which Jesus talked so much about,
and which he said was within us all.It is so simple, Padre dear, so
simple!"The man sat humbly before her like a rebuked child.Indeed, these were the very things that he had taught her
himself.Why, then, had he failed to demonstrate them?Only because
he had attempted to mix error with truth--had clung to the reality and
immanence of evil, even while striving to believe good omnipotent and
infinite.He had worked out these theories, and they had appeared
beautiful to him.But, while Carmen had eagerly grasped and
assimilated them, even to the consistent shaping of her daily life to
accord with them, he had gone on putting the stamp of genuineness and
reality upon every sort of thought and upon every human event as it
had been enacted in his conscious experience.His difficulty was that,
having proclaimed the allness of spirit, God, he had proceeded to bow
the knee to evil.Carmen had seemed to know that the mortal, material
concepts of humanity would dissolve in the light of truth.He, on the
other hand, had clung to them, even though they seared the mind that
held them, and became externalized in utter wretchedness."When you let God's thoughts in, Padre, and drive out their
opposites, then sickness and unhappiness will disappear, just as
the mist disappears over the lake when the sun rises and the light
goes through it.If you really expected to some day see the now
'unseen things' of God, you would get ready for them, and you would
'rejoice always,' even though you did seem to see the wickedness of
Padre Diego, the coming of the soldiers, the death of Lazaro and Don
Mario, and lots of unhappiness about yourself and me.Those men are
not dead--except to your thought.You ought to know that all these
things are the unreal thoughts externalized in your consciousness.And, knowing them for what they really are, the opposites of God's
thoughts, you ought to know that they can have no more power over
you than anything else that you know to be supposition.We can
suppose that two and two are seven, but we can't make it true.The
supposition does not have any effect upon us.But as regards just thought--and you yourself said that everything
reduces to thought--why, people seem to think it is different.Don't you understand what the good man Jesus meant when he
told the Pharisees to first cleanse the cup and platter within,
that the outside might also be clean?Why, that was a clear case of
externalization, if there ever was one!Cleanse your thought, and
everything outside of you will then become clean, for your clean
thought will become externalized.You once said that you believed
in the theory that 'like attracts like.'I believe that
good thoughts attract good ones, and evil thoughts attract thoughts
like themselves.And you ought to know that your
life shows it, too.You hold fear-thoughts and worry-thoughts, and
then, just as soon as these become externalized to you as misfortune
and unhappiness, you say that evil is real and powerful, and that
God permits it to exist.Yes, God does permit all the existence
there is to a supposition--which is none.You pity yourself and all
the world for being unhappy, when all you need is to do as Jesus told
you, and know God to be infinite Mind, and evil to be only the
suppositional opposite, without reality, without life, without
power--unless you give it these things in your own consciousness.You
don't have to take thought for your life.You don't have to be
covetous, or envious, or fearful, or anxious.You couldn't do
anything if you were.Jesus said that
of himself he could do nothing.But--as soon as he recognized God as
the infinite principle of all, and acted that knowledge--why, then
he raised the dead!And at last, when his understanding was greater,
he dissolved the mental concept which people called his human body.Don't you see it, Padre--don't you?And yet:

"But, Carmen, padre Rosendo would send you out of the country with
these Americans!"And you have said that you have always feared
you would lose me.I have not
feared that I would lose you.But, Padre dear--"

The ghastly look on the man's face threw wide the flood-gates of her
sympathy."Padre--all things work together for good, you know.Listen--" She clung more closely to
him."Padre, it may be best, after all.You do not want me to stay always
in Simiti.And if I go, you will go with me, or soon follow.Oh, Padre
dear, you have told me that up in that great country above us the
people do not know God as you and I are learning to know Him.Padre--I
want to go and tell them about Him!I've wanted to for a long, long
time."The girl's eyes shone with a holy light.Her wistful face glowed with
a love divine."Padre dear, you have so often said that I had a message for the
world.Do not the people up north need that message?The people of Simiti are too dull to hear the message
now.But up there--Oh, Padre, it may be right that I should go!And, if it is right, nothing can prevent it, for the right _will_ be
externalized!Such a spirit as hers could not
long be confined within the narrow verges of Simiti.He must not
oppose his egoism to her interests.And, besides, he might follow
soon.it might be the opening of the
way to the consummation of that heart-longing for--

Ah, the desperate joy that surged through his yearning soul at the
thought!A year, two, three, and he would still
be a young man!She loved him--never had man had such proofs as he of
an affection so divine!"Carmen," he said tenderly, drawing her closer to him, "you may be
right.Yes--we will both go with the Americans.Once out of this
environment and free from ecclesiastical chains, I shall do better."The girl looked up at him with brimming eyes."Padre dear," she
whispered, "I want to go--away from Simiti.Juan--he asks me almost
every day to marry him.Even in
the church, when Don Mario was trying to get us, Juan said he would
save me if I would promise to marry him.He said he would go to
Cartagena and kill the Bishop.He--Padre,
he is a good boy.But--I do not--want to marry him."Jose knew how insistent Juan had
become."Padre, you--you are not always going to be a priest--are you?And--I--I--oh, Padre dear, I love you so!"She turned impulsively and
threw both arms about his neck."I want to see you work out your
problem.You can go with me--and I can always live
with you--and some day--some day--" She buried her face in his
shoulder.The artless girl had never seemed to think it unmaidenly to
declare her love for him, to show him unmistakably that she hoped to
become his wife.The beautiful child in his arms
was human!Young in years, and yet a woman by the conventions of these
tropic lands.Why, she had long
insisted that she would wait for him!And why should he now oppose the
externalization of that sweet thought?"Ah, _chiquita_," he murmured, "I will indeed go with you now!I will
send my resignation to the Bishop at once.No, I will wait and send it
from the States.I will renounce my oath, abjure my promise--"

The girl sat suddenly upright and looked earnestly into his eyes.But--I promised my mother, dearest one,
that I would always remain a priest--unless, indeed, the Church
herself should eject me from the priesthood.But, it was foolish--"

"And your mother--she expects you to keep your word?"The girl sat in pensive silence for a moment."But, Padre," she
resumed, "honesty--it is the very first thing that God requires of us.We have to be--we _must_ be honest, for He is Truth.He cannot see or
recognize error, you know.And so He cannot see you and help you if
you are dishonest."And I tried to be honest, even when circumstances and
my own poor resistive force combined to direct me into the priesthood.But--since that day I have lived a life of hypocrisy, not knowing how
to shape my course."But, Padre, the Church has not put you out?"But, if you went to the States--with me--would you be put out of the
Church?""Possibly, _chiquita_.""And what would that mean, Padre?""The disgrace that always attaches to an apostate priest, child.""And, Padre--your mother--what would she say?""It would kill her," he replied slowly.Carmen reflected long, while Jose, with ebbing hope, waited."Padre
dear," she finally said, "then you have not yet worked out your
problem--have you?"And he was now attempting to solve it by flight."I mean, Padre, you have not worked it out in God's way.For if you
had, no one would be hurt, and there could not be any disgrace, or
unhappiness--could there?""But, _chiquita_," he cried in despair, "nothing but excommunication
can release me!And I long ago ceased to look for that.You do not
understand--you are young!"Why, Padre dear, you can work it out, all out, in God's way.""But--must I remain here--can I let you go alone with the Americans--?""Yes, you can, if it is right," she answered gently.he cried, straining her in his arms."If you go with the
Americans, I shall, I must, go too!""Not unless it is right, Padre," she insisted."If it is right,
nothing can keep you from going.But, unless it is God's way--well,
you can not solve your problem by running away from it.""But--child--to remain here means--God above!you don't realize what
it may mean to us both!"Jose began to feel that they were
drifting hopelessly, abysmally apart."I have been cheated and thwarted all my
wretched life!I can not, would not, hold
you here, if the way opens for you to go!But--I can not remain here
without you--and live!""That is not true, Padre," replied the girl, slowly shaking her head."No human being is necessary to any one's happiness.You are trying to 'acquire that mind which was in
Christ.'If you are really progressing, why, you will surely be happy.But you must work it all out God's way.""And that--"

"You must be honest, Padre, honest with Him and with everybody.If you
can no longer be a priest--if you are not one, and never have been
one--you must be honest with the Church and with yourself.Why do you not write to the Bishop and
tell him all about it?You must--Padre, you _must_--be honest!Write to your
mother--write to the Bishop.But--oh,
Padre dear, you must trust Him, and you must--you _must_--know that He
is good, that He is infinite, and that there is no evil!Otherwise,
the good can not be externalized.If you did that, your problem would
be quickly solved.""Padre dear," she continued, "God is
life--there is no death.God is all
good--there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.God is infinite, and He
is mind--there is no inability to see the right and to do it.God is
my mind, my spirit, my soul, my all.I look at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him.But He is just as much to you as He is to me.You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only work out in
the right way.Only by so doing can
you solve your problem.And I have
always worked for you that way.I have always thought the time would
come when you and I would live and work together--always.I have not said that it _had_ to be.If it works
out that way, I know I would be very happy.But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the good God
is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me all happiness.And
now we must leave everything to Him, while we work, work, work to see
Him only everywhere."Suffering himself to be led by her, they
crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made their way silently
through the burning heat into the village.At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo.His face was grave, but
his manner calm."Padre," he announced, "it is arranged."Jose's knees shook under him as he followed the old man into the
house.Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the table, on which were
strewn papers covered with figures and sketches.The priest sat down
dumbly and drew Carmen to him.Harris fell to devouring the girl with
his bulging eyes.Reed at once plunged into the topic under
consideration."I have been saying," he began, addressing the priest, "that I can
accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with some amendments.Harris and I are under contract with the Molino Company to report upon
their properties along the Boque river.I am informed by Don Rosendo
that he is acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless.Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.But I will
agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection of my wife,
upon the consideration that when I reach my home city I be allowed to
form a company to take over this mine, returning to the girl a
fifty-one per cent interest in the stock, one half of which she agrees
in writing to deliver to me immediately upon its issuance.Being under
contract, I can not accept it now.The balance of the stock must be
sold for development purposes.I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or effect
her return to Colombia.Now, according to Ariza's sketches, we may
proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters--how far did you say,
friend?""Some hundred and fifty miles from Simiti, senor," replied Rosendo."And then," resumed Reed, "we can cut across country from the sources
of the Boque, following what is known as Rosario creek, down to the
river Tigui, striking the latter somewhere near the ancient point
known as La Colorado.""But, senor," interposed Rosendo, "remember that the headwaters of the
Boque are practically unknown to-day.Many years ago, when I was a
small lad, some liberated slaves worked along Rosario creek, which was
then one day's journey on foot with packs from La Colorado.But that
old trail has long since disappeared.Probably no one has been over it
since.""Very well," returned the practical Reed, "then we shall have to make
our own trail across the divide to the Tigui.But once at La Colorado,
you tell me there is an ancient trail that leads down to Llano, on the
Nechi river?""Yes, to the mouth of the Amaceri.Llano was something of a town long
ago.But river steamers that go up the Nechi as far as Zaragoza once a
month, or less frequently, still touch there, I am told.And so you
can get down the Cauca to Maganguey, where you can change to a
Magdalena river boat for Calamar.The trail
to Llano can not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly
open."Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled softly.he muttered, "nearly two hundred miles, and all by foot, over
unspeakable jungle trails!""Very well, then," he continued, "we
had best set out as soon as possible.To you, friend Rosendo, I leave
all arrangements regarding supplies and _cargadores_.I will furnish
funds for the entire expedition, expecting to be reimbursed by La
Libertad."Carmen listened, with dilated eyes.Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately to inaugurate
preparations, he drew him into the latter's house.he
cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation, "do you know what you
are doing?Do you--"

"_Na_, Padre," replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, "it is best.I want the _Americanos_ to take Carmen.At any moment an order might come for your arrest or
mine.The struggle has been long, and I weary of it."He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow.If I can but know that she is safe--_Bien_, that is all.From what we
have learned, this country will soon be plunged again into war.I do
not wish to live through another revolution.I seem
to have fought all my life.I doubt
if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the title to
such a famous mine.But the _Americano_ can hold it.He will save Carmen's interest, and deal fairly with her._Bien_, let him place her in a school in the States.If you weather
the oncoming revolution, then you may be able to send for her."Rosendo," he said, "I will go with her.""Do you mean, Padre, that you
will leave the Church?""Can I remain longer in Simiti, where the people have become
divided--where they look upon me askance, as the cause of the trouble
that has befallen them?What, think you, will it mean to Simiti?And Wenceslas,
what has he further in store for you and me?What he has for Carmen,
we well know.But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained.The trick which Anita played upon
Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased wrath upon our heads,
especially yours and mine.No, Rosendo, you and I must go, and go at
once!""We will pick her up in Cartagena.I have certain information to give him that will enlist his
services--information which, I think, will serve to introduce him
to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly.But, come, Rosendo, do you and
Dona Maria prepare for flight!"I will go with
the _Americanos_ up the Boque and to La Libertad.Then I will return
to Simiti--or to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas, if Maria wishes to
remain there while I am in the hills.But--do you go, Padre--go and
look after the girl.Yes,
Padre, go--go!""But--ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider?The Americans will take us all
for that mine!"No, Padre," said the old man firmly, but in a voice heavy with
sadness.My work is done when I have
seen the girl safely out of this unhappy country.Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo's arms.she cried, aglow with animation, "we are all going to the States up
north!Oh, padre, isn't it beautiful!""Ah, _chiquita_," said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to him, "I
guess we have decided to send you on ahead--a little ahead of us.Your
old padre has some business he must attend to here before he leaves."Jose knew what his effort at cheerfulness was
costing him."But, padre Rosendo, you will come--later?She
looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully."Yes, little one, yes--of course.For where you are, there your old
padre will always be--always--always!"panted the girl under Rosendo's tight grasp as she
turned her head toward the priest."He goes with us," assured Rosendo--"I think--at least as far as the
coast.He will see Anita--and--" His voice broke, and he turned
abruptly away."And she will go to the States with us!cried the girl,
bounding up and down with joy.Jose turned and went quickly into his own house.With grim determination
he drew the battered haircloth trunk from beneath his bed and began
to throw his few effects into it.But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud title of
official courier between Simiti and Bodega Central, entered with a
letter.Jose recognized the writing, and tore it open at once."My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager income,
together with what little you have been able to send me from time to
time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle, to
enable me to visit you.I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey.And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that
your long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle
informs me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by
poignant suffering.Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my
beloved son."The letter slipped from the priest's fingers and drifted to the floor.With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.CHAPTER 36


What had kept Jose de Rincon chained all these years to an institution
to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy he was so utterly alien, we
have repeatedly pointed out--a warped sense of filial devotion, a
devotion that would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud,
sensitive mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just
that which it strives to avoid.But yet he had somehow failed to note
the nice distinction which he was always making between the promises
he had given to her and the oath which he had taken at his ordination.He had permitted himself to be held to the Church by his mother's fond
desires, despite the fact that his nominal observance of these had
wrecked his own life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave.The abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of the
sapient words of Jesus: "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."And he had sacrificed his new-found life to the
child.He had exhausted every expedient to keep himself in Simiti,
that he might transfer his own great learning to this girl, and at the
same time yield himself to her beneficent influence.Yet, despite his
vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Daniel travelled to the garden.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.He was only a nuisance
to himself and his family.West was shocked by this sudden and
mysterious disappearance.He was her husband, and the father of her
children, and it was not strange that she wept, and even hoped that he
would come back.The neighbors comforted her, and put her in the way
of supporting herself and the children, so that she was very soon
reconciled to the event.When West had been gone a month, his wife received a letter from him,
informing her that he had determined to stop drinking, and be a man
again.He could not keep sober in Redfield, among his old companions,
and he was at work in Providence till he could get money enough to
pay his expenses to Valparaiso, in South America, where a lucrative
place awaited him.He hoped his wife would manage to get along for a
few months, when he should be able to send her some money.Her husband was not dead, was not drowned in
the river, or lost in the woods; and her heart was cheered by the
prospects of future plenty, which the letter pointed out to her.A year passed by, and nothing more was heard from Franklin West.The
poor, forsaken wife had a hard time to support her little family.The
most constant and severe toil enabled her to pinch her way along; but
it was a bitter trial.She had no relations to help her; and though
the neighbors were as kind as neighbors could be, life was a hard
struggle.This bereavement seemed to unnerve
and discourage her, and though there was one mouth less to feed, her
strength failed her, and she was unequal to the task.Care and sorrow
did their work upon her, and though people said she died of
consumption, Heaven knew she died of a broken heart and disappointed
hopes.Harry was four years old when this sad event left him alone in the
world.There was none willing to assume the burden of bringing up the
lonely little pilgrim, and he was sent to the poorhouse.It was a hard
fate for the tender child to be removed from the endearments of a
mother's love, and placed in the cheerless asylum which public charity
provides for the poor and the friendless.The child was only four years old; but he missed the fond kiss and the
loving caresses of his devoted mother.They were kind to him there,
but it was not home, and his heart could not but yearn for those
treasures of affection which glittered for him only in the heart of
his mother.There was an aching void, and though he could not
understand or appreciate his loss, it was none the less painful.He was a favorite child, not only with the old paupers, but with the
keeper and his family; and this circumstance undoubtedly softened the
asperities of his lot.As soon as he was old enough, he was required
to work as much as the keeper thought his strength would bear.He was
very handy about the house and barn, more so than boys usually are;
and Mr.Nason declared that, for the three years before it was
proposed to send him away, he had more than earned his board and
clothes.He had been at school four winters, and the schoolmasters were
unanimous in their praise.He was a smart scholar, but a little
disposed to be roguish.The moral discipline of the poorhouse was not of the most salutary
character.Nason, though a generous and kind-hearted man, was not
as exemplary in his daily life as might have been desired.Besides,
one or two of the old paupers were rather corrupt in their manners and
morals, and were not fit companions for a young immortal, whose mind,
like plastic clay, was impressible to the forming power.The poorhouse was not a good place for the boy, and the wonder is that
Harry, at twelve years of age, was not worse than we find him.Nason, as he had learned to fear and to hate
Squire Walker.The latter seemed to have absolute power at the
poorhouse, and to be lord and master in Redfield.But when the
overseer proposed to place the boy in the family of a man whom even
the paupers looked down upon and despised, his soul rebelled even
against the mandate of the powerful magnate of the town.Harry turned the matter over and over in his mind as he sat upon the
rock at Pine Pleasant.At first he tried to reconcile the idea of
living with Jacob Wire; but it was a fruitless effort.The poorhouse
seemed like a paradise to such a fate.Then he considered the possibility and the practicability of resisting
the commands of Squire Walker.He could not obtain much satisfaction
from either view of the difficult problem, and as a happy resort under
the trials of the moment, he began to console himself with the
reflection that Mr.Nason might prevail with the overseers, and save
him from his doom.He had not much hope from this direction, and while he was turning
again to the question of resistance, he heard footsteps in the grove.He did not feel like seeing any person and wished he could get out of
sight; but there was no retreating without being observed, so he lay
down upon the rock to wait till the intruder had passed.The person approaching did not purpose to let him off so easily; and
when Harry heard his step on the log he raised himself up.It was Ben Smart, a boy of fourteen, who lived near the poorhouse.Ben's reputation in Redfield was not A, No.1; in fact, he had been
solemnly and publicly expelled from the district school only three
days before by Squire Walker, because the mistress could not manage
him.His father was the village blacksmith, and as he had nothing for
him to do--not particularly for the boy's benefit--he kept him at
school all the year round.replied Harry, more for the sake of being civil
than because he wished to speak to the other.asked Ben, who evidently did not understand
how a boy could be there alone, unless he was occupied about
something.He suspected that Harry had been engaged in some
mysterious occupation, which he desired to conceal from him.It was worse than
the double rule of three, which he conscientiously believed had been
invented on purpose to bother school boys."You are up to some trick, I know.Tell me what you come down here
for."No feller would come clear down here
for nothing.""I came down to think, then, if you must know," answered Harry, rather
testily.Ain't the poor-farm big enough to
do your thinking on?"I should think old Walker had
been afoul of you, by your looks."Harry looked up suddenly, and wondered if Ben knew what had happened."I should like to have the old rascal down here for half an hour.I
should like to souse him into the river, and hold his head under till
he begged my pardon," continued Ben.I mean to pay him off for
what he did for me the other day.I wouldn't minded being turned out
of school.I rather liked the idea; but the old muttonhead got me up
before all the school, and read me such a lecture!He thinks there
isn't anybody in the world but him.""The lecture didn't hurt you," suggested Harry."My father give me a confounded licking when I got home.But I will pay 'em for it all.""If I only had a father, I wouldn't mind letting him lick me now and
then," replied Harry, to whom home seemed a paradise, though he had
never understood it; and a father and mother, though coarse and
brutal, his imagination pictured as angels."My father would learn you better than that in a few days," said Ben,
who did not appreciate his parents, especially when they held the rod.He thought how happy he should have
been in Ben's place.We value most what we
have not; and if the pauper boy could have had the blessings which
crowned his reckless companion's lot, it seemed as though he would
have been contented and happy.His condescension in regard to the
flogging now and then was a sincere expression of feeling."What's old Walker been doing to you, Harry?"asked Ben, suspecting
the cause of the other's gloom."He is going to send me to Jacob Wire's to live."To die, you mean; Harry, I wouldn't stand
that.""That's right; I like your spunk.He possessed a certain
degree of prudence, and though it was easy to declare war against so
powerful an enemy as Squire Walker, it was not so easy to carry on the
war after it was declared.The overseer was a bigger man to him than
the ogre in "Puss in Boots."Probably his imagination largely
magnified the grandeur of the squire's position, and indefinitely
multiplied the resources at his command.repeated Ben, who for some reason or other
took a deep interest in Harry's affairs.I would rather die than go; but I don't know how I can
help myself," answered the poor boy, gloomily.Ben sympathized with him
in his trials, and his heart warmed towards him."I daresn't tell you now," replied Ben after a short pause.You are a first rate feller, and I like
you.But you see, if you should blow on me now, you would spoil my
kettle of fish, and your own, too.""Well, then, I will get you out of the scrape as nice as a cotton
hat.""I guess I won't tell you now; but if you will come down here to-night
at eleven o'clock I will let you into the whole thing."We all go to bed at eight
o'clock.""I can do that; but perhaps Mr.Nason will persuade the overseers not
to send me to Jacob Wire's.""I'm glad I didn't tell you, then.But promise me this, Harry: that,
whatever happens, you'll hold your tongue.""And if Nason don't get you off, be here at eleven o'clock.Put on
your best clothes, and take everything you want with you."Ben made him promise again to be secret, and they separated.Harry had
an idea of what his companion intended, and the scheme solved all his
doubts.It was a practicable scheme of resistance, and he returned to
the poorhouse, no longer fearful of the impending calamity.CHAPTER III

IN WHICH HARRY LEAVES THE POORHOUSE, AND TAKES TO THE RIVER


When Harry reached the poorhouse, Mr.Nason was absent, and one of the
paupers told him that he had taken the horse and wagon.He conjectured
that the keeper had gone to see the other overseers, to intercede with
them in his behalf.He did not feel as much interest in the mission as
he had felt two hours before, for Ben Stuart had provided a remedy for
his grievances, which he had fully decided to adopt.Nason returned; and when he came his
looks did not seem to indicate a favorable issue.Harry helped him
unharness the horse, and as he led him into the barn the keeper opened
the subject."I have been to see the other overseers, Harry," he began, in tones
which seemed to promise nothing hopeful."As I supposed, they are all afraid of Squire Walker.They daresn't
say their souls are their own.""Then I must go to Jacob Wire's.""The other overseers declare, if the squire says so, you must."Nason," replied Harry, not much disappointed
at the result.Perhaps you might try the place, and then, if
you found you couldn't stand it we might make another trial to get you
off.""I don't want to go there, anyhow.I should like to help duck the
squire in the horse pond.""Well, Harry, I have done all I can for you," continued Mr.Nason,
seating himself on a keg on the barn floor."You have been very good to me, Mr.I shall always remember you
as the best friend I ever had," replied Harry, the tears streaming
down his sun-browned cheeks."Never mind that, Harry; don't cry.""I can't help it; you have been so good to me, that I hate to leave
you," blubbered Harry."I am sorry you must leave us; we shall miss you about the place, and
I wish it was so that you could stay.But what makes it ten times
worse is the idea of your going to Jacob Wire's."Nason," said Harry, dashing down his tears, and looking earnestly
at the keeper, "I have made up my mind that I won't go to Wire's
anyhow.""I don't blame you; but I don't see how you can fight the squire.He
carries too many guns for you, or for me, either, for that matter.I
have been thinking of something, Harry, though I suppose, if I should
speak it out loud, it would be as much as my place here is worth.""I have been thinking of something, too," continued Harry, with a good
deal of emphasis.Nason, sympathizing deeply with his young friend, did not attempt
to obtain any knowledge whose possession might be inconvenient to him.He was disposed to help the boy escape the fate in store for him; but
at the same time, having a family to support, he did not wish to lose
his situation, though, if the emergency had demanded it, he would
probably have been willing to make even this sacrifice."I was thinking, Harry, how astonished the squire would be, when he
comes over in the morning to take you to Jacob Wire's, if he should
not happen to find you here.""I dare say he would," answered Harry, with a meaning smile."By the way, have you heard from Charles Smith lately?You know he
went to Boston last spring, and they say he has got a place, and is
doing first rate there."The keeper smiled as he spoke, and Harry understood him as well as
though he had spoken out the real thought that was in his mind."I suppose others might do as he has done."Nason took from his pocket the large shot bag purse, in which he
kept his change, and picked out four quarters."Here, Harry, take these; when you get over to Wire's, money will keep
you from starving.exclaimed Harry, as he took the four quarters."You have been a father to me, and one of these days I shall be able
to pay you this money back again."Keep it; and I wish I had a
hundred times as much to give you."I shall be a man one of these
days, and we shall meet again."Harry felt the spirit of a
man stirring within him.He felt that the world had cast him off, and
refused him a home, even in the poorhouse.He was determined to push
his way through life like a hero, and he nerved himself to meet
whatever hardships and trials might be apportioned to him.After supper he went to his room, gathered up the few articles of
clothing which constituted his wardrobe, and tying them up in a
bundle, concealed them in a hollow stump back of the barn.At eight o'clock he went to bed as usual.He felt no desire to sleep,
and would not have dared to do so if he had.He heard the old kitchen
clock strike ten.The house was still, for all had long ago retired to
their rest, and he could hear the sonorous snores of the paupers in
the adjoining rooms.It was a
novel position in which he found himself.He had been accustomed to do
everything fairly and "above board," and the thought of rising from
his bed and sneaking out of the house like a thief was repulsive to
him.But it was a good cause, in his estimation, and he did not waste
much sentiment upon the matter.A conspiracy had been formed to cheat
him of his hopes and of his future happiness, and it seemed right to
him that he should flee from those with whom he could not successfully
contend.Carefully and stealthily he crept out of bed, and put on his best
clothes, which were nothing to boast of at that, for there was many a
darn and many a patch upon the jacket and trousers.Stockings and
shoes were luxuries in which Harry was not indulged in the warm
season; but he had a pair of each, which he took under his arm.Like a mouse he crept down stairs, and reached the back door of the
house without having disturbed any of its inmates.There were no locks
on the poorhouse doors, for burglars and thieves never invaded the
home of the stricken, forsaken paupers.The door opened with a sharp creak, and Harry was sure he was
detected.For several minutes he waited, but no sound was heard, and
more carefully he opened the door wide enough to permit his passage
out.He was now in the open air, and a sensation of relief pervaded his
mind.No man was his master in this world, and he had not
learned to think much of the other world.As he passed through the cow
yard he heard the old gray mare whinny, and he could not resist the
temptation to pay her a parting visit.They had been firm friends for
years, and as he entered the barn she seemed to recognize him in the
darkness.I am going away to leave you," said Harry, in low
tones, as he patted the mare upon her neck."I hope they will use you
well.Nason, you have been my best friend.The mare whinnied again, as though she perfectly comprehended this
affectionate speech, and wished to express her sympathy with her young
friend in her own most eloquent language.Perhaps Harry could not
render the speech into the vernacular, but he had a high appreciation
of her good feeling, and repeated his caresses."Good-by, old Prue; but, before I go, I shall give you one more feed
of oats--the very last."The localities of the barn were as familiar to him as those of his own
chamber; and taking the half peck measure, he filled it heaping full
of oats at the grain chest as readily as though it had been clear
daylight."Here, Prue, is the last feed I shall give you"; and he emptied the
contents of the measure into the trough."Good-by, old Prue; I shall
never see you again."The mare plunged her nose deep down into the savory mess, and seemed
for a moment to forget her friend in the selfish gratification of her
appetite.If she had fully realized the unpleasant fact that Harry was
going, perhaps she might have been less selfish, for this was not the
first time she had been indebted to him for extra rations.Passing through the barn, the runaway was again in the open air.Everything looked gloomy and sad to him, and the scene was as solemn
as a funeral.There were no sounds to be heard but the monotonous
chirp of the cricket, and the dismal piping of the frogs in the
meadow.Even the owl and the whip-poor-will had ceased their nocturnal
notes, and the stars looked more gloomy than he had ever seen them
before.There was no time to moralize over these things, though, as he walked
along, he could not help thinking how strange and solemn everything
seemed on that eventful night.It was an epoch in his history; one of
those turning points in human life, when all the works of nature and
art, borrowing the spirit which pervades the soul, assume odd and
unfamiliar forms.Harry was not old enough or wise enough to
comprehend the importance of the step he was taking; still he was
deeply impressed by the strangeness within and without.Taking his bundle from the hollow stump, he directed his steps toward
Pine Pleasant.He walked very slowly, for his feelings swelled within
him and retarded his steps.His imagination was busy with the past, or
wandering vaguely to the unexplored future, which with bright promises
tempted him to press on to the goal of prosperity.He yearned to be a
man; to leap in an instant over the years of discipline, that yawned
like a great gulf between his youth and his manhood.He wanted to be a
man, that his strong arm might strike great blows; that he might win
his way up to wealth and honor.Why couldn't he be a great man like Squire Walker.Squire West
wouldn't sound bad."One has only to be rich in order to be great," thought he."Why can't
I be rich, as well as anybody else?Who was that old fellow that saved
up his fourpences till he was worth a hundred thousand dollars?I can
do it as well as he, though I won't be as mean as they say he was,
anyhow.There are chances enough to get rich, and if I fail in one
thing, why--I can try again."Thus Harry mused as he walked along, and fixed a definite purpose
before him to be accomplished in life.It is true it was not a very
lofty or a very noble purpose, merely to be rich; but he had been
obliged to do his own philosophizing.He had not yet discovered the
true philosopher's stone.He had concluded, like the alchemists of
old, that it was the art of turning anything into gold.The paupers,
in their poverty, had talked most and prayed most for that which they
had not.Wealth was to them the loftiest ideal of happiness, and Harry
had adopted their conclusions.It is not strange, therefore, that
Harry's first resolve was to be a rich man."Seek ye _first_ the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be
added unto you," was a text which he had often heard repeated; but he
did not comprehend its meaning, and he had reversed the proposition,
determined to look out for "all these things" first.The village clock struck eleven, and the peal of the clear notes on
the silent air cut short his meditations, and admonished him to
quicken his pace, or Ben would reach the place of rendezvous before
him.He entered the still shades of Pine Pleasant, but saw nothing of
his confederate.Seating himself on the familiar rock in the river, he
returned to his meditations.He had hardly laid down his first proposition in solving the problem
of his future success, before he was startled by the discovery of a
bright light in the direction of the village.It was plainly a
building on fire, and his first impulse was to rush to the meeting
house and give the alarm; but prudence forbade.His business was with
the great world and the future, not with Redfield and the present.A few moments later the church bell pealed its startling notes, and he
heard the cry of fire in the village.The building, whatever it was,
had become a mass of fierce flames, which no human arm could stay.While he was watching the exciting spectacle, he heard footsteps in
the grove, and Ben Smart, out of breath and nearly exhausted, leaped
upon the rock."So you are here, Harry," gasped he."We have no time to waste now," panted Ben, rousing himself anew.Ben descended to the lower side of the rock, and hauled a small
flat-bottomed boat out of the bushes that grew on the river's brink."Never mind the fire now; jump into the boat, and let us be off."Harry obeyed, and Ben pushed off from the rock.asked Harry, not much pleased either with the
imperative tone or the haughty reserve of his companion.Take the paddle and steer her; the current will take
her along fast enough.I am so tired I can't do a thing more."Harry took the paddle and seated himself in the stern of the boat,
while Ben, puffing and blowing like a locomotive, placed himself at
the bow."Tell me now where the fire is," said Harry, whose curiosity would not
be longer resisted."_Squire Walker's barn._"




CHAPTER IV

IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER IS DIFFICULT AND
DANGEROUS


Harry was astounded at this information.Ben was exhausted, as though
he had been running very hard; besides, he was much agitated--more so
than the circumstances of the occasion seemed to justify.In
connection with the threat which his companion had uttered that day,
these appearances seemed to point to a solution of the burning
building.He readily understood that Ben, in revenge for the indignity
the squire had cast upon him, had set the barn on fire, and was now
running away by the light of it.This was more than he had bargained for.However ill-natured he felt
towards the squire for his proposal to send him to Jacob Wire's, it
never occurred to him to retaliate by committing a crime.His ideas of
Christian charity and of forgiveness were but partially developed; and
though he could not feel right towards his powerful enemy, he felt no
desire to punish him so severely as Ben had done.His companion gave him a short answer, and manifested no disposition
to enlarge upon the subject; and for several minutes both maintained a
profound silence.The boat, drifting slowly with the current, was passing from the pond
into the narrow river, and it required all Harry's skill to keep her
from striking the banks on either side.His mind was engrossed with
the contemplation of the new and startling event which had so suddenly
presented itself to embarrass his future operations.Ben was a
criminal in the eye of the law, and would be subjected to a severe
penalty if detected."I shouldn't have thought you would have done that," Harry observed,
when the silence became painful to him."Well, I can see through a millstone when there is a hole in it.""I didn't say I set the barn afire.""I know you didn't; but you said you meant to pay the squire off for
what he had done to you.""I didn't say I had," answered Ben, who was evidently debating with
himself whether he should admit Harry to his confidence."But didn't you set the barn afire?""Why, I should say you run a great risk.""I see the reason now, why you wouldn't tell me what you was going to
do before.""We are in for it now, Harry.I meant to pay off the squire, and--"

"Then you did set the barn afire?""I didn't say so; and, more than that, I don't mean to say so.If you
can see through a millstone, why, just open your eyes--that's all.""I am sorry you did it, Ben.""No whining, Harry; be a man.""I mean to be a man; but I don't think there was any need of burning
the barn.""I do; I couldn't leave Redfield without squaring accounts with Squire
Walker.""We will go by the river, as far as we can; then take to the road.""But this is George Leman's boat--isn't it?""Of course I did; you don't suppose I should mind trifles at such a
time as this!But he can have it again, when I have done with it.""What was the use of taking the boat?""In the first place, don't you think it is easier to sail in a boat
than to walk?And in the second place, the river runs through the
woods for five or six miles below Pine Pleasant; so that no one will
be likely to see us.It is full of rocks about three
miles down."We can keep her clear of the rocks well enough.When I was down the river last spring, you couldn't see a single rock
above water, and we don't draw more than six inches.""But that was in the spring, when the water was high.I don't believe
we can get the boat through.""Yes, we can; at any rate, we can jump ashore and tow her down,"
replied Ben, confidently, though his calculations were somewhat
disturbed by Harry's reasoning."There is another difficulty, Ben," suggested Harry."O, there are a hundred difficulties; but we mustn't mind them.""They will miss the boat, and suspect at once who has got it.""We shall be out of their reach when they miss it.""I heard George Leman say he was going a fishing in her to-morrow.""Because you didn't tell me what you were going to do."Never mind; it is no use to cry for spilt milk."That we are; and if you only stick by me, it will all come out right.If we get caught, you must keep a stiff upper lip.""And, above all, don't blow on me.""Whatever happens, promise that you will stick by me."On that, we will take a bit of luncheon,
and have a good time of it."As he spoke, Ben drew out from under the seat in the bow a box filled
with bread and cheese."You see we are provisioned for a cruise, Harry," added Ben, as he
offered the contents of the box to his companion."Here is enough to
last us two or three days.""But you don't mean to keep on the river so long as that?""I mean to stick to the boat as long as the navigation will permit,"
replied Ben, with more energy than he had before manifested, for he
was recovering from the perturbation with which the crime he had
committed filled his mind."There is a factory village, with a dam across the river, six or seven
miles below here.""I know it; but perhaps we can get the boat round the dam in the night
time, and continue our voyage below.Don't you remember that piece in
the Reader about John Ledyard--how he went down the Connecticut River
in a canoe?""Yes; and you got your idea from that?""I did; and I mean to have a first rate time of it."Ben proceeded to describe the anticipated pleasures of the river
voyage, as he munched his bread and cheese; and Harry listened with a
great deal of satisfaction.Running away was not such a terrible
thing, after all.It was both business and pleasure, and his
imagination was much inflated by the brilliant prospect before him.There was something so novel and exciting in the affair, that his
first experience was of the most delightful character.He forgot the crime his companion had committed, and had almost come
to regard the burning of the squire's barn as a just and proper
retribution upon him for conspiring against the rights and privileges
of young America.My young readers may not know how easy it is even for a good boy to
learn to love the companionship of those who are vicious, and disposed
to take the road which leads down to moral ruin and death.Those lines
of Pope, which are familiar to almost every school boy, convey a great
truth, and a thrilling warning to those who first find themselves
taking pleasure in the society of wicked men, or wicked boys:

    "Vice is a monster of so frightful mien
     As to be hated, needs but to be seen;
     But seen too oft, familiar with her face,
     We first endure, then pity, then embrace."Now, I have not represented my hero, at this stage of the story, as a
very good boy, and it did not require much time to familiarize him
with the wickedness which was in Ben's heart, and which he did not
take any pains to conceal.The transition from enduring to pitying and
from that to embracing was sudden and easy, if, indeed, there was any
middle passage between the first and last stage.I am sorry to say that an hour's fellowship with Ben, under the
exciting circumstances in which we find them, had led him to think Ben
a very good fellow, notwithstanding the crime he had committed.I
shall do my young reader the justice to believe he hopes Harry will be
a better boy, and obtain higher and nobler views of duty.It must be
remembered that Harry had never learned to "love God and man" on the
knee of an affectionate mother.He had long ago forgotten the little
prayers she had taught him, and none were said at the poorhouse.We
are sorry he was no better; but when we consider under what influences
he had been brought up, it is not strange that he was not a good boy.Above every earthly good, we may be thankful for the blessing of a
good home, where we have been taught our duty to God, to our
fellow-beings, and to ourselves.The young navigators talked lightly of the present and the future, as
the boat floated gently along through the gloomy forest.They heard
the Redfield clock strike twelve, and then one.The excitement had
begun to die out.Harry yawned, for he missed his accustomed sleep,
and felt that a few hours' rest in his bed at the poorhouse was even
preferable to navigating the river at midnight.Ben gaped several
times, and the fun was really getting very stale.Those "who go down to the sea in ships," or navigate the river in
boats, must keep their eyes open.It will never do to slumber at the
helm; and Harry soon had a practical demonstration of the truth of the
proposition.He was so sleepy that he could not possibly keep his eyes
open; and Ben, not having the care of the helm, had actually dropped
off, and was bowing as politely as a French dancing master to his
companion in the stern.They were a couple of smart sailors, and
needed a little wholesome discipline to teach them the duty of those
who are on the watch.The needed lesson was soon administered; for just as Ben was making
one of his lowest bows in his semi-conscious condition, the bow of the
boat ran upon a concealed rock, which caused her to keel over to one
side, and very gently pitch the sleeper into the river.Of course, this catastrophe brought the commander of the expedition to
his senses, and roused the helmsman to a sense of his own delinquency,
though it is clear that, as there were no lighthouses on the banks of
the river, and the intricacies of the channel had never been defined
and charted for the benefit of the adventurous navigator, no human
forethought could have provided against the accident.Harry put the boat about, and assisted his dripping shipmate on board
again.The ducking he had received did not operate very favorably upon
Ben's temper, and he roundly reproached his companion for his
carelessness.The steersman replied with becoming spirit to this
groundless charge, telling him he had better keep his eyes open the
rest of the night.Wet and chilly as he was, Ben couldn't help
growling; and both evidently realized that the affair was not half as
romantic as they had adjudged it to be an hour or two before.If we fail once let us try again--that's all."You want to drown me, don't you?"Harry assured him he did not, and called his attention to the sound of
dashing waters, which could now be plainly heard.They were
approaching the rocks, and it was certain from the noise that
difficult navigation was before them.Harry proposed to haul up by the
river's side, and wait for daylight; to which proposition Ben, whose
ardor was effectually cooled by the bath he had received, readily
assented.Accordingly they made fast the painter to a tree on the shore, and
both of them disembarked.While Harry was gathering up a pile of dead
leaves for a bed, Ben amused himself by wringing out his wet clothes."Suppose we make a fire, Harry?"suggested Ben; and it would certainly
have been a great luxury to one in his damp condition."No; it will betray us," replied Harry, with alarm.It is easy enough for you to talk, who are warm and dry,"
growled Ben."I am going to have a fire, anyhow."Ben had some matches in the boat, and in a
few minutes a cheerful fire blazed in the forest.As the leader of the
enterprise felt its glowing warmth his temper was sensibly impressed,
and he even had the hardihood to laugh at his late misfortune.But
Harry did not care just then whether his companion was pleasant or
sour, for he had stretched himself on his bed of leaves, and was in a
fair way to forget the trials and hardships of the voyage in the deep
sleep which makes it "all night" with a tired boy.After Ben was thoroughly dried and warmed, he placed himself by the
side of his fellow-voyager, and both journeyed together through the
quiet shades of dreamland, leaving no wakeful eye to watch over the
interests of the expedition while they slumbered.CHAPTER V

IN WHICH HARRY FIGHTS A HARD BATTLE, AND IS DEFEATED


The sun was high in the heavens when the tired boatmen awoke.Unaccustomed as they were to fatigue and late hours, they had been
completely overcome by the exertion and exposure of the previous
night.Harry was the first to recover his lost senses; and when he
opened his eyes, everything looked odd and strange to him.It was not
the rough, but neat and comfortable little room in the poorhouse which
greeted his dawning consciousness; it was the old forest and the
dashing river.He did not feel quite at home; the affair had been
divested of its air of romance, and he felt more like a runaway boy
than the hero of a fairy tale.Ben growled once, and then rolled over, as if angry at being
disturbed.We shall be caught if you don't wake up.There, the clock is
striking eight!"and to give Ben a better idea of where he was, he
administered a smart kick in the region of the ribs.snarled Ben, springing to his feet with clinched
fists.Don't you see how high the sun is?We are just as safe here as anywhere else.You
kick me again, and see where you will be!""Come, come, Ben; don't get mad."You do what I tell you, that's all you have to do
with it," replied Ben, imperiously, as he walked to the bank of the
river to survey the difficulties of the navigation.asked Harry, not particularly pleased with this
interpretation of their relations."I don't believe anything of the kind.I ain't your <DW65>, anyhow!""What are you going to do about it?""I'll let you know what I am going to do.""If you don't mind what I tell you, I'll wallop you on the spot.""No, you won't"; and Harry turned on his heel, and leisurely walked
off towards the thickest of the forest."Do you think I'm going to stay with you, to be treated like a dog!"replied Harry, as he continued his retreat.Ben started after him, but Harry picked up a stick of wood and stood
on the defensive."Now, if you don't come back, I'll break your head!""Look out that your own don't get broke"; and Harry brandished his
cudgel in the air.Ben glanced at the club, and saw from the flash of Harry's bright eye
that he was thoroughly aroused.His companion was not to be trifled
with, and he was ready to abandon the point."Come, Harry, it's no use for us to quarrel," he added, with a forced
smile."I know that; but I won't be trod upon by you or anybody else.""I don't want to tread on you.""Yes, you do; you needn't think you are going to lord it over me in
that way.I will go back to the poorhouse first.""Yes, and let you lick me, then!"I won't touch you, Harry; upon my word and honor, I won't."I'll go back, if you'll
behave yourself; but I shall keep the club handy.""Anyway you like; but let us be off."Ben changed his tone, and condescended to tell Harry what he meant to
do, even at the sacrifice of his dignity as commander of the
expedition.An appearance at least of good feeling was restored, and
after breakfasting on their bread and cheese, they embarked again, on
what promised to be a perilous voyage.For a quarter of a mile below, the bed of the narrow river was spotted
with rocks, among which the water dashed with a fury that threatened
the destruction of their frail bark.For a time they seriously debated
the question of abandoning the project, Harry proposing to penetrate
the woods in a northeasterly direction.Ben, however, could not
abandon the prospect of sailing leisurely down the river when they had
passed the rapids, making the passage without any exertion.He was not
pleased with the idea of trudging along on foot for thirty miles, when
the river would bear them to the city with only a little difficulty
occasionally at the rapids and shoal places.Perhaps his plan would
have been practicable at the highest stage of water, but the river was
now below its ordinary level.Ben's love of an easy and romantic time carried the day, and Harry's
practical common-sense reasoning was of no avail, and a taunt at his
cowardice induced him to yield the point."Now, Harry, you take one of the paddles, and place yourself in the
bow, while I steer," said Ben, as he assumed his position."Very well; you shall be captain of the boat, and I will do just as
you say; but I won't be bullied on shore," replied Harry, taking the
station assigned him."All right; now cast off the painter, and let her slide."Never fear me; I will do my share."The boat floated out into the current, and was borne rapidly down the
swift-flowing stream.They were not very skillful boatmen, and it was
more a matter of tact than of strength to keep the boat from dashing
on the sharp rocks.For a little way they did very well, though the
passage was sufficiently exciting to call their powers into action,
and to suggest a doubt as to the ultimate result of the venture.They soon reached a place, however, where the river turned a sharp
angle, and the waters were furiously precipitated down upon a bed of
rocks, which threatened them with instant destruction.exclaimed the foolhardy pilot, as his
eye measured the descent of the waters."Too late now," replied Harry, coolly.But Ben's courage all oozed out, in the face of this imminent peril,
and he made a vain attempt to push the boat toward the shore."Paddle your end round, Harry," gasped Ben, in the extremity of fear."Too late, Ben; stand stiff, and make the best of it," answered Harry,
as he braced himself to meet the shock.The rushing waters bore the boat down the stream in spite of the
feeble efforts of the pilot to check her progress.Ben seemed to have
lost all his self-possession, and stooped down, holding on with both
hands at the gunwale.Down she went into the boiling caldron of waters, roaring and foaming
like a little Niagara.One hard bump on the sharp rocks, and Harry
heard the boards snap under him.He waited for no more, but grasping
the over-hanging branches of a willow, which grew on the bank, and
upon which he had before fixed his eyes as the means of rescuing
himself, he sprang up into the tree, and saw Ben tumbled from the boat
into the seething caldron.But Harry had to save himself first, which, however, was not a
difficult matter.Swinging himself from branch to branch till he
reached the trunk of the willow, he descended to the ground, without
having even wet the soles of his shoes.cried Ben, in piteous accents, as the current bore
him down the stream."Hold on to the boat," replied Harry, "and I will be there in a
minute."Seizing a long pole which had some time formed a part of a fence
there, he hastened down the bank to the water's edge.The water was
not very deep, but it ran so rapidly that Ben could neither swim nor
stand upon the bottom; and but for his companion's promptness he would
undoubtedly have been drowned.Grasping the long pole which Harry
extended to him, he was drawn to the shore, having received no other
injury than a terrible fright and a good ducking."Here we are," said Harry, when his companion was safely landed."Yes, here we are," growled Ben; "and it is all your fault that we are
here.""It is my fault that _you_ are here; for if I had not pulled you out
of the river, you would have been drowned," replied Harry,
indignantly; and perhaps he felt a little sorry just then that he had
rescued his ungrateful commander."Yes, and if you had only done as I told you, and pushed for the shore
above the fall, all this would not have happened.""And if you hadn't been a fool, we should not have tried to go through
such a hole.There goes your old boat"; and Harry pointed to the
wreck, filled with water, floating down the stream.shouted a voice, not far from them."Not yet," replied Harry, with some trepidation, as he broke off a
piece of the pole that lay at his feet, and retreated from the river."Take a club, for I am not going to be carried back without fighting
for it."A survey of the ground and of the pursuers enabled him to prepare for
the future.He discovered at a glance the weakness of the assailants.Don't you see there is only one man on this side of
the river?Ben took the club; but he seemed not to have the energy to use it.In
fact, Harry showed himself better qualified to manage the present
interests of the expedition than his companion.All at once he
developed the attributes of a skillful commander, while his
confederate seemed to have lost all his cunning and all his
determination."Now, let us run; and if we are caught we will fight for it," said
Harry.The boys took to their heels, and having a fair start of their
pursuer, they kept clear of him for a considerable distance; but Ben's
wet clothes impeded his progress, and Harry had too much magnanimity
to save himself at the sacrifice of his companion.It was evident, after the chase had continued a short time, that
their pursuer was gaining upon them.In vain Harry urged Ben to
increase his speed; his progress was very slow, and it was soon
apparent to Harry that they were wasting their breath in running when
they would need it for the fight."Now, Ben, we can easily whip this man, and save ourselves.Be a man,
and let us stand by each other to the last."Ben made no reply; but when Harry stopped, he did the same.or we will knock your brains out," cried Harry, placing
himself in the attitude of defense.But the man took no notice of this piece of bravado; and as he
approached Harry leveled a blow at his head.The man warded it off,
and sprang forward to grasp the little rebel.shouted Harry, as he dodged the swoop of his
assailant.To his intense indignation and disgust, Ben, instead of seconding his
assault, dropped his club and fled.He seemed to run a good deal
faster than he had run before that day; but Harry did not give up the
point.The man pressed him closely, and he defended himself with a
skill and vigor worthy a better cause.But it was of no use; or, if it
was, it only gave Ben more time to effect his escape.The unequal contest, however, soon terminated in the capture of our
resolute hero, and the man tied his hands behind his back; but he did
not dare to leave the young lion to go in pursuit of his less
unfortunate, but more guilty, confederate."There, Master Harry West, I think you have got into a tight place
now," said his captor, whose name was Nathan Leman, brother of the
person to whom the boat belonged."We will soon put you in a place
where you won't burn any more barns."Harry was confounded at this charge, and promptly and indignantly
denied it.He had not considered the possibility of being accused of
such a crime, and it seemed to put a new aspect upon his case."You did not set fire to Squire Walker's barn last night?""Perhaps you can make the squire believe it," sneered his captor."Didn't steal my brother's boat, either, did you?"After the mean trick which Ben Smart had
served him, he did not feel very kindly towards him, but he was not
yet prepared to betray him.Nathan Leman then conducted his prisoner to the river's side.By this
time the other pursuer, who had been obliged to ascend the river for a
quarter of a mile before he could cross, joined him.This one fought like a young tiger, and I
couldn't leave him," replied Nathan."If you will take Harry up to the
village I will soon have him."The other assented, and while Nathan went in search of Ben, Harry was
conducted back to the village.The prisoner was sad and depressed in spirits; but he did not lose all
hope.He was appalled at the idea of being accused of burning the
barn; but he was innocent, and had a vague assurance that no harm
could befall him on that account.When they entered the village, a crowd gathered around them, eager to
learn the particulars of the capture; but without pausing to gratify
this curiosity, Harry's conductor led him to the poorhouse, and placed
him in charge of Mr.CHAPTER VI

IN WHICH HARRY CONCLUDES THAT A DEFEAT IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN A
VICTORY


The keeper of the poorhouse received Harry in sullen silence, and
conducted him to the chamber in which he had been ordered to keep him
a close prisoner.He apparently had lost all confidence in him, and
regretted that he had connived at his escape.Harry did not like the cold and repulsive deportment of his late
friend.Nason had always been kind to him; now he seemed to have
fallen in with Squire Walker's plans, and was willing to be the
instrument of the overseer's narrow and cruel policy.Before, he had
taken his part against the mighty, so far as it was prudent for him to
do so; now, he was willing to go over to the enemy.The reverse made him sadder than any other circumstance of his
return--sadder than the fear of punishment, or even of being sent to
live with Jacob Wire."I've got back again," said Harry, when they reached the chamber in
which he was to be confined.The keeper had never spoken to him in such tones, and Harry burst into
tears.His only friend had deserted him, and he felt more desolate
than ever before in his life."You needn't cry, now," said Mr."I can't help it," sobbed the little prisoner.Nason sneered as he spoke, and his sneer pierced the heart of
Harry.You needn't blubber any more.You have made your
bed, and now you can lie in it;" and the keeper turned on his heel to
leave the room."Don't leave me yet," pleaded Harry.I suppose you want to tell me I
advised you to burn the barn.""I didn't set the barn afire!"exclaimed Harry, now for the first time
realizing the cause of his friend's displeasure.I did not set it afire, or even know that it was
going to be set on fire."Nason closed the door which he had opened to depart.The firm
denial, as well as the tone and manner of the boy, arrested his
judgment against him.He had learned to place implicit confidence in
Harry's word; for, though he might have told lies to others, he never
told them to him.asked the keeper, looking sternly into the
eye of the culprit.A sense of honor and magnanimity pervaded his soul.He had obtained some false notions; and he did not understand that he
could hardly be false to one who had been false to himself--that to
help a criminal conceal his crime was to conspire against the peace
and happiness of his fellow-beings.Shabbily as Ben Smart had used
him, he could not make up his mind to betray him."Very well; you can do as you like.After what I had done for you, it
was a little strange that you should do as you have.""I will tell you all about it, Mr.Nason, if you will promise not to
tell."You and Ben Smart put your heads together to be
revenged on the squire; you set his barn afire, and then stole Leman's
boat.""No, sir; I didn't set the barn afire, nor steal the boat, nor help to
do either.""We were; and if it wasn't for being mean to Ben, I would tell you all
about it."As soon as it was known that you and Ben were missing,
everybody in the village knew who set the barn afire.All you have got
to do is to clear yourself, if you can; Ben is condemned already.""If you will hear my story I will tell you all about it."Harry proceeded to narrate everything that had occurred since he left
the house on the preceding night.It was a very clear and plausible
statement.Nason proposed with
promptness, and his replies were consistent."I believe you, Harry," said the keeper, when he had finished his
examination."Somehow I couldn't believe you would do such a thing as
set the squire's barn afire.""I wouldn't," replied Harry, warmly, and much pleased to find he had
re-established the confidence of his friend.The fact of your being with Ben Smart is almost
enough to convict you.""I shouldn't have been with him, if I had known he set the barn
afire.""I don't know as I can do anything for you, Harry; but I will try."Nason left him, and Harry had an opportunity to consider the
desperate circumstances of his position.It looked just as though he
should be sent to the house of correction.He
felt his innocence; as he expressed it to the keeper afterwards, he
"felt it in his bones."It did not, on further consideration, seem
probable that he would be punished for doing what he had not done,
either as principal or accessory.A vague idea of an all-pervading
justice consoled him; and he soon reasoned himself into a firm
assurance that he should escape unharmed.He was in the mood for reasoning just then--perhaps because he had
nothing better to do, or perhaps because the added experience of the
last twenty-four hours enabled him to reason better than before.His
fine scheme of getting to Boston, and there making a rich and great
man of himself, had signally failed."I have failed once, but I will try again," said he to himself, as the
conclusion of the whole matter; and he picked up an old school book
which lay on the table.The book contained a story, which he had often read, about a man who
had met with a long list of misfortunes, as he deemed them when they
occurred, but which proved to be blessings in disguise."Oft from apparent ills our blessings rise,
     Act well your part; there all the honor lies."This couplet from the school books came to his aid, also; and he
proceeded to make an application of this wisdom to his own mishaps."Suppose I had gone on with Ben.He is a miserable fellow," thought
Harry; "he would have led me into all manner of wickedness.I ought
not to have gone with him, or had anything to do with him.He might
have made a thief and a robber of me.I know I ain't any better than I
should be; but I don't believe I'm as bad as he is.At any rate, I
wouldn't set a barn afire.It is all for the best, just as the parson
says when anybody dies.By this scrape I have got clear of Ben, and
learned a lesson that I won't forget in a hurry."Harry was satisfied with this logic, and really believed that
something which an older and more devout person would have regarded as
a special providence had interposed to save him from a life of infamy
and wickedness.It was a blessed experience, and his thoughts were
very serious and earnest.In the afternoon Squire Walker came down to the poorhouse to subject
Harry to a preliminary examination.Ben Smart had not been taken, and
the pursuers had abandoned the chase."Boy," said the squire, when Harry was brought before him; "look at
me."Harry looked at the overseer with all his might.He had got far enough
to despise the haughty little great man.A taste of freedom had
enlarged his ideas and developed his native independence, so that he
did not quail, as the squire intended he should; on the contrary, his
eyes snapped with the earnestness of his gaze.With an honest and just
man, his unflinching eye would have been good evidence in his favor;
but the pompous overseer wished to awe him, rather than get at the
simple truth."You set my barn on fire," continued the squire."I did not," replied Harry, firmly.He had often read, and heard read, that passage of Scripture which
says, "Let your communication be Yea, yea, Nay, nay; for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil."Just then he felt the truth of the
inspired axiom.It seemed just as though any amount of violent
protestations would not help him; and though the squire repeated the
charge half a dozen times, he only replied with his firm and simple
denial.Then Squire Walker called his hired man, upon whose evidence he
depended for the conviction of the little incendiary.asked the squire, pointing to Harry."No, sir; it was a bigger boy than that," replied John, without
hesitation."It must be that this is the boy," persisted the squire, evidently
much disappointed by the testimony of the man."I am certain it was a bigger boy than this.""I feel pretty clear about it, Mr."You
see, this boy was mad, yesterday, because I wanted to send him to
Jacob Wire's.My barn is burned, and it stands to reason he burned
it.""But I saw the boy round the barn night afore last," interposed John,
who was certainly better qualified to be a justice of the peace than
his employer."I know that; but the barn wasn't burned till last night.""But Harry couldn't have had any grudge against you night before
last," said Mr."I don't know about that," mused the squire, who was apparently trying
to reconcile the facts to his theory, rather than the theory to the
facts.John, the hired man, lived about three miles from the squire's house.His father was very sick; and he had been home every evening for a
week, returning between ten and eleven.On the night preceding the
fire, he had seen a boy prowling round the barn, who ran away at his
approach.The next day, he found a pile of withered grass, dry sticks,
and other combustibles heaped against a loose board in the side of the
barn.He had informed the squire of the facts, but the worthy justice
did not consider them of much moment.Probably Ben had intended to burn the barn then, but had been
prevented from executing his purpose by the approach of the hired man."This must be the boy," added the squire."He had on a sack coat, and was bigger than this boy," replied John."Harry has no sack coat," put in Mr.Nason, eagerly catching at his
evidence."It is easy to be mistaken in the night.Search him, and see if there
are any matches about him."Undoubtedly this was a very brilliant suggestion of the squire's muddy
intellect--as though every man who carried matches was necessarily an
incendiary.But no matches were found upon Harry; and, according to
the intelligent justice's perception of the nature of evidence, the
suspected party should have been acquitted.No matches were found on Harry; but in his jacket pocket, carefully
enclosed in a piece of brown paper, were found the four quarters of a
dollar given to him by Mr."They were given to me," replied Harry.Nason averted his eyes, and was very uneasy.The fact of having
given this money to Harry went to show that he had been privy to his
escape; and his kind act seemed to threaten him with ruin."Answer me," thundered the squire.The boy was as firm as a hero; and no
threats could induce him to betray his kind friend, whose position he
fully comprehended."We will see," roared the squire.Several persons who had been present during the examination, and who
were satisfied that Harry was innocent of the crime charged upon him,
interfered to save him from the consequences of the squire's wrath.Nason, finding that his young friend was likely to suffer for his
magnanimity, explained the matter--thus turning the squire's anger
from the boy to himself."So you helped the boy run away--did you?""He did not; he told me that money would keep me from starving."Those present understood the allusion, and the squire did not press
the matter any further.In the course of the examination, Ben Smart
had often been alluded to, and the crime was fastened upon him.Harry
told his story, which, confirmed by the evidence of the hired man,
was fully credited by all except the squire, who had conceived a
violent antipathy to the boy.The examination was informal; the squire did not hold it as a justice
of the peace, but only as a citizen, or, at most, as an overseer of
the poor.However, it proved that, as the burning of the barn had been
planned before any difficulty had occurred between the squire and
Harry, he had no motive for doing the deed.The squire was not satisfied; but the worst he could do was to commit
Harry to the care of Jacob Wire, which was immediately done."I am sorry for you, Harry," whispered Mr."Never mind; I shall _try again_," he replied, as he jumped into the
wagon with his persecutor.CHAPTER VII

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS HIMSELF IN A TIGHT PLACE AND EXECUTES A COUNTER
MOVEMENT


"Jacob, here is the boy," said Squire Walker, as he stopped his horse
in front of an old, decayed house.Jacob Wire was at work in his garden, by the side of the house; and
when the squire spoke, he straightened his back, regarding Harry with
a look of mingled curiosity and distrust.He looked as though he would eat too much; and to a
man as mean as Jacob, this was the sum total of all enormities.Besides, the little pauper had earned a bad reputation within the
preceding twenty-four hours, and his new master glanced uneasily at
his barn, and then at the boy, as though he deemed it unsafe to have
such a desperate character about his premises."He is a hard boy, Jacob, and will need a little taming.They fed him
too high at the poorhouse," continued the squire."That spoils boys," replied Jacob, solemnly."So, this is the boy that burnt your barn?"Perhaps he
knew about it, though;" and the squire proceeded to give his
brother-in-law the particulars of the informal examination; for Jacob
Wire, who could hardly afford to lie still on Sundays, much less other
days, had not been up to the village to hear the news."You must be pretty sharp with him," said the overseer, in conclusion."Keep your eye on him all the time, for we may want him again, as soon
as they can catch the other boy."Jacob promised to do the best he could with Harry, who, during the
interview, had maintained a sullen silence; and the squire departed,
assured that he had done his whole duty to the public and to the
little pauper."Well, boy, it is about sundown now, and I guess we will go in and get
some supper before we do any more.But let me tell you beforehand, you
must walk pretty straight here, or you will fare hard."Harry vouchsafed no reply to this speech, and followed Jacob into the
house.His first meal at his new place confirmed all he had heard
about the penuriousness of his master.There was very little to eat on
the table, but Mrs.Wire gave him the poorest there was--a hard crust
of brown bread, a cold potato, and a dish of warm water with a very
little molasses and milk in it, which he was expected to imagine was
tea.He was too sad and depressed, and
probably if the very best had been set before him he would have been
equally indifferent.He ate very little, and Jacob felt more kindly towards him than before
this proof of the smallness of his appetite.He had been compelled to
get rid of his last boy, because he was a little ogre, and it seemed
as though he would eat him out of house and home.After supper Harry assisted Jacob about the barn, and it was nearly
eight o'clock before they finished."Now, boy, it is about bed time, and I will show you your rooms, if
you like," said Jacob."Before you go, let me tell you it won't do any
good to try to run away from here, for I am going to borrow Leman's
bull-dog."Harry made no reply to this remark, and followed his master to the low
attic of the house, where he was pointed to a rickety bedstead, which
he was to occupy."There, jump into bed afore I carry the candle off," continued Jacob.You needn't wait," replied Harry, as he
slipped off his shoes and stockings."That is right; boys always ought to be learnt to go to bed in the
dark," added Jacob, as he departed.But Harry was determined not to go to bed in the dark; so, as soon as
he heard Jacob's step on the floor below, he crept to the stairway,
and silently descended.He had made up his mind not to wait for the
bull-dog.Pausing in the entry, he heard Jacob tell his wife that he
was going over to Leman's to borrow his dog; he was afraid the boy
would get up in the night and set his barn on fire, or run away.Jacob
then left the house, satisfied, no doubt, that the bull-dog would be
an efficient sentinel while the family were asleep.After allowing time enough to elapse for Jacob to reach Leman's house,
he softly opened the front door and went out.Wire was as "deaf as a post," or his suddenly matured plan
to "try again" might have been a failure.As it was, his departure was
not observed.It was quite dark, and after he had got a short distance
from the house, he felt a reasonable degree of security.His first purpose was to get as far away from Redfield as possible
before daylight should come to betray him; and, taking the road, he
walked as fast as his legs would carry him towards Boston.Jacob's
house was on the turnpike, which was the direct road to the city, and
the distance which the squire had carried him in his wagon was so much
clear gain.The sky was overshadowed with
clouds, so that he could not see any stars, and the future did not
look half so bright as his fancy had pictured it on the preceding
night.But he was free again; and free under more favorable
circumstances than before.This time he was himself commander of the
expedition, and was to suffer for no one's bad generalship but his
own.Besides, the experience he had obtained was almost a guarantee of
success.It had taught him the necessity of care and prudence.The moral lesson he had learned was of infinitely more value than even
the lesson of policy.For the first time in his life he was conscious
of a deep and earnest desire to be a good boy, and to become a true
man.As he walked along, he thought more of being a good man than of
being a rich man.It was very natural for him to do so, under the
circumstances, for he had come very near being punished as an
incendiary.The consequences of doing wrong were just then strongly
impressed upon his mind, and he almost shuddered to think he had
consented to remain with Ben Smart after he knew that he burned the
barn.Ah, it was an exceedingly fortunate thing for him that he had
got rid of Ben as he did.For two hours he walked as fast as he could, pausing now and then to
listen for the sound of any approaching vehicle.Possibly Jacob might
have gone to his room, or attic, to see if he was safe, and his escape
had been discovered.He could not be too wary, and every sound that
reached his waiting ear caused his heart to jump with anxiety.It was not the Redfield clock, and it
was evident that he was approaching Rockville, a factory village eight
miles from his native place.He was
exhausted by the labors and the excitement of the day and night, and
his strength would hardly hold out till he should get beyond the
village.Seating himself on a rock by the side of the road, he decided to hold
a council of war, to determine what should be done.If he went
forward, his strength might fail him at the time when a vigorous
effort should be required of him.Somebody's dog might bark, and bring
the "Philistines upon him."He might meet some late walker, who would
detain him.It was hardly safe for him to go through the village by
night or day, after the search which had been made for Ben Smart.People would be on the lookout, and it would be no hard matter to
mistake him for the other fugitive.On the other hand, he did not like to pause so near Redfield.He had
scarcely entered upon the consideration of this side of the question
before his quick ear detected the sound of rattling wheels in the
direction from which he had come.It was
Squire Walker and Jacob Wire, he was sure, in pursuit of him; but his
courage did not fail him.Leaping over the stone wall by the side of the road, he secured the
only retreat which the vicinity afforded, and waited, with his heart
in his throat, for the coming of his pursuers, as he had assured
himself they were.The present seemed to be his only chance of escape,
and if he failed now, he might not soon have another opportunity to
"try again."The vehicle was approaching at a furious pace, and as the noise grew
more distinct, his heart leaped the more violently.He thought he
recognized the sound of Squire Walker's wagon.There was not much time
for his fancy to conjure up strange things, for the carriage soon
reached the place where he was concealed.said a big bull-dog, placing his ugly nose against the
wall, behind which Harry was lying.added a voice, which the trembling fugitive recognized as that
of George Leman."The dog has scented him," said another--that of Jacob Wire.Harry's heart sank within him, and he felt as faint as though every
drop of blood had been drawn from his veins."I knew the dog would fetch him," said George Leman, as he leaped from
the wagon, followed by Jacob Wire.In obedience to this command, Tiger drew back a few steps, and then
leaped upon the top of the wall.The prospect of being torn to pieces
by the bull-dog was not pleasant to Harry, and with a powerful effort
he summoned his sinking energies for the struggle before him.Grasping
two large stones, he stood erect as the dog leaped on the wall.Inspired by the imminence of his peril, he hurled one of the stones at
Tiger the instant he showed his ugly visage above the fence.The
missile took effect upon the animal, and he was evidently much
astonished at this unusual mode of warfare.Tiger was vanquished, and
fell back from the wall, howling with rage and pain.exclaimed Leman, as he jumped over
the wall.Harry did not wait any longer, but took to his heels, followed by both
pursuers, though not by the dog, which was _hors de combat_.Our hero
was in a "tight place," but with a heroism worthy the days of
chivalry, he resolved not to be captured.He had not run far, however, before he realized that George Leman was
more than a match for him, especially in his present worn-out
condition.He was almost upon him, when Harry executed a counter
movement, which was intended to "outflank" his adversary.Dodging
round a large rock in the field, he redoubled his efforts, running now
towards the road where the horse was standing.Leman was a little
confused by this sudden action, and for an instant lost ground.Harry reached the road and leaped the wall at a single bound; it was a
miracle that, in the darkness, he had not dashed his brains out upon
the rocks, in the reckless leap.The horse was startled by the noise,
and his snort suggested a brilliant idea to Harry.he shouted; and the horse started towards Rockville at a
round pace.Harry jumped into the wagon over the hind board, and grasping the
reins, put the high-mettled animal to the top of his speed.The horse manifested no feeling of partiality toward either of the
parties, and seemed as willing to do his best for Harry as for his
master.shouted George Leman, astounded at the new phase which
the chase had assumed.It was natural that he should prefer to let
the fugitive escape, to the alternative of losing his horse.George
Leman was noted for three things in Redfield--his boat, his ugly dog,
and his fast horse; and Harry, after stealing the boat and killing the
dog, was in a fair way to deprive him of his horse, upon which he set
a high value.The boy seemed like his evil genius, and no doubt he was
angry with himself for letting so mean a man as Jacob Wire persuade
him to hunt down such small game.Harry did not deem it prudent to stop, and in a few moments had left
his pursuers out of sight.He had
played a desperate game, and won the victory; yet he did not feel like
indulging in a triumph.The battle had been a bitter necessity, and he
even regretted the fate of poor Tiger, whose ribs he had stove in with
a rock.All was still, save the roaring of the
waters at the dam, and no one challenged him."I am safe, at any rate," said he to himself, when he had passed the
village."What will be the next scrape, I wonder?They
will have me up for stealing a horse next.George Leman is a good fellow, and only for the fun of the thing, he
wouldn't have come out on such a chase.Harry hauled up by the roadside, and fastened the horse to the fence."There, George, you can have your horse again; but I will just put the
blanket over him, for he is all of a reeking sweat.It will just show
George, when he comes up, that I don't mean him any harm.Taking the blanket which lay in the bottom of the wagon (for George
Leman was very careful of his horse, and though it was October, always
covered him when he let him stand out at night), he spread it over
him."Now, for Number One again," muttered Harry."I must take to the
woods, though I doubt if George will follow me any farther."So saying, he got over the fence, and made his way across the fields
to the woods, which were but a short distance from the road.CHAPTER VIII

IN WHICH HARRY KILLS A BIG SNAKE, AND MAKES A NEW FRIEND


Harry was not entirely satisfied with what he had done.He regretted
the necessity which had compelled him to take George Leman's horse.It
looked too much like stealing; and his awakened moral sense repelled
the idea of such a crime.But they could not accuse him of stealing
the horse; for his last act would repudiate the idea.His great resolution to become a good and true man was by no means
forgotten.It is true, at the very outset of the new life he had
marked out for himself, he had been obliged to behave like a young
ruffian, or be restored to his exacting guardians.It was rather a bad
beginning; but he had taken what had appeared to him the only course.On the solution of this problem
depended the moral character of the subsequent acts.If it was right
for him to run away, why, of course it was right for him to resist
those who attempted to restore him to Jacob Wire.Harry made up his mind that it was right for him to run away, under
the circumstances.His new master had been charged to break him
down--even to starve him down.Jacob's reputation as a mean and hard
man was well merited; and it was his duty to leave without stopping to
say good by.I do not think that Harry was wholly in the right, though I dare say
all my young readers will sympathize with the stout-hearted little
hero.So far, Jacob Wire had done him no harm.He had suffered no
hardship at his hands.All his misery was in the future; and if he had
stayed, perhaps his master might have done well by him, though it is
not probable.Still, I think Harry was in some sense justifiable.To
remain in such a place was to cramp his soul, as well as pinch his
body--to be unhappy, if not positively miserable.He might have tried
the place, and when he found it could not be endured, fled from it.It must be remembered that Harry was a pauper and an orphan.He had
not had the benefit of parental instruction.It was not from the home
of those whom God had appointed to be his guardians and protectors
that he had fled; it was from one who regarded him, not as a rational
being, possessed of an immortal soul--one for whose moral, mental, and
spiritual welfare he was accountable before God--that he had run away,
but from one who considered him as a mere machine, from which it was
his only interest to get as much work at as little cost as possible.He fled from a taskmaster, not from one who was in any just sense a
guardian.Harry did not reason out all this; he only felt it.What did they care
about his true welfare?Harry so understood it, and acted
accordingly.But his heart was
stout; and the events of the last chapter inspired him with confidence
in his own abilities.He entered the dark woods, and paused to rest
himself.While he was discussing this question in his own mind he heard the
sound of voices on the road, which was not more than fifty rods
distant.In a few minutes he heard
the sound of wagon wheels; and soon had the satisfaction of knowing
that his pursuers had abandoned the chase and were returning home.The little fugitive was very tired and very sleepy.It was not
possible for him to continue his journey, and he looked about him for
a place in which to lodge.The night was chilly and damp; and as he
sat upon the rock, he shivered with cold.It would be impossible to
sleep on the wet ground; and if he could, it might cost him his life.It was a pine forest; and there were no leaves on the ground, so that
he could not make such a bed as that in which he had slept the
previous night.He was so cold that he was obliged to move about to get warm.It
occurred to him that he might get into some barn in the vicinity, and
nestle comfortably in the hay; but the risk of being discovered was
too great, and he directed his steps towards the depths of the forest.After walking some distance, he came to an open place in the woods.The character of the growth had changed, and the ground was covered
with young maples, walnuts and oaks.The wood had been recently cut
off over a large area, but there were no leaves of which he could make
a bed.Fortune favored him, however; for, after advancing half way across the
open space he reached one of those cabins erected for the use of men
employed to watch coal pits.It was made of board slabs, and covered
with sods.Near it was the circular place on which the coal pit had
burned.At the time of which I write, charcoal was carried to Boston from many
towns within thirty miles of the city.Perhaps my young readers may
never have seen a coal pit.The wood is set up on the ends of the
sticks, till a circular pile from ten to twenty feet in diameter is
formed and two tiers in height.Its shape is that of a cone, or a
sugar loaf.Fire is
communicated to the wood, so that it shall smoulder, or burn slowly,
without blazing.Just enough air is admitted to the pit to keep the
fire alive.If the air were freely admitted the pile would burn to
ashes.Sometimes the outer covering of dirt and sods falls in, as the
wood shrinks permitting the air to rush in and fan the fire to a
blaze.When this occurs, the aperture must be closed, or the wood
would be consumed; and it is necessary to watch it day and night.The
cabin had been built for the comfort of the men who did this duty.Harry's heart was filled with gratitude when he discovered the rude
hut.If it had been a palace, it could not have been a more welcome
retreat.It is true the stormy wind had broken down the door, and the
place was no better than a squirrel hole; yet it suggested a thousand
brilliant ideas of comfort, and luxury even, to our worn-out and
hunted fugitive.The floor was covered with straw, which
completed his ideal of a luxurious abode.Raising up the door, which
had fallen to the ground, he placed it before the aperture--thus
excluding the cold air from his chamber."I'm a lucky fellow," exclaimed Harry, as he threw himself on the
straw."This place will be a palace beside Jacob Wire's house.And I
can stay here a month, if I like."Nestling closely under the side of the hut, he pulled the straw over
him, and soon began to feel perfectly at home.The commissary department of the establishment could not
be relied on.There were no pork and potatoes in the house, no
well-filled grain chest, no groceries, not even a rill of pure water
at hand.This was an unpromising state of things; and he began to see
that there would be no fun in living in the woods, where the butcher
and the baker would not be likely to visit him.There
were rabbits, partridges, and quails in the woods; he might set a
snare, and catch some of them.But he had no fire to cook them; and
Dr.Kane had not then demonstrated the healthy and appetizing
qualities of raw meat.The orchards in the neighborhood were
accessible; but prudence seemed to raise an impassable barrier between
him and them.While he was thus considering these matters, he dropped asleep, and
forgot all about his stomach.He was completely exhausted; and no
doubt the owls and bats were astonished as they listened to the
sonorous sounds that came from the deserted cabin.The birds sang their mating songs on the
tree tops; but he heard them not.The sun rose, and penetrated the
chinks of the hut; but the little wanderer still slumbered.The
Rockville clock struck nine; and he heard it not.I think it was Harry's grumbling stomach that finally waked him; and
it was no wonder that neglected organ grew impatient under the injury
put upon it, for Harry had eaten little or nothing since his dinner at
the poorhouse on the preceding day.Jumping out of the heap of straw in which he had "cuddled" all night
scarcely without moving, he left the hut to reconnoitre his position.So far as security was concerned, it seemed to be a perfectly safe
place.He could see nothing of the village of Rockville, though,
beyond the open space, he saw the top of a chimney; but it was at
least half a mile distant.Just then he did not feel much interested in the scenery and natural
advantages of the position.His stomach was imperative, and he was
faint from the want of food.Berry time was past; and the prospect of supplying his wants was very
discouraging.Leaving the cabin, he walked towards the distant chimney
that peered above the tree tops.It belonged to a house that "was set
on a hill, and could not be hid."After going a little way, he came to a cart path, which led towards
the house.This he followed, descending a hill into a swamp, which was
covered over with alders and birches.At the foot of the declivity he
heard the rippling of waters; but the bushes concealed the stream from
his view.He had descended nearly to the foot of the hill when the sound of
footsteps reached his ears.His heart beat quick with apprehension,
and he paused to listen.The step was soft and light; it was not a
man's, and his courage rose.Pat, pat, pat, went the steps on the
leafy ground, so gently that his fears were conquered; for the person
could be only a child.Suddenly a piercing shriek saluted his ears.Something had occurred to
alarm the owner of the fairy feet which made the soft pat, pat, on the
ground.Another shriek, and Harry bounded down the road like an
antelope, heedless of the remonstrances of his grumbling stomach.shouted a voice, which Harry perceived was that of a
little girl.In a moment more he discovered the young lady running with all her
might towards him.But Harry had scarcely asked the question before he saw what had
alarmed her.Under other circumstances he would have quailed himself;
for, as he spoke, a great black snake raised his head two or three
feet from the ground directly in front of him.He was an ugly-looking
monster, and evidently intended to attack him.All the chivalry of
Harry's nature was called up to meet the emergency of the occasion.Seizing a little stick that lay in the path, he struck sundry
vigorous blows at the reptile, which, however, seemed only to madden,
without disabling him.Several times he elevated his head from the
ground to strike at his assailant; but the little knight was an old
hand with snakes, and vigorously repelled his assaults.At last, he
struck a blow which laid out his snakeship; and the field was won,
when Harry had smashed his head with a large rock.The reptile was
about four feet and a half long, and as big round as a small boy's
wrist."There, miss, he won't hurt you now," said Harry, panting with his
exertions.The little girl ventured to approach the dead body of the snake, and
satisfied herself that he could not harm her.I was crossing the brook at the foot of the hill,
when he sprang out from beneath my feet and chased me.I never was so
frightened in all my life," said the little miss.asked she, with
childish simplicity.Harry did not like to answer that question, and made no reply."No; I used to live in Redfield."The little girl wanted to laugh then, it seemed such a funny answer.But, little girl, I don't want you to tell any one that
you have seen me.asked the maiden, with a stare of
astonishment.I am a poor boy, and have run away from a hard
master."How lucky that I have lots of goodies in my basket!""I haven't eat anything since yesterday noon," replied Harry, as he
took a handful of doughnuts she handed him."Sit down on this rock, and do eat all you want.I never knew what it
was to be very hungry."Harry seated himself, and proceeded to devour the food the
sympathizing little maiden had given him, while she looked on with
astonishment and delight as he voraciously consumed cake after cake,
without seeming to produce any effect upon the "abhorred vacuum."CHAPTER IX

IN WHICH HARRY BREAKFASTS ON DOUGHNUTS, AND FINDS THAT ANGELS DO NOT
ALWAYS HAVE WINGS


Harry was very hungry, and the little girl thought he would never have
eaten enough.Since he had told her he had run away, she was deeply
interested in him, and had a hundred questions to ask; but she did not
wish to bother him while he was eating, he was so deeply absorbed in
the occupation.laughed she, as Harry leveled on
the sixth cake."I never thought much of them before, but I never
shall see a doughnut again without thinking of you."Our hero was perfectly willing to believe that doughnuts were a very
beneficent institution; but just then he was too busily occupied to be
sentimental over them.asked Harry as he crammed half of
the cake into his mouth."I have a great mind not to tell you, because you wouldn't tell me
what yours is," replied she, roguishly.I have run away from--well, from
somewhere."But, as you killed
the snake, I shall tell you."Mine is Harry West," replied he, unable to resist the little lady's
argument."You must not tell any one about me for three days, for then
I shall be out of the way."They say that none but bad boys run away.I hope you are not
a bad boy.""I don't think you are, either."It was a hearty endorsement, and Harry's heart warmed as she spoke.The little maiden was not more than nine or ten years old, but she
seemed to have some skill in reading faces; at least, Harry thought
she had.Whatever might be said of himself, he was sure she was a good
girl.In short, though Harry had never read a novel in his life, she
was a little angel, even if she had no wings.He even went so far as
to believe she was a little angel, commissioned by that mysterious
something, which wiser and more devout persons would have called a
special providence, to relieve his wants with the contents of her
basket, and gladden his heart by the sunshine of her sweet smile.There is something in goodness which always finds its way to the face.It makes little girls look prettier than silks, and laces, and
ribbons, and embroidery.Harry
thought so; but very likely it was the doughnuts and her kind words
which constituted her beauty."I am pretty sure I am not a bad boy," continued Harry; "but I will
tell you my own story, and you shall judge for yourself.""You will tell me all of it--won't you?""To be sure I will," replied Harry, a little tartly, for he
misapprehended Julia's meaning.He thought she was afraid he would not tell his wrong acts; whereas
her deep interest in him rendered her anxious to have the whole, even
to the smallest particulars.I do so love to hear a good story!""You shall have it all; but where were you going?"I was going to carry these doughnuts to Mrs.She is a poor
widow, who lives over the back lane.She has five children, and has
very hard work to get along.added Harry, who could understand and
appreciate kindness to the poor.Lane says I am," replied Julia,
with a blush."Aunty Gray, over to the poorhouse, used to call everybody an angel
that brought her anything good.I am dying to hear your story," interposed
Julia, as she seated herself on another rock, near that occupied by
Harry."Here goes, then"; and Harry proceeded with his tale, commencing back
beyond his remembrance with the traditionary history which had been
communicated to him by Mr.When he came to the period of authentic history, or that which was
stored up in his memory, he grew eloquent, and the narrative glowed
with the living fire of the hero.Julia was quite as much interested
as Desdemona in the story of the swarthy Moor.His "round, unvarnished
tale," adorned only with the flowers of youthful simplicity, enchained
her attention, and she "loved him for the dangers he had passed;"
loved him, not as Desdemona loved, but as a child loves.She was sure
now that he was not a bad boy; that even a good boy might do such a
thing as run away from cruel and exacting guardians.How near you came to being drowned in
the river!And then they wanted
to send you to prison for setting the barn afire!"exclaimed Julia,
when he had finished the story."I came pretty near it; that's a fact!"replied Harry, warming under
the approbation of his partial auditor."I don't know; I hope I didn't."But what are you going to do next,
Harry?""What will you do when you get there?""You are not big enough to work much."For some time longer they discussed Harry's story, and Julia regretted
the necessity of leaving him to do her errand at Mrs.She
promised to see him when she returned, and Harry walked down to the
brook to get a drink, while she continued on her way.Our hero was deeply interested in the little girl.Like the "great
guns" in the novels, he was sure she was no ordinary character.He was
fully satisfied in relation to the providential nature of their
meeting.She had been sent by that incomprehensible something to
furnish him with food, and he trembled when he thought what might have
happened if she had not come."I can't be a very bad boy," thought he, "or she would not have liked
me.Nason used to say he could tell an ugly horse by the looks of
his eye; and the schoolmaster last winter picked out all the bad boys
at a glance.I can't be a very bad boy, or she would have found me
out.I _know_ I am not a bad boy.I feel right, and try to do right."Harry's investigation invested Julia Bryant with a thousand poetical
excellences.That she felt an interest in him--one so good as she--was
enough to confirm all the noble resolutions he had made, and give him
strength to keep them; and as he seated himself by the brook, he
thought over his faults, and renewed his determination to uproot them
from his character.His meeting with the "little angel," as he chose
to regard her, was an oasis in the desert--a place where his moral
nature could drink the pure waters of life.No one had ever before seemed to care much whether he was a good boy
or a bad boy.The minister used now and then to give him a dry
lecture; but he did not seem to feel any real interest in him.He was
minister, and of course he must preach; not that he cared whether a
pauper boy was a saint or a sinner, but only to do the work he was
hired to do, and earn his money.Her sweet face was the "beauty of holiness."She
hoped he was not a bad boy.She liked a good boy; and this was
incentive enough to incur a lifetime of trial and self-sacrifice.To have one feel an interest in his moral
welfare, to have one wish him to be a good boy, had not grown stale by
long continuance.He had known no anxious mother, who wished him to be
good, who would weep when he did wrong.The sympathy of the little
angel touched a sensitive chord in his heart and soul, and he felt
that he should go forward in the great pilgrimage of life with a new
desire to be true to himself, and true to her who had inspired his
reverence.Even a child cannot be good without having it felt by others."She
hoped he was not a bad boy," were the words of the little angel; and
before she returned from her errand of mercy, he repeated them to
himself a hundred times.They were a talisman to him, and he was sure
he should never be a bad boy in the face of such a wish.He wandered about the woods for two or three hours, impatient for the
return of the little rural goddess who had taken possession of his
thoughts, and filled his soul with admiration.She came at last, and
glad was the welcome which he gave her."I have been thinking of you ever since I left you," said Julia, as
she approached the place where he had been waiting her return."I hope you didn't think of me as a bad boy," replied he, giving
expression to that which was uppermost in his mind.I am sure you must be a good boy.""I am glad you think so; and that will help me be a good boy.""I never had any one to care whether I was good or bad.If you do, you
will be the first one."She had a father and mother who loved her,
and prayed for her every day.It seemed hard that poor Harry should
have no mother to love him as her mother loved her; to watch over him
day and night, to take care of him when he was sick, and, above all,
to teach him to be good.She pitied the lonely orphan, and would
gladly have taken him to her happy home, and shared with him all she
had, even the love of her mother."But I have been thinking of something," she
added, in more sprightly tones."If you would only let me tell my father that you are here--"

"Not for the world!""O, I won't say a word, unless you give me leave; but my father is
rich.He owns a great factory and a great farm.He has lots of men to
work for him; and my father is a very good man, too.People will do as
he wants them to do, and if you will let me tell him your story, he
will go over to Redfield and make them let you stay at our house.You
shall be my brother then, and we can do lots of things together."I don't think it would be safe.I know Squire Walker wouldn't let me
go to any place where they would use me well.""No; I think I will go on to Boston.""You will have a very hard time of it.""If they do, I shall try again.""If they do catch you, will you let my father know it?He will be your
friend, for my friends are his friends."I should be very glad to have such a friend."Daniel went to the bathroom.said Julia, as Harry heard the distant
sound.I may never see you again," added Harry, sadly.When you get big you must come to
Rockville.""You will not wish to see the little poorhouse boy, then."I shall always be glad to see the boy that killed that
snake!But I shall come up after dinner, and bring you something to
eat."Suppose she asks me what I am going to do with the dinner I shall
bring you?I would rather not have any dinner than have
_you_ tell a lie."Harry would not always have been so nice about a lie; but for the
little angel to tell a falsehood, why, it seemed like mud on a white
counterpane."I won't tell a lie, but you shall have your dinner.Harry watched the retreating form of his kind friend, till she
disappeared beyond the curve of the path, and his blessing went with
her.CHAPTER X

IN WHICH HARRY FARES SUMPTUOUSLY, AND TAKES LEAVE OF THE LITTLE ANGEL


When Harry could no longer see the little angel, he fixed his eyes
upon the ground, and continued to think of her.It is not every day
that a pauper boy sees an angel, or even one whom the enthusiasm of
the imagination invests with angelic purity and angelic affections.In the records of individual experience, as well as in the history of
the world, there are certain points of time which are rendered
memorable by important events.By referring to a chronological table,
the young reader will see the great events which have marked the
progress of civilized nations from the lowest depths of barbarism up
to their present enlightened state.Every individual, if he had the
requisite wisdom, could make up a list of epochs in his own
experience.Perhaps he would attach too little importance to some
things, too much to others; for we cannot always clearly perceive the
influences which assist in forming the character.Some trivial event,
far back in the past, which inspired him with a new reverence for
truth and goodness, may be forgotten.The memory may not now cherish
the look, the smile of approbation, which strengthened the heart, when
it was struggling against the foe within; but its influence was none
the less potent."It is the last pound which breaks the camel's back;"
and that look, that smile, may have closed the door of the heart
against a whole legion of evil spirits, and thus turned a life of woe
and bitterness into a life of sunshine and happiness.There are hundreds of epochs in the experience of every person, boy or
man--events which raised him up or let him down in the scale of moral
existence.Harry West had now reached one of these epochs in his
pilgrimage.To meet a little girl in the woods, to kill a black snake, and thus
relieve her from a terrible fright, to say the least, was not a great
event, as events are reckoned in the world; yet it was destined to
exert a powerful influence upon his future career.It was not the
magnitude of the deed performed, or the chivalrous spirit which called
it forth, that made this a memorable event to Harry; it was the angel
visit--the kindling influence of a pure heart that passed from her to
him.But I suppose the impatient reader will not thank me for
moralizing over two whole pages, and I leave the further application
of the moral to the discretion of my young friends.Harry felt strangely--more strangely than he had ever felt before.As
he walked back to the cabin everything seemed to have assumed a new
appearance.Somehow the trees did not look as they used to look.His being seemed to have undergone a
change.He could not account for it; perhaps he did not try.He entered the cabin; and, without dropping the train of thought which
Julia's presence suggested, he busied himself in making the place more
comfortable.He shook up the straw, and made his bed, stuffed dried
grass into the chinks and crannies in the roof, fastened the door up
with some birch withes, and replaced some of the stones of the chimney
which had fallen down.This work occupied him for nearly two hours,
though, so busy were his thoughts, they seemed not more than half an
hour.He had scarcely finished these necessary repairs before he heard the
light step of her who fed him, as Elijah was fed by the ravens, for it
seemed like a providential supply.She saw him at the door of the
cabin; and she no longer dallied with a walk, but ran with all her
might."O, Harry, I am so glad!"she cried, out of breath, as she handed him
a little basket, whose contents were carefully covered with a piece of
brown paper.asked Harry, smiling from sympathy with her."I have heard all about it; and I am so glad you are a good boy!"exclaimed she, panting like a pretty fawn which had gamboled its
breath away."Father has seen and talked with--who was he?"How could he tell whom her father had seen and talked
with?"The man that owned the dog, and the horse and the boat."George Leman," replied Harry, now deeply interested in the little
maiden's story.But I have brought you some dinner; and while you
are eating it, I will tell you all about it.Come, there is a nice big
rock--that shall be your table."Julia, full of excitement, seized the basket, and ran to the rock, a
little way from the cabin.Pulling off half a dozen great oak leaves
from a shrub, she placed them on the rock."Here is a piece of meat, Harry, on this plate," she continued,
putting it on an oak leaf; "here is a piece of pie; here is some bread
and butter; here is cheese; and here is a piece of cold apple pudding."Never mind the sauce," said Harry; and he could hardly keep from
bursting into tears, as he saw how good the little angel was.It seemed as though she could not have been more an angel, if she had
had a pair of wings.The radiant face was there; the pure and loving
heart was there; all was there but the wings, and he could easily
imagine them.He was not much
accustomed to such luxuries; but just then he did not appreciate the
sumptuousness of the feast, for it was eclipsed by the higher
consideration of the devotion of the giver."So am I. If you feed me as high as this, I shall want to stay here a
good while.""Only to-day; to-morrow I must be moving towards Boston.""I was hoping you would stay here a good long while.I shall be so
pleased to bring you your breakfast, and dinner, and supper every
day!""I don't know why he shouldn't.You are not very hungry; you don't eat
as you did this morning."Tell me, now, what your father said, Julia.""He saw George Leman; and he told him how you tied his horse to the
fence, and how careful you were to put the blanket on him, so that he
shouldn't catch cold after his hard run.That was very kind of you,
Harry, when you knew they were after you.Father said almost any one
would have run the horse till he dropped down.That one thing showed
that you were not a bad boy.""I wouldn't have injured George Leman for anything," added Harry."He's a good fellow, and never did me any harm.""He said, when he found his horse, he was so glad he wouldn't have
chased you any farther for all the world.Nason said about you--that you were a good boy, had good feelings, and
were willing to work.He didn't blame you for not wanting to go to
Jacob Wire's--wasn't that the man?""And he didn't blame you for running away.Nobody believes that you
set the barn afire; and, Harry, they have caught the other boy--Ben
Smart, wasn't it?""They caught him in the woods, over the other side of the river.""Did you find out whether the dog was killed?"Leman said he thought he would get over it; and he has got his
boat again.""I am glad of that; and if anybody ever catches me with such a fellow
as Ben Smart again, they'll know it.""You can't think how I wanted to tell father where you were, when he
spoke so well of you.He even said he hoped you would get off, and
that you must be in the woods around here somewhere.You will let me
tell him now--won't you, Harry?""He may hope I will get off, and still not be willing to help me off."Julia looked very much disappointed; for she had depended upon
surprising her father with the story of the snake, and the little
fugitive in the woods."He will be very good to you," pleaded she."I dare say he would; but he may think it his duty to send me back to
Redfield; and Squire Walker would certainly make me go to Jacob
Wire's.""I'm afraid you will never get to Boston."I don't think it is safe for me to stay here much
longer."Hardly any one ever goes through the woods here at this time
of year but myself.""Didn't your mother want to know what you were going to do with the
dinner you brought me?""No, I went to the store room, and got it.She didn't see me; but I
don't like to do anything unknown to her.""You have brought enough to last me while I stop here.To-morrow
morning I must start; so I suppose I shall not see you again.But I
shall never forget you," said Harry looking as sad as he felt."No, you mustn't go off without any breakfast.Promise me you will not
go till I have brought you some."Harry assured Julia he had enough, and tried to persuade her not to
bring him any more food; but Julia was resolute, and he was obliged to
promise.Having finished his dinner, she gathered up the remnants of
the feast and put them in the cabin for his supper.She was afraid to
remain any longer, lest she might be missed at home and Harry
gallantly escorted her beyond the brook on her return home.He busied himself during the greater part of the afternoon in
gathering dry grass and dead leaves for the improvement of his bed in
the cabin.About an hour before sundown, he was surprised to receive
another visit from Julia Bryant.She had her little basket in one
hand, and in the other she carried a little package."I didn't expect to see you again," said Harry, as she approached."I don't know as you will like what I have done," she began timidly;
"but I did it for the best.""I shall like anything you have done," answered Harry promptly, "even
if you should send me back to Redfield.""I wouldn't do such a mean thing as that; but I have told somebody
that you are here.""You will forgive me if I have done wrong--won't you?"He mistook her anxious appearance for sorrow at
what she had done.He could not give her pain; so he told her that,
whatever she had done, she was forgiven.He drives the baggage wagon that goes to
Boston every week.He promised not to lisp a word to a single soul,
and he would be your friend for my sake.""Well, you see, I was afraid you would never get to Boston; and I
thought what a nice thing it would be if you could only ride all the
way there with John Lane.John likes me because I carry things to his
mother, and I am sure he won't tell.""I may forget everybody
else in the world; but I shall never forget you."A tear moistened his eye, as he uttered his enthusiastic declaration."The worst of it is, John starts at two o'clock--right in the middle
of the night.""So much the better," replied Harry, wiping away the tear."You will take the wagon on the turnpike, where the cart path comes
out."I am sorry to have you go; for I like you, Harry.You will be a very
good boy, when you get to Boston; for they say the city is a wicked
place.""There are a great many temptations there, people say.""I shall try to be as good as you are," replied Harry, who could
imagine nothing better."If I fail once, I shall try again.""Here, Harry, I have brought you a good book--the best of all books.I
have written your name and mine in it; and I hope you will keep it and
read it as long as you live.Harry took the package, and thanked her for it."I never read the Bible much; but I shall read this for your sake.""No, Harry; read it for your own sake.""How I shall long to hear from you!Won't you write me a few lines, now and then, to let me know how
you prosper, and whether you are good or not?"I can't write much; but I suppose I can--"

"Never mind how you write, if I can only read it."The sun had gone down, and the dark shadows of night were gathering
over the forest when they parted, but a short distance from Mr.With the basket which contained provisions for his
journey and the Bible in his hand, he returned to the hut, to get what
sleep he might before the wagon started.CHAPTER XI

IN WHICH HARRY REACHES THE CITY, AND THOUGH OFTEN DISAPPOINTED, TRIES
AGAIN


Harry entered the cabin, and stretched himself on his bed of straw and
leaves; but the fear that he should not wake in season to take the
wagon at the appointed place, would scarcely permit him to close his
eyes.He had not yet made up for the sleep he had lost; and Nature,
not sharing his misgiving, at last closed and sealed his eyelids.It would be presumptuous for me to attempt to inform the reader what
Harry dreamed about on that eventful night; but I can guess that it
was about angels, about bright faces and sweet smiles, and that they
were very pleasant dreams.At any rate, he slept very soundly, as
tired boys are apt to sleep, even when they are anxious about getting
up early in the morning.He woke, at last, with a start; for with his first consciousness came
the remembrance of the early appointment.He sprang from his bed, and
threw down the door of the cabin.It was still dark; the stars
twinkled above, the owls screamed, and the frogs sang merrily around
him.He had no means of ascertaining the time of night.It might be
twelve; it might be four; and his uncertainty on this point filled him
with anxiety.Better too early than too late; and grasping the basket
and the Bible, which were to be the companions of his journey, he
hastened down the cart path to the turnpike.There was no sound of approaching wheels to cheer him, and the clock
in the meeting house at Rockville obstinately refused to strike.He
reached the designated place; there was no wagon there.The thought filled him with chagrin; and he was reading
himself a very severe lesson for having permitted himself to sleep at
all, when the church clock graciously condescended to relieve his
anxiety by striking the hour."One," said he, almost breathless with interest."Two," he repeated, loud enough to be heard, if there had been any one
to hear him."Three"; and he held his breath, waiting for more.he added, with disappointment and chagrin, when it was
certain that the clock did not mean to strike another stroke.Miss Julia will think that I
am a smart fellow, when she finds that her efforts to get me off have
been wasted.I might have known that I should
not wake;" and he stamped his foot upon the ground with impatience.He had been caught napping, and had lost the wagon.He was never so
mortified in his life.One who was so careless did not deserve to
succeed."One thing is clear--it is no use to cry for spilt milk," muttered he,
as he jumped over the fence into the road."I have been stupid, but
try again."Unfortunately, there was no chance to try again.Like thousands of
blessed opportunities, it had passed by, never to return.He had come
at the eleventh hour, and the door was closed against him.With the
wagon it had been "now or never."Harry got over his impatience, and resolved that Julia should not come
to the cabin, the next morning, to find he had slept when the
bridegroom came.He had a pair of legs, and there was the road.It was
no use to "wait for the wagon;" legs were made before wagon wheels;
and he started on the long and weary pilgrimage.He had not advanced ten paces before pleasant sounds reached his ears.A wagon was certainly approaching, and
his heart leaped high with hope.Was it possible that John Lane had
not yet gone?Retracing his steps, he got over the fence at the place
where John was to take him.He had
no right to suppose it was; but he determined to wait till the wagon
had passed.It was a heavy wagon, heavily
loaded, and approached very slowly; but at last it reached the spot
where the impatient boy was waiting.Some lucky accident had detained the
team, and he had regained his opportunity.replied Harry, as he leaped over the fence."You are on hand," added John Lane."I am; but I was sure you had gone.I don't generally get off much before this time," answered
John."Climb up here, and let us be moving on."It was a large wagon, with a sail-cloth cover--one of those regular
baggage wagons which railroads have almost driven out of existence in
Massachusetts.It was drawn by four horses, harnessed two abreast, and
had a high "box" in front for the driver.Harry nimbly climbed upon the box, and took his seat by the side of
John Lane--though that worthy told him he had better crawl under the
cover, where he would find plenty of room to finish his nap on a bale
of goods."I thought likely I should have to go up to the cabin and wake you.Julia told me I must, if you were not on the spot.""I am glad I have saved you that trouble; but Julia said you would
start at two o'clock.""Well, I get off by two or three o'clock.I don't carry the mail, so I
ain't so particular.What do you mean to do when you get to Boston?"John Lane questioned the little wanderer, and drew from him all the
incidents of his past history.He seemed to feel an interest in the
fortunes of his companion, and gave him much good advice on practical
matters, including an insight into life in the city."I suppose Squire Walker would give me fits, if he knew I carried you
off.He was over to Rockville yesterday looking for you.""I hope not, my boy; though I don't know as I should have meddled in
the matter, if Julia hadn't teased me.She is
the best little girl in the world; and you are a lucky fellow to have
such a friend.""I am; she is an angel;" and when Harry began to think of Julia, he
could not think of anything else, and the conversation was suspended.It was a long while before either of them spoke again, and then John
advised Harry to crawl into the wagon and lie down on the load.Notwithstanding his agreeable thoughts, our hero yawned now and then,
and concluded to adopt the suggestion of the driver.He found a very
comfortable bed on the bales, softened by heaps of mattings, which
were to be used in packing the miscellaneous articles of the return
freight.John Lane took things very easily; and as the horses jogged slowly
along, he relieved the monotony of the journey by singing sundry
old-fashioned psalm tunes, which had not then gone out of use.He was
a good singer; and Harry was so pleased with the music, and so
unaccustomed to the heavy jolt of the wagon, that he could not go to
sleep at once."While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
      All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
      And glory shone around."Again and again John's full and sonorous voice rolled out these
familiar lines, till Harry was fairly lulled to sleep by the
harmonious measures.The angel of the Lord had come down for the
fortieth time, after the manner of the ancient psalmody, and for the
fortieth time Harry had thought of _his_ angel, when he dropped off to
dream of the "glory that shone around."Harry slept soundly after he got a little used to the rough motion of
the wagon, and it was sunrise before he woke."Well, Harry, how do you feel now?"asked John, as he emerged from his
lodging apartment."Better; I feel as bright as a new pin.Pretty soon we shall stop to bait
the team and get some breakfast.""I have got some breakfast in my basket.Julia gave me enough to last
a week.I shan't starve, at any rate.""No one would ever be hungry in this world, if everybody were like
Julia.But you shall breakfast with me at the tavern.""It won't be safe--will it?""O, yes; nobody will know you here.""Well, I have got some money to pay for anything I have.""Keep your money, Harry; you will want it all when you get to Boston."After going a few miles farther, they stopped at a tavern, where the
horses were fed, and Harry ate such a breakfast as a pauper never ate
before.John would not let him pay for it, declaring that Julia's
friends were his friends.The remaining portion of the journey was effected without any incident
worthy of narrating, and they reached the city about noon.Of course
the first sight of Boston astonished Harry.His conceptions of a city
were entirely at fault; and though it was not a very large city
twenty-five years ago, it far exceeded his expectations.Harry had a mission before him, and he did not permit his curiosity to
interfere with that.John drove down town to deliver his load; and
Harry went with him, improving every opportunity to obtain work.When
the wagon stopped, he went boldly into the stores in the vicinity to
inquire if they "wanted to hire a hand."Now, Harry was not exactly in a condition to produce a very favorable
impression upon those to whom he applied for work.His clothes were
never very genteel, nor very artistically cut and made; and they were
threadbare, and patched at the knees and elbows.A patch is no
disguise to a man or boy, it is true; but if a little more care had
been taken to adapt the color and kind of fabric in Harry's patches to
the original garment, his general appearance would undoubtedly have
been much improved.Whether these patches really affected his ultimate
success I cannot say--only that they were an inconvenience at the
outset.It was late in the afternoon before John Lane had unloaded his
merchandise and picked up his return freight.Thus far Harry had been
unsuccessful; no one wanted a boy; or if they did, they did not want
such a boy as Harry appeared to be.His country garb, with the five
broad patches, seemed to interfere with the working out of his
manifest destiny.Spruce clerks and
ill-mannered boys laughed at him; but he did not despond."Try again," exclaimed he, as often as he was told that his services
were not required.When the wagon reached Washington Street, Harry wanted to walk, for
the better prosecution of his object; and John gave him directions so
that he could find Major Phillips's stable, where he intended to put
up for the night.Harry trotted along among the gay and genteel people that thronged the
sidewalk; but he was so earnest about his mission, that he could not
stop to look at their fine clothes, nor even at the pictures, the
gewgaws, and gimcracks that tempted him from the windows."'Boy wanted'" Harry read on a paper in the window of a jeweler's
shop."Now's my time;" and, without pausing to consider the chances
that were against him, he entered the store."You want a boy--don't you?"asked he of a young man behind the
counter."We do," replied the person addressed, looking at the applicant with a
broad grin on his face."I should like to hire out," continued Harry, with an earnestness that
would have secured the attention of any man but an idiot.Your name is Joseph--isn't it?""No, sir; my name is Harry West."The Book says he had a coat of many
colors, though I believe it don't say anything about the trousers,"
sneered the shopkeeper.If you want to hire a boy, I
will do the best I can for you," replied Harry, willing to appreciate
the joke of the other, if he could get a place."You won't answer for us; you come from the country.""You had better go back, and let yourself to some farmer.You will
make a good scarecrow to hang up in the field.No crow would ever come
near you, I'll warrant."Harry's blood boiled with indignation at this gratuitous insult.His
cheeks reddened, and he looked about him for the means of inflicting
summary vengeance upon the poltroon who so wantonly trifled with his
glowing aspirations."Move on, boy; we don't want you," added the man."You are a ----"

I will not write what Harry said.It was a vulgar epithet, coupled
with a monstrous oath for so small a boy to utter.The shopkeeper
sprang out from his counter; but Harry retreated, and escaped him,
though not till he had repeated the vulgar and profane expression.But he was sorry for what he had said before he had gone ten paces."What would the little angel say, if she had heard that?""'Twon't do; I must try again."CHAPTER XII

IN WHICH HARRY SUDDENLY GETS RICH AND HAS A CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER
HARRY


By the time he reached the stable, Harry would have given almost
anything to have recalled the hasty expressions he had used.He had
acquired the low and vulgar habit of using profane language at the
poorhouse.He was conscious that it was not only wicked to do so, but
that it was very offensive to many persons who did not make much
pretension to piety, or even morality; and, in summing up his faults
in the woods, he had included this habit as one of the worst.She hoped he was a good boy--Julia Bryant, the little angel, hoped so.Her blood would have frozen in her veins if she had listened to the
irreverent words he had uttered in the shop.He had broken his
resolution, broken his promise to the little angel, on the first day
he had been in the city.It was a bad beginning; but instead of
permitting this first failure to do right to discourage him, he
determined to persevere--to try again.A good life, a lofty character, with all the trials and sacrifices
which it demands, is worth working for; and those who mean to grow
better than they are will often be obliged to "try again."The spirit
may be willing to do well, but the flesh is weak, and we are all
exposed to temptation.We may make our good resolutions--and it is
very easy to make them, but when we fail to keep them--it is sometimes
very hard to keep them--we must not be discouraged, but do as Harry
did--TRY AGAIN."Well, Harry, how did you make out?"asked John Lane, when Harry
joined him at the stable."O, well, you will find a place."I don't know what I shall do with you to-night.Every bed in the
tavern up the street, where I stop, is full.I have slept in worse places
than that.""I will fix a place for you, then."After they had prepared his bed, Harry drew out his basket, and
proceeded to eat his supper.He then took a walk down Washington
Street, with John, went to an auction, and otherwise amused himself
till after nine o'clock, when he returned to the stable.After John had left him, as he was walking towards the wagon, with the
intention of retiring for the night, his foot struck against something
which attracted his attention.He kicked it once or twice, to
determine what it was, and then picked it up.he exclaimed; "it is a pocketbook.My fortune is made;"
and without stopping to consider the matter any further, he scrambled
into the wagon.His heart jumped with excitement, for his vivid imagination had
already led him to the conclusion that it was stuffed full of money.It might contain a hundred dollars, perhaps five hundred; and these
sums were about as far as his ideas could reach.He could buy a suit of new clothes, a new cap, new shoes, and be as
spruce as any of the boys he had seen about the city.Then he could go
to a boarding house, and live like a prince, till he could get a place
that suited him; for Harry, however rich he might be, did not think of
living without labor of some kind.He could dress himself up in fine
broadcloth, present himself at the jeweler's shop where they wanted a
boy, and then see whether he would make a good scarecrow.Then his thoughts reverted to the cabin, where he had slept two
nights, and, of course, to the little angel, who had supplied the
commissary department during his sojourn in the woods.He could dress
himself up with the money in the pocketbook, and, after a while, when
he got a place, take the stage for Rockville.Wouldn't she be
astonished to see him then, in fine broadcloth!Wouldn't she walk with
him over to the spot where he had killed the black snake!Wouldn't she
be proud to tell her father that this was the boy she had fed in the
woods!He had promised to write to her when he got
settled, and tell her how he got along, and whether he was good or
not.How glad she would be to hear that he was
getting along so finely!I am sorry to say it, but Harry really felt sad when the thought
occurred to him.He had been building very pretty air castles on this
money, and this reflection suddenly tumbled them all down--new
clothes, new cap, boarding house, visit to Rockville--all in a heap."But I found it," Harry reasoned with himself.Something within him spoke out, saying:

"You stole it, Harry.""No, I didn't; I found it.""If you don't return it to the owner, you will be a thief," continued
the voice within.I dare say the owner does not want
it half so much as I do.""No matter for that, Harry; if you keep it you will be a thief."It was the real Harry,
within the other Harry, that spoke, and he was a very obstinate
fellow, positively refusing to let him keep the pocketbook, at any
rate.She hoped I would be a good boy, and the evil one is
catching me as fast as he can," resumed Harry."Be a good boy," added the other Harry."I mean to be, if I can.""The little angel will be very sad when she finds out that you are a
thief.""I don't mean to be a thief."If she does not, there is One above who will know, and his angels
will frown upon you, and stamp your crime upon your face.Then you
will go about like Cain, with a mark upon you."said the outer Harry, who was sorely tempted by the treasure
within his grasp."You will not dare to look the little angel in the face, if you steal
this money.She will know you are not good, then.Honest folks always
hold their heads up, and are never ashamed to face any person.""Why did I
think of such a thing?"He felt strong then, for the Spirit had triumphed over the Flesh.The
foe within had been beaten back, at least for the moment; and as he
laid his head upon the old coat that was to serve him for a pillow, he
thought of Julia Bryant.He thought he saw her sweet face, and there
was an angelic smile upon it.My young readers will remember, after Jesus had been tempted, and
said, "Get thee behind, Satan," that "behold, angels came and
ministered unto him."They came and ministered to Harry after he had
cast out the evil thought; they come and minister to all who resist
temptation.They come in the heart, and minister with the healing balm
of an approving conscience.Placing the pocketbook under his head, with the intention of finding
the owner in the morning, he went to sleep.The fatigue and excitement
of the day softened his pillow, and not once did he open his eyes till
the toils of another day had commenced around him.I question whether
he would have slept so soundly if he had decided to keep the
pocketbook.He had only been conquered for the
moment--subdued only to attack him again.The first thought of the
treasure, in the morning, was to covet it.Again he allowed his fancy
to picture the comforts and the luxuries which it would purchase."No one will know it," he added."God will know it; you will know it yourself," said the other Harry,
more faithful and conscientious than the outside Harry, who, it must
be confessed, was sometimes disposed to be the "Old Harry.""_She_ hoped you would be a good boy," added the monitor within."I will--that is, when I can afford it.""Be good now, or you never will."But the little angel--the act would forever
banish him from her presence.He would never dare to look at her
again, or even to write the letter he had promised."I will," exclaimed Harry, in an earnest whisper; and again the
tempter was cast out.Once more the fine air castles began to pile themselves up before
him, standing on the coveted treasure; but he resolutely pitched them
down, and banished them from his mind.I didn't miss it till this morning; and I have been to
every place where I was last night; so I think I must have lost it
here, when I put my horse up," replied another.The first speaker was one of the ostlers; and the moment Harry heard
the other voice he started as though a rattlesnake had rattled in his
path.As the speaker proceeded, he was satisfied
beyond the possibility of a doubt that the voice belonged to Squire
Walker."About a hundred and fifty dollars; and there were notes and other
papers of great value," replied Squire Walker."Well, I haven't seen or heard anything about it.""I remember taking it out of my great-coat pocket, and putting it into
a pocket inside of my vest, when I got out of the wagon.""I don't think you lost it here.Some of us would have found it, if
you had."He had determined to restore the
pocketbook; but he could not do so without exposing himself.Besides,
if there had been any temptation to keep the treasure before, it was
ten times as great now that he knew it belonged to his enemy.It would
be no sin to keep it from Squire Walker."It would be stealing," said the voice within."But if I give it to him, he will carry me back to Jacob Wire's.I'll
be--I'll be hanged if I do.""She hopes you will be a good boy."There was no resisting this appeal; and again the demon was put down,
and the triumph added another laurel to the moral crown of the little
hero."It will be a dear journey to me," continued Squire Walker."I was
looking all day yesterday after a boy that ran away from the
poorhouse, and came to the city for him.I brought that money down to put in the bank.Harry waited no longer; but while his heart beat like the machinery in
the great factory at Rockville, he tumbled out of his nest, and slid
down the bale of goods to the pavement.exclaimed Squire
Walker, springing forward to catch him.Harry dodged, and kept out of his reach.shouted the squire to the ostler."Wait a minute, Squire Walker," said Harry."I won't go back to Jacob
Wire's, anyhow.Just hear what I have got to say; and then, if you
want to take me, you may, if you can."It was evident, even to the squire, that Harry had something of
importance to say; and he involuntarily paused to hear it."I have found your pocketbook, squire, and--"

"Give it to me, and I won't touch you," cried the overseer, eagerly.It was clear that the loss of his pocketbook had produced a salutary
impression on the squire's mind.He loved money, and the punishment
was more than he could bear."I was walking along here, last night, when I struck my foot against
something.I picked it up, and found it was a pocketbook.Here it is;" and Harry handed him his lost treasure.exclaimed he, after he had assured himself that the
contents of the pocketbook had not been disturbed."That is more than
ever I expected of you, Master Harry West.""I mean to be honest," replied Harry, proudly.I told you, Harry, I wouldn't touch you; and I
won't," continued the squire.He had come to Boston with the intention of
catching Harry, cost what it might,--he meant to charge the expense to
the town; but the recovery of his money had warmed his heart, and
banished the malice he cherished toward the boy.Squire Walker volunteered some excellent advice for the guidance of
the little pilgrim, who, he facetiously observed, had now no one to
look after his manners and morals--manners first, and morals
afterwards.He must be very careful and prudent, and he wished him
well.Harry, however, took this wholesome counsel as from whom it
came, and was not very deeply impressed by it.John Lane came to the stable soon after, and congratulated our hero
upon the termination of the persecution from Redfield, and, when his
horses were hitched on, bade him good bye, with many hearty wishes for
his future success.CHAPTER XIII

IN WHICH HARRY BECOMES A STABLE BOY, AND HEARS BAD NEWS FROM ROCKVILLE


Harry was exceedingly rejoiced at the remarkable turn his affairs had
taken.It is true, he had lost the treasure upon which his fancy had
built so many fine castles; but he did not regret the loss, since it
had purchased his exemption from the Redfield persecution.He had
conquered his enemy--which was a great victory--by being honest and
upright; and he had conquered himself--which was a greater victory--by
listening to the voice within him.He resisted temptation, and the
victory made him strong.Our hero had won a triumph, but the battlefield was still spread out
before him.There were thousands of enemies lurking in his path, ready
to fall upon and despoil him of his priceless treasure--his integrity."She had hoped he would be a good boy."He had done his duty--he had
been true in the face of temptation.He wanted to write to Julia then,
and tell her of his triumph--that, when tempted, he had thought of
her, and won the victory.The world was before him; it had no place for idlers, and he must get
work.The contents of the basket were not yet exhausted, and he took
it to a retired corner to eat his breakfast.While he was thus
engaged, Joe Flint, the ostler, happened to see him."Why don't you go to the tavern and
have your breakfast like a gentleman?""I can't afford it," replied Harry.How much did the man that owned the pocketbook give
you?"I'm blamed if he ain't a mean one!"I was too glad to get clear of him to think
of anything else.""Next time he loses his pocketbook, I hope he won't find it."And with this charitable observation, Joe resumed his labors.Harry
finished his meal, washed it down with a draught of cold water at the
pump, and was ready for business again.Unfortunately, there was no
business ready for him.All day long he wandered about the streets in
search of employment; but people did not appreciate his value.No one
would hire him or have anything to do with him.The five patches on
his clothes, he soon discovered, rendered it useless for him to apply
at the stores.He was not in a condition to be tolerated about one of
these; and he turned his attention to the market, the stables, and the
teaming establishments, yet with no better success.It was in vain
that he tried again; and at night, weary and dispirited, he returned
to Major Phillips's stable.His commissariat was not yet exhausted; and he made a hearty supper
from the basket.It became an interesting question for him to
consider how he should pass the night.He could not afford to pay one
of his quarters for a night's lodging at the tavern opposite.There
was the stable, however, if he could get permission to sleep there."May I sleep in the hay loft, Joe?"he asked, as the ostler passed
him."Major Phillips don't allow any one to sleep in the hay loft; but
perhaps he will let you sleep there.said Harry, not a little
surprised to find his fame had gone before him."He heard about the pocketbook, and wanted to see you.He said it was
the meanest thing he ever heard of, that the man who lost it didn't
give you anything; and them's my sentiments exactly.Here comes the
major; I will speak to him about you.""Major Phillips, this boy wants to know if he may sleep in the hay
loft to-night.""No," replied the stable keeper, short as pie crust."This is the boy that found the pocketbook, and he hain't got no place
to sleep."Then I will find a place for him to sleep.So, my boy, you
are an honest fellow.""I try to be," replied Harry, modestly."If you had kept the pocketbook you might have lodged at the Tremont
House.""I had rather sleep in your stable, without it.""Squire Walker was mean not to give you a ten-dollar bill.What are
you going to do with yourself?""I want to get work; perhaps you have got something for me to do."Well, I don't know as I have."Major Phillips was a great fat man, rough, vulgar, and profane in his
conversation; but he had a kind of sympathizing nature.Though he
swore like a pirate sometimes, his heart was in the right place, so
far as humanity was concerned.He took Harry into the counting room of the stable, and questioned him
in regard to his past history and future prospects.The latter,
however, were just now rather clouded.He told the major his
experience in trying to get something to do, and was afraid he should
not find a place.The stable keeper was interested in him and in his story.He swore
roundly at the meanness of Jacob Wire and Squire Walker, and commended
him for running away."Well, my lad, I don't know as I can do much for you.I have three
ostlers now, which is quite enough, and all I can afford to pay; but I
suppose I can find enough for a boy to do about the house and the
stable."You can't earn much for me just now; but if you are a-mind to try it,
I will give you six dollars a month and your board.""Thank you, sir; I shall be very glad of the chance.""Very well; but if you work for me, you must get up early in the
morning, and be wide awake.""Now, we will see about a place for you to sleep."Over the counting room was an apartment in which two of the ostlers
slept.There was room for another bed, and one was immediately set up
for Harry's use.Once more, then, our hero was at home, if a mere abiding place
deserves that hallowed name.It was not an elegant, or even a
commodious, apartment in which Harry was to sleep.The walls were
dingy and black; the beds looked as though they had never been clean;
and there was a greasy smell which came from several harnesses that
were kept there.It was comfortable, if not poetical; and Harry soon
felt perfectly at home.His first duty was to cultivate the acquaintance of the ostlers.He
found them to be rough, good-natured men, not over-scrupulous about
their manners or their morals.If it does not occur to my young
readers, it will to their parents, that this was not a fit place for
a boy--that he was in constant contact with corruption.His companions
were good-hearted men; but this circumstance rendered them all the
more dangerous.There was no fireside of home, at which the evil
effects of communication with men of loose morals would be
counteracted.Harry had not been an hour in their society before he
caught himself using a big oath--which, when he had gone to bed, he
heartily repented, renewing his resolution with the promise to try
again.He was up bright and early the next morning, made a fire in the
counting room, and had let out half the horses in the stable to water,
before Major Phillips came out.His services were in demand, as Joe
Flint, for some reason, had not come to the stable that morning.The stable keeper declared that he had gone on a "spree," and told
Harry he might take his place.Harry did take his place; and the ostlers declared that, in everything
but cleaning the horses, he made good his place.The knowledge and
skill which he had obtained at the poorhouse was of great value to
him; and, at night, though he was very tired, he was satisfied that he
had done a good day's work.The ostlers took their meals at the house of Major Phillips, which
stood at one side of the stable yard.Phillips
very well; she was cross, and the men said she was a "regular Tartar."He afterwards found it a
difficult matter; for he had to bring wood and water, and do other
chores about the house, and he soon ascertained that she was
determined not to be pleased with anything he did.He tried to keep
his temper, however, and meekly submitted to all her scolding and
grumbling.Thus far, while Harry has been passing through the momentous period of
his life with which we commenced his story, we have minutely detailed
the incidents of his daily life, so that we have related the events of
only a few days.He has got a place, and
of course one day is very much like every other.The reader knows him
now--knows what kind of boy he is, and what his hopes and expectations
are.The reader knows, too, the great moral epoch in his history--the
event which roused his consciousness of error, and stimulated him to
become better; that he has a talisman in his mind, which can be no
better expressed than by those words he so often repeated, "She hoped
he would be a good boy."And her angel smile went with him to
encourage him in the midst of trial and temptation--to give him the
victory over the foes that assailed him.We shall henceforth give results, instead of a daily record, stopping
to detail only the great events of his career.We shall pass over three months, during which time he worked
diligently and faithfully for Major Phillips.Every day had its trials
and temptations; not a day passed in which there were none.The habit
of using profane language he found it very hard to eradicate; but he
persevered; and though he often sinned, he as often repented and tried
again, until he had fairly mastered the enemy.It was a great triumph,
especially when it is remembered that he was surrounded by those whose
every tenth word at least was an oath.He was tempted to lie, tempted to neglect his work, tempted to steal,
tempted in a score of other things.And often he yielded; but the
remembrance of the little angel, and the words of the good Book she
had given him, cheered and supported him as he struggled on.Harry's finances were in a tolerably prosperous condition.With his
earnings he had bought a suit of clothes, and went to church half a
day every Sunday.Besides his wages, he had saved about five dollars
from the "perquisites" which he received from customers for holding
their horses, running errands, and other little services a boy could
perform.He was very careful and prudent with his money; and whenever
he added anything to his little hoard, he thought of the man who had
become rich by saving up his fourpences.He still cherished his
purpose to become a rich man, and it is very likely he had some
brilliant anticipations of success.Not a cent did he spend foolishly,
though it was hard work to resist the inclination to buy the fine
things that tempted him from the shop windows.Those who knew him best regarded him as a very strange boy; but that
was only because he was a little out of his element.He would have
preferred to be among men who did not bluster and swear; but, in spite
of them, he had the courage and the fortitude to be true to himself.The little angel still maintained her ascendency in his moral nature.The ostlers laughed at him when he took out his little Bible, before
he went to bed, to drink of the waters of life.They railed at him,
called him "Little Pious," and tried to induce him to pitch cents, in
the back yard, on Sunday afternoon, instead of going to church.He
generally bore these taunts with patience, though sometimes his high
spirit would get the better of his desire to be what the little angel
wished him to be.John Lane put up at the stable once a week; and, every time he
returned to Rockville, he carried a written or a verbal account of the
prosperity of the little pauper boy.One Sunday, he wrote her a long
letter all about "being good"--how he was tempted, and how he
struggled for her sake and for the sake of the truth.In return, he often received messages and letters from her, breathing
the same pure spirit which she had manifested when she "fed him in the
wilderness."These communications strengthened his moral nature, and
enabled him to resist temptation.He felt just as though she was an
angel sent into the world to watch over him.Perhaps he had fallen
without them; at any rate, her influence was very powerful.About the middle of January, when the earth was covered with snow, and
the bleak, cold winds of winter blew over the city, John Lane informed
Harry, on his arrival, that Julia was very sick with the scarlet fever
and canker rash, and it was feared she would not recover.He wept when he thought of her
sweet face reddened with the flush of fever; and he fled to his
chamber, to vent his emotions in silence and solitude.CHAPTER XIV

IN WHICH HARRY DOES A GOOD DEED, AND DETERMINES TO "FACE THE MUSIC"


While Harry sat by the stove in the ostlers' room, grieving at the
intelligence he had received from Rockville, a little girl, so lame
that she walked with a crutch, hobbled into the apartment.she asked, in tones so sad that Harry could not
help knowing she was in distress."I don't know as I am acquainted with your father," replied Harry."He is one of the ostlers here.""Yes; he has not been home to dinner or supper to-day, and mother is
very sick.""I haven't seen him to-day."sighed the little girl, as she
hobbled away.Harry was struck by the sad appearance of the girl, and the desponding
words she uttered.Of late, Joe Flint's vile habit of intemperance had
grown upon him so rapidly that he did not work at the stable more than
one day in three.For two months, Major Phillips had been threatening
to discharge him; and nothing but kindly consideration for his family
had prevented him from doing so.asked Harry of one of the ostlers, who
came into the room soon after the departure of the little girl."No, and don't want to see him," replied Abner, testily; for, in Joe's
absence, his work had to be done by the other ostlers, who did not
feel very kindly towards him."His little girl has just been here after him.""Very likely he hasn't been home for a week," added Abner."I should
think his family would be very thankful if they never saw him again.He is a nuisance to himself and everybody else.""Just up in Avery Street--in a ten-footer there.""The little girl said her mother was very sick."She is always sick; and I don't much wonder.Joe Flint is
enough to make any one sick.He has been drunk about two-thirds of the
time for two months.""I don't see how his family get along."After Abner had warmed himself, he left the room.Harry was haunted by
the sad look and desponding tones of the poor lame girl.It was a
bitter cold evening; and what if Joe's family were suffering with the
cold and hunger!It was sad to think of such a thing; and Harry was
deeply moved."She hoped I would be a good boy.She is very sick now, and perhaps
she will die," said Harry to himself."What would she do, if she were
here now?"He knew very well what she would do, and he determined to do it
himself.His heart was so deeply moved by the picture of sorrow and
suffering with which his imagination had invested the home of the
intemperate ostler that it required no argument to induce him to go.However sweet and consoling
may be the sympathy of others to those in distress, it will not warm
the chilled limbs or feed the hungry mouths; and Harry thanked God
then that he had not spent his money foolishly upon gewgaws and
gimcracks, or in gratifying a selfish appetite.After assuring himself that no one was approaching, he jumped on his
bedstead, and reaching up into a hole in the board ceiling of the
room, he took out a large wooden pill box, which was nearly filled
with various silver coins, from a five-cent piece to a half dollar.Putting the box in his pocket, he went down to the stable, and
inquired more particularly in relation Joe's house.When he had received such directions as would enable him to find the
place, he told Abner he wanted to be absent a little while, and left
the stable.He had no difficulty in finding the home of the drunkard's
family.It was a little, old wooden house, in Avery Street, opposite
Haymarket Place, which has long since been pulled down to make room
for a more elegant dwelling.Harry knocked, and was admitted by the little lame girl whom he had
seen at the stable."I have come to see if I can do anything for you," said Harry, as he
moved forward into the room in which the family lived."I haven't; Abner says he hasn't been to the stable to-day.asked Harry, as he entered the dark room."We haven't got any oil, nor any candles."In the fireplace, a piece of pine board was blazing, which cast a
faint and fitful glare into the room; and Harry was thus enabled to
behold the scene which the miserable home of the drunkard presented.In one corner was a dilapidated bedstead, on which lay the sick woman.Drawn from under it was a trundle bed, upon which lay two small
children, who had evidently been put to bed at that early hour to keep
them warm, for the temperature of the apartment was scarcely more
comfortable than that of the open air.It was a cheerless home; and
the faint light of the blazing board only served to increase the
desolate appearance of the place."The boy that works at the stable," replied the lame girl."My name is Harry West, marm; and I come to see if you wanted
anything," added Harry."We want a great many things," sighed she."Can you tell me where my
husband is?""I can't; he hasn't been at the stable to-day."and I will do
everything I can for you."When her mother sobbed, the lame girl sat down on the bed and cried
bitterly.Harry's tender heart was melted; and he would have wept also
if he had not been conscious of the high mission he had to perform;
and he felt very grateful that he was able to dry up those tears and
carry gladness to those bleeding hearts."I don't know what you can do for us," said the poor woman, "though I
am sure I am very much obliged to you.""I can do a great deal, marm.Cheer up," replied Harry, tenderly.As he spoke, one of the children in the trundle bed sobbed in its
sleep; and the poor mother's heart seemed to be lacerated by the
sound."He had no supper but a crust of bread and a
cup of cold water.He cried himself to sleep with cold and hunger."And the room is very cold," added Harry, glancing around him.Our wood is all gone but two great logs."I worked for an hour trying to split some pieces off them," said
Katy, the lame girl."I will fix them, marm," replied Harry, who felt the strength of ten
stout men in his limbs at that moment.Katy brought him a peck basket, and Harry rushed out of the house as
though he had been shot.Great deeds were before him, and he was
inspired for the occasion.Placing it in a chair, he took from it a package of candles, one of
which he lighted and placed in a tin candlestick on the table."Now we have got a little light on the subject," said he, as he began
to display the contents of the basket."Here, Katy, is two pounds of
meat; here is half a pound of tea; you had better put a little in the
teapot, and let it be steeping for your mother.""You are an angel sent from
Heaven to help us in our distress.""No, marm; I ain't an angel," answered Harry, who seemed to feel that
Julia Bryant had an exclusive monopoly of that appellation, so far as
it could be reasonably applied to mortals."I only want to do my duty,
marm."Katy Flint was so bewildered that she could say nothing, though her
opinion undoubtedly coincided with that of her mother."Here is two loaves of bread and two dozen crackers; a pound of
butter; two pounds of sugar.I will go down to Thomas's in two shakes of
a jiffy."Flint protested that she did not want any milk--that she could
get along very well without it; but Harry said the children must have
it; and, without waiting for Katy to get the pitcher, he took it from
the closet, and ran out of the house.When he returned he found Katy trying
to make the teakettle boil, but with very poor success."Now, Katy, show me the logs, and I will soon have a fire."The lame girl conducted him to the cellar, where Harry found the
remnants of the old box which Katy had tried to split.Seizing the
axe, he struck a few vigorous blows, and the pine boards were reduced
to a proper shape for use.Taking an armful, he returned to the
chamber; and soon a good fire was blazing under the teakettle."There, marm, we will soon have things to rights," said Harry, as he
rose from the hearth, where he had stooped down to blow the fire."I am sure we should have perished if you had not come," added Mrs.Flint, who was not disposed to undervalue Harry's good deeds."I hope we shall be able to pay you back all the money you have spent;
but I don't know.Joseph has got so bad, I don't know what he is
coming to.He always uses me well, even when
he is in liquor.Nothing but drink could make him neglect us so.""It is a hard case, marm," added Harry."Very hard; he hasn't done much of anything for us this winter.I have
been out to work every day till a fortnight ago, when I got sick and
couldn't do anything.Katy has kept us alive since then; she is a good
girl, and takes the whole care of Tommy and Susan.""I don't mind that, if I only had things to do with," said Katy, who
was busy disposing of the provisions which Harry had bought.As soon as the kettle boiled, she made tea, and prepared a little
toast for her mother, who, however, was too sick to take much
nourishment."Now, Katy, you must eat yourself," interposed Harry, when all was
ready."I can't eat," replied the poor girl, bursting into tears.Just then the children in the trundle bed, disturbed by the unusual
bustle in the room, waked, and gazed with wonder at Harry, who had
seated himself on the bed.exclaimed Katy; "she has waked up.They were taken up; and Harry's eyes were gladdened by such a sight as
he had never beheld before.The hungry ate; and every mouthful they
took swelled the heart of the little almoner of God's bounty.If the
thought of Julia Bryant, languishing on a bed of sickness, had not
marred his satisfaction, he had been perfectly happy.But he was
doing a deed that would rejoice her heart; he was doing just what she
had done for him; he was doing just what she would have done, if she
had been there."She hoped he would be a good boy."His conscience told him he had
been a good boy--that he had been true to himself, and true to the
noble example she had set before him.While the family were still at supper, Harry, lighting another candle,
went down cellar to pay his respects to those big logs.He was a stout
boy, and accustomed to the use of the axe.By slow degrees he chipped
off the logs, until they were used up, and a great pile of serviceable
wood was before him.Not content with this, he carried up several
large armfuls of it, which he deposited by the fireplace in the room."Now, marm, I don't know as I can do anything more for you to-night,"
said he, moving towards the door."The Lord knows you have done enough," replied the poor woman."I hope
we shall be able to pay you for what you have done.""I don't want anything, marm.""If we can't pay you, the Lord will reward you."I hope you will get better, marm."I feel better to-night than I have felt before for a
week."asked Abner, when he entered the
ostler's room.The old man wanted you; and when he couldn't find you,
he was mad as thunder."said Harry, somewhat annoyed to find that, while he had
been doing his duty in one direction, he had neglected his duty in
another.Whatever he should catch, he determined to "face the music," and left
the room to find his employer.CHAPTER XV

IN WHICH HARRY MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE


Major Phillips was in the counting room, where Harry, dreading his
anger, presented himself before him.He usually acted first, and thought the matter over afterwards; so
that he frequently had occasion to undo what had been done in haste
and passion.His heart was kind, but his temper generally had the
first word."So you have come, Harry," exclaimed he, as our hero opened the door."I have been out a little while," replied Harry, whose modesty
rebelled at the idea of proclaiming the good deed he had done.roared the major, with an oath that froze the
boy's blood.You know I don't allow man
or boy to leave the stable without letting me know it.""I was wrong, sir; but I--"

"You little snivelling monkey, how dared you leave the stable?"continued the stable keeper, heedless of the boy's submission."I'll
teach you better than that."said Harry, suddenly changing his tone, as his blood began
to boil."You can begin as quick as you like."I have a great mind to give you a cowhiding,"
thundered the enraged stable keeper."I should like to see you do it," replied Harry, fixing his eyes on
the poker that lay on the floor near the stove."Should you, you impertinent puppy?"The major sprang forward, as if to grasp the boy by the collar; but
Harry, with his eyes still fixed on the poker, retreated a pace or
two, ready to act promptly when the decisive moment should come.Forgetting for the time that he had run away from one duty to attend
to another, he felt indignant that he should be thus rudely treated
for being absent a short time on an errand of love and charity.He
gave himself too much credit for the good deed, and felt that he was a
martyr to his philanthropic spirit.He was willing to bear all and
brave all in a good cause; and it seemed to him, just then, as though
he was being punished for assisting Joe Flint's family, instead of for
leaving his place without permission.A great many persons who mean
well are apt to think themselves martyrs for any good cause in which
they may be engaged, when, in reality, their own want of tact, or the
offensive manner in which they present their truth, is the stake at
which they are burned.The major was so angry that he could do nothing; and while they were
thus confronting each other, Joe Flint staggered into the counting
room.Intoxicated as he was, he readily discovered the position of
affairs between the belligerents."Look here--hic--Major Phillips," said he, reeling up to his employer,
"I love you--hic--Major Phillips, like a--hic--like a brother, Major
Phillips; but if you touch that boy, Major Phillips, I'll--hic--you
touch me, Major Phillips."Go home, Joe," replied the stable keeper, his attention diverted from
Harry to the new combatant."I know I'm drunk, Major Phillips.I'm as drunk as a beast; but I
ain't--hic--dead drunk.I'm a brute; I'm a hog; I'm a--dzwhat you call it?Joe tried to straighten himself up, and look at his employer; but he
could not, and suddenly bursting into tears, he threw himself heavily
into a chair, weeping bitterly in his inebriate paroxysm.He sobbed,
and groaned, and talked incoherently.He acted strangely, and Major
Phillips's attention was excited.he asked; and his anger towards Harry
seemed to have subsided."I tell you I am a villain, Major Phillips," blubbered Joe."Haven't I been on a drunk, and left my family to starve and freeze?"groaned Joe, interlarding his speech with violent ebullitions of
weeping."Wouldn't my poor wife, and my poor children--O my God," and
the poor drunkard covered his face with his hands, and sobbed like an
infant.asked Major Phillips, who
had never seen him in this frame before."Wouldn't they all have died if Harry hadn't gone and fed 'em, and
split up wood to warm 'em?"As he spoke, Joe sprang up, and rushed towards Harry, and in his
drunken frenzy attempted to embrace him.said the stable keeper, turning to our
hero, who, while Joe was telling his story, had been thinking of
something else."What a fool I was to get mad!""What would she say if she
had seen me just now?"My folks would have died if it hadn't been for him," hiccoughed Joe."Explain it, Harry," added the major."The lame girl, Katy, came down here after her father early in the
evening.She seemed to be in trouble and I thought I would go up and
see what the matter was.I found them in rather a bad condition,
without any wood or anything to eat.I did what I could for them, and
came away," replied Harry.and the major grasped his hand like a
vise."You are a good fellow," he added, with an oath.Phillips, for saying what I did; I was mad," pleaded
Harry."So was I, my boy; but we won't mind that.You are a good fellow, and
I like your spunk.So you have really been taking care of Joe's family
while he was off on a drunk?""Look here, Harry, and you, Major Phillips.When I get this rum out of
me I'll never take another drop again," said Joe, throwing himself
into a chair.You have said that twenty times before," added Major
Phillips.exclaimed Joe, doubling his fist, and bringing it down
with the intention of hitting the table by his side to emphasize his
resolution; but, unfortunately, he missed the table--a circumstance
which seemed to fore-shadow the fate of his resolve.Joe proceeded to declare in his broken speech what a shock he had
received when he went home, half an hour before--the first time for
several days--and heard the reproaches of his suffering wife; how
grateful he was to Harry, and what a villain he considered himself.Either the sufferings of his family, or the rum he had drunk, melted
his heart, and he was as eloquent as his half-paralyzed tongue would
permit.He was a pitiable object; and having assured himself that
Joe's family were comfortable for the night, Major Phillips put him to
bed in his own house.Harry was not satisfied with himself; he had permitted his temper to
get the better of him.He thought of Julia on her bed of suffering,
wept for her, and repented for himself.That night he heard the clock
on the Boylston market strike twelve before he closed his eyes to
sleep.The next day, while he was at work in the stable, a boy of about
fifteen called to see him, and desired to speak with him alone.Harry,
much wondering who his visitor was, and what he wanted, conducted him
to the ostlers' chamber."That is my name, for the want of a better," replied Harry."Then there is a little matter to be settled between you and me.You
helped my folks out last night, and I want to pay you for it.""I am," replied Edward, who did not seem to feel much honored by the
relationship."Your folks were in a bad condition last night.""But I didn't know Joe had a son as old as you are.""I am the oldest; but I don't live at home, and have not for three
years.How much did you pay out for them last night?"Edward Flint manifested some uneasiness at the announcement.He had
evidently come with a purpose, but had found things different from
what he had expected."I didn't think it was so much.""The fact is, I have only three dollars just now; and I promised to go
out to ride with a fellow next Sunday.So, you see, if I pay you, I
shall not have enough left to foot the bills."Harry looked at his visitor with astonishment; he did not know what to
make of him.Would a son of Joseph Flint go out to
ride--on Sunday, too--while his mother and his brothers and sisters
were on the very brink of starvation?Our hero had some strange,
old-fashioned notions of his own.For instance, he considered it a
son's duty to take care of his mother, even if he were obliged to
forego the Sunday ride; that he ought to do all he could for his
brothers and sisters, even if he had to go without stewed oysters,
stay away from the theatre, and perhaps wear a little coarser cloth on
his back.If Harry was unreasonable in his views, my young reader will
remember that he was brought up in the country, where young America is
not quite so "fast" as in the city."I didn't ask you to pay me," continued Harry."I know that; but, you see, I suppose I ought to pay you.The old man
don't take much care of the family."Harry wanted to say that the young man did not appear to do much
better; but he was disposed to be as civil as the circumstances would
permit."Oh, yes, I shall pay you; but if you can wait till the first of next
month, I should like it."I am a clerk in a store
downtown," replied Edward, with offended dignity."Pretty fair; I get five dollars a week."I should think you did get paid pretty
well!"exclaimed Harry, astonished at the vastness of the sum for a
week's work."Fair salary," added Edward, complacently."I work in the stable and about the house.""Six dollars a month and perquisites.""It is as well as I can do.""No, it isn't; why don't you go into a store?"We pay from two to four dollars a week."asked Harry, now much interested in his
companion."Make the fires, sweep out in the morning, go on errands, and such
work.Boys must begin at the foot of the ladder.I began at the foot
of the ladder," answered Mr.Flint, with an immense self-sufficiency,
which Harry, however, failed to notice."I should like to get into a store.""You will have a good chance to rise.""I am willing to do anything, so that I can have a chance to get
ahead."As it was, he was left to
infer that Mr.Flint was a partner in the concern, unless the five
dollars per week was an argument to the contrary; but he didn't like
to ask strange questions, and desired to know whom "he worked for."Edward Flint did not "work for" anybody.He was a clerk in the
extensive dry goods establishment of the Messrs.Wake & Wade, which,
he declared, was the largest concern in Boston; and one might further
have concluded that Mr.Flint was the most important personage in the
said concern.Flint was obliged to descend from his lofty dignity, and compound
the dollar and twenty cents with the stable boy by promising to get
him the vacant place in the establishment of Wake & Wade, if his
influence was sufficient to procure it.Harry was satisfied, and
begged him not to distress himself about the debt.The visitor took
his leave, promising to see him again the next day.About noon Joe Flint appeared at the stable again, perfectly sober.Major Phillips had lent him ten dollars, in anticipation of his
month's wages, and he had been home to attend to the comfort of his
suffering family.After dinner he had a long talk with Harry, in
which, after paying him the money disbursed on the previous evening,
he repeated his solemn resolution to drink no more.He was very
grateful to Harry, and hoped he should be able to do as much for him."Don't drink any more, Joe, and it will be the best day's work I ever
did," added Harry.CHAPTER XVI

IN WHICH HARRY GOES INTO THE DRYGOODS BUSINESS


Mr.Edward Flint's reputation as a gentleman of honor and a man of his
word suffered somewhat in Harry's estimation; for he waited all day,
and all evening, without hearing a word from the firm of Wake & Wade.He had actually begun to doubt whether the accomplished young man had
as much influence with the firm as he had led him to suppose.But his
ambition would not permit him longer to be satisfied with the humble
sphere of a stable boy; and he determined, if he did not hear from
Edward, to apply for the situation himself.The next day, having procured two hours' leave of absence from the
stable, he called at the home of Joe Flint to obtain further
particulars concerning Edward and his situation.He found the family
in much better circumstances than at his previous visit.Flint
was sitting up, and was rapidly convalescing; Katy was busy and
cheerful; and it seemed a different place from that to which he had
been the messenger of hope and comfort two nights before.They were very glad to see him, and poured forth their gratitude to
him so eloquently that he was obliged to change the topic.Flint
was sure that her husband was an altered man.She had never before
known him to be so earnest and solemn in his resolutions to amend and
lead a new life.But when Harry alluded to Edward, both Katy and her mother suddenly
grew red.They acknowledged that they had sent for him in their
extremity, but that he did not come till the next morning, when the
bounty of the stable boy had relieved them from the bitterness of
want.The mother dropped a tear as she spoke of the wayward son; and
Harry had not the heart to press the inquiries he had come to make.After speaking as well as he dared to speak of Edward, he took his
leave, and hastened to the establishment of Wake & Wade, to apply for
the vacant place.He had put on his best clothes, and his appearance
this time was very creditable.Entering the store, he inquired for Edward Flint; and that gentleman
was summoned to receive him."I
declare I forgot all about you.""I thought likely," replied Harry, willing to be very charitable to
the delinquent."The fact is, we have been so busy in the store I haven't had time to
call on you, as I promised."Do you think there is any chance for me?""Wait here a moment till I speak with one of the partners."The clerk left him, and was absent but a moment, when Harry was
summoned to the private room of Mr.The gentleman questioned him
for a few moments, and seemed to be pleased with his address and his
frankness.The result of the interview was that our hero was engaged
at a salary of three dollars a week, though it was objected to him
that he had no parents residing in the city."I thought I could fix it," said Edward, complacently, as they left
the counting room."I am much obliged to you, Edward," replied Harry, willing to humor
his new friend."Now I want to get a place to board."Suppose we should both board
with your mother.""What, in a ten-footer!"exclaimed Edward, starting back with
astonishment and indignation at the proposal.If it is good enough for your mother, isn't it good enough
for you?""We can fix up a room to suit ourselves, you know.And it will be much
cheaper for both of us.""That, indeed; but the idea of boarding with the old man is not to be
thought of.""I should think you would like to be with your mother and your
brothers and sisters."The clerk promised to think about it, but did not consider it very
probable that he should agree to the proposition.Harry returned to the stable, and immediately notified Major Phillips
of his intention to leave his service.As may be supposed, the stable
keeper was sorry to lose him; but he did not wish to stand in the way
of his advancement.He paid him his wages, adding a gift of five
dollars, and kindly permitted him to leave at once, as he desired to
procure a place to board, and to acquaint himself with the localities
of the city, so that he could discharge his duty the more acceptably
to his new employers.The ostlers, too, were sorry to part with him--particularly Joe Flint,
whose admiration of our hero was unbounded.In their rough and honest
hearts they wished him well.They had often made fun of his good
principles; often laughed at him for refusing to pitch cents in the
back yard on Sunday, and for going to church instead; often ridiculed
him under the name of "Little Pious"; still they had a great respect
for him.They who are "persecuted for righteousness' sake"--who are
made fun of because they strive to do right--are always sure of
victory in the end.They may be often tried, but sooner or later they
shall triumph.After dinner, he paid another visit to Mrs.He
opened his proposition to board in her family, to which she raised
several objections, chief of which was that she had no room.The plan
was more favorably received by Katy; and she suggested that they could
hire the little apartment upstairs, which was used as a kind of lumber
room by the family in the other part of the house.Her mother finally consented to the arrangement, and it became
necessary to decide upon the terms, for Harry was a prudent manager,
and left nothing to be settled afterwards.He then introduced the
project he had mentioned to Edward; and Mrs.Flint thought she could
board them both for three dollars a week, if they could put up with
humble fare.Harry declared that he was not "difficult," though he
could not speak for Edward.Our hero was delighted with the success of his scheme, and only wished
that Edward had consented to the arrangement; but the next time he saw
him, somewhat to his surprise, the clerk withdrew his objections, and
entered heartily into the scheme."You see, Harry, I shall make a dollar a week--fifty-two dollars a
year--by the arrangement," said Edward, after he had consented.He evidently considered that some apology was due from him for
condescending from the social dignity of his position in the Green
Street boarding house to the humble place beneath his mother's roof."Certainly you will; and that is a great deal of money," replied
Harry."It will pay my theatre tickets, and for a ride once a month besides."asked Harry, astonished at his companion's theory of
economy.I mean to have a good time while I
can.""You could give your mother and Katy a great many nice things with
that money."It is all I can do to take
care of myself.""If I had a mother, and brothers and sisters, I should be glad to
spend all I got in making them happy," sighed Harry.On the following Monday morning, Harry went to his new place.Even the
language of the clerks and salesmen was strange to him; and he was
painfully conscious of the deficiencies of his education and of his
knowledge of business.He was prompt, active and zealous; yet his
awkwardness could not be concealed.The transition from the stable to
the store was as great as from a hovel to a palace.Wade swore at him; and all
the clerks made him the butt of their mirth or their ill nature, just
as they happened to feel.What seemed to him worse than all, Edward Flint joined the popular
side, and laughed and swore with the rest.Poor Harry was almost
discouraged before dinner time, and began very seriously to consider
whether he had not entirely mistaken his calling.Dinner, however,
seemed to inspire him with new courage and new energy; and he hastened
back to the store, resolved to try again.The shop was crowded with customers; and partners and clerks hallooed
"Harry" till he was so confused that he hardly knew whether he stood
on his head or his heels.It was, Come here, Go there, Bring this,
Bring that; but in spite of laugh and curse, of push and kick, he
persevered, suiting nobody, least of all himself.It was a long day, a very long day; but it came to an end at last.Our
hero had hardly strength enough left to put up the shutters.His legs
ached, his head ached, and, worst of all, his heart ached at the
manifest failure of his best intentions.He thought of going to the
partners, and asking them whether they thought he was fit for the
place; but he finally decided to try again for another day, and
dragged himself home to rest his weary limbs.He and Edward had taken possession of their room at Joe Flint's house
that morning; and on their arrival they found that Katy had put
everything in excellent order for their reception.Harry was too much
fatigued and disheartened to have a very lively appreciation of the
comforts of his new home; but Edward, notwithstanding the descent he
had made, was in high spirits.He even declared that the room they
were to occupy was better than his late apartments in Green Street."Do you think I shall get along with my work, Edward?"asked Harry,
gloomily, after they had gone to bed."Everybody in the store has kicked and cuffed me, swore at and abused
me, till I feel like a jelly.""Oh, never mind that; they always do so with a green one.They served
me just so when I first went into business.""It seemed to me just as though I never could suit them.""I can't help it, I know I did not suit them.""What made them laugh at me and swear at me, then?""That is the fashion; you must talk right up to them.If they swear at
you, swear at them back again--that is, the clerks and salesmen.If
they give you any 'lip,' let 'em have as good as they send."When you go among
the Romans, do as the Romans do."Harry did not like this advice; for he who, among the Romans, would do
as the Romans do, among hogs would do as the hogs do."If I only suit them, I don't care.""You do; I heard Wake tell Wade that you were a first-rate boy."And Harry's heart swelled with joy to think that, in spite
of his trials, he had actually triumphed in the midst of them.So he dropped the subject, with the resolution to redouble his
exertions to please his employers the next day, and turned his
thoughts to Julia Bryant, to wonder if she were still living, or had
become an angel indeed.CHAPTER XVII

IN WHICH HARRY REVISITS ROCKVILLE, AND MEETS WITH A SERIOUS LOSS


The next evening Harry was conscious of having gained a little in the
ability to discharge his novel duties.Either the partners and the
clerks had become tired of swearing and laughing at him, or he had
made a decided improvement, for less fault was found with him, and
his position was much more satisfactory.With a light heart he put up
the shutters; for though he was very much fatigued, the prestige of
future success was so cheering that he scarcely heeded his weary,
aching limbs.Every day was an improvement on the preceding day, and before the week
was out Harry found himself quite at home in his new occupation.He
was never a moment behind the time at which he was required to be at
the store in the morning.This promptness was specially noted by the
partners; for when they came to their business in the morning they
found the store well warmed, the floor nicely swept, and everything
put in order.When he was sent out with bundles he did not stop to look at the
pictures in the shop windows, to play marbles or tell long stories to
other boys in the streets.If his employers had even been very
unreasonable, they could not have helped being pleased with the new
boy, and Wake confidentially assured Wade that they had got a
treasure.He intended to make a man
of himself, and he could only accomplish his purpose by constant
exertion, by constant study and constant "trying again."He was
obliged to keep a close watch over himself, for often he was tempted
to be idle and negligent, to be careless and indifferent.After supper, on Thursday evening of his second week at Wake & Wade's,
he hastened to Major Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the
news from Rockville.His heart beat violently when he saw John's great
wagon, for he dreaded some fearful announcement from his sick friend.He had not before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness to the
little angel as now, when she lay upon the bed of pain, perhaps of
death.She had kindled in his soul a love for the good and the
beautiful.She had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference
between the right and the wrong.In a word, she was the guiding star
of his existence.Her approbation was the bright guerdon of fidelity
to truth and principle.asked Harry, without giving John time to inquire why
he had left the stable."They think she is a little grain better."continued Harry, a great load of anxiety
removed from his soul."She is; but it is very doubtful how it will turn.I went in to see
her yesterday, and she spoke of you.""She said she should like to see you.""I should like to see her very much.""Her father told me, if you was a mind to go up to Rockville, he would
pay your expenses."I will go, if I can get away."Julia is an only child, and he
would do anything in the world to please her.""I will go and see the gentlemen I work for, and if they will let me,
I will go with you to-morrow morning.""Better take the stage; you will get there so much quicker."Harry returned home to ascertain of Edward where Mr.Wake lived, and
hastened to see him.That gentleman, however, coldly assured him if he
went to Rockville he must lose his place--they could not get along
without a boy.In vain Harry urged that he should be gone but two
days; the senior was inflexible.said he to himself, when he got into the street
again.Wake says she is no relation of mine, and he don't see why
I should go.She may die, and I shall never see her again.It did not require a great deal of deliberation to convince himself
that it was his duty to visit the sick girl.She had been a true
friend to him, and he could afford to sacrifice his place to procure
her even a slight gratification.Affection and duty called him one
way, self-interest the other.If he did not go, he should regret it as
long as he lived.Wake would take him again on his
return; if not, he could at least go to work in the stable again."Edward, I am going to Rockville to-morrow," he remarked to his
"chum," on his return to Mrs."The old man agreed to it, then?He never will
let a fellow off even for a day.""He did not; but I must go."He will discharge you, for he is a hard nut.""I must go," repeated Harry, taking a candle, and going up to their
chamber."You have got more spunk than I gave you credit for; but you are sure
of losing your place," replied Edward, following him upstairs.Harry opened a drawer in the old broken bureau in the room, and from
beneath his clothes took out the great pill box which served him for a
savings bank."You have got lots of money," remarked Edward, as he glanced at the
contents of the box."Not much; only twelve dollars," replied Harry, taking out three of
them to pay his expenses to Rockville."You won't leave that box there, will you, while you are gone?"I can hide it, though, before I go."Harry took his money and went to a bookstore in Washington Street,
where he purchased an appropriate present for Julia, for which he gave
half a dollar.On his return, he wrote her name in it, with his own as
the giver.Then the safety of his money came up for consideration; and
this matter was settled by raising a loose board in the floor and
depositing the pill box in a secure place.He had scarcely done so
before Edward joined him.He was not altogether
satisfied with the step he was about to take.It was not doing right
by his employers; but he compromised the matter in part by engaging
Edward, "for a consideration," to make the fires and sweep out the
next morning.At noon, on the following day, he reached Rockville, and hastened to
the house of Mr.he asked, breathless with interest, of the girl who
answered his knock.Harry was conducted into the house, and Mr.Bryant was informed of his
presence."I am glad you have come, Harry.Julia is much better to-day," said
her father, taking him by the hand."She has frequently spoken of you
during her illness, and feels a very strong interest in your welfare."I don't know what would have become of me if
she had not been a friend to me.""That is the secret of her interest in you.We love those best whom we
serve most.She is asleep now; but you shall see her as soon as she
wakes.In the meantime you had better have your dinner."Bryant looked very pale, and his eyes were reddened with weeping.Harry saw how much he had suffered during the last fortnight; but it
seemed natural to him that he should suffer terribly at the thought of
losing one so beautiful and precious as the little angel.Bryant could not leave the
couch of the little sufferer.The fond father could speak of nothing
but Julia, and more than once the tears flooded his eyes, as he told
Harry how meek and patient she had been through the fever, how loving
she was, and how resigned even to leave her parents, and go to the
heavenly Parent, to dwell with Him forever.Harry wept, too; and after dinner he almost feared to enter the
chamber, and behold the wreck which disease had made of this bright
and beautiful form.Removing the wrapper from the book he had
brought--a volume of sweet poems, entitled "Angel Songs"--he followed
Mr.Bryant into the sick girl's chamber."Ah, Harry, I am delighted to see you!"exclaimed she, in a whisper,
for her diseased throat rendered articulation difficult and painful."I am sorry to see you so sick, Julia," replied Harry, taking the
wasted hand she extended to him.I feel as though I should get well now.""You don't know how much I have thought of you while I lay here; how I
wished you were my brother, and could come in every day and see me,"
she continued, with a faint smile."Now tell me how you get along in Boston.""Very well; but your father says I must not talk much with you now.I
have brought you a little book," and he placed it in her hand.Now, Harry, you
must read me one of the angel songs.""I will; but I can't read very well," said he, as he opened the
volume.The piece he selected was a very
pretty and a very touching little song; and Harry's feelings were so
deeply moved by the pathetic sentiments of the poem and their
adaptation to the circumstances of the case, that he was quite
eloquent.Bryant interfered to prevent further
conversation; and Julia, though she had a great deal to say to her
young friend, cheerfully yielded to her mother's wishes, and Harry
reluctantly left the room.Towards night he was permitted to see her again, when he read several
of the angel songs to her, and gave her a brief account of the events
of his residence in Boston.She was pleased with his earnestness, and
smiled approvingly upon him for the moral triumphs he had achieved.The reward of all his struggles with trial and temptation was lavishly
bestowed in her commendation, and if fidelity had not been its own
reward, he could have accepted her approval as abundant compensation
for all he had endured.There was no silly sentiment in Harry's
composition; he had read no novels, seen no plays, knew nothing of
romance even "in real life."The homage he yielded to the fair and
loving girl was an unaffected reverence for simple purity and
goodness; that which the True Heart and the True Life never fail to
call forth whenever they exert their power.On the following morning, Julia's condition was very much improved,
and the physician spoke confidently of a favorable issue.Harry was
permitted to spend an hour by her bedside, inhaling the pure spirit
that pervaded the soul of the sick one.She was so much better that
her father proposed to visit the city, to attend to some urgent
business, which had been long deferred by her illness; and an
opportunity was thus afforded for Harry to return.Bryant drove furiously in his haste, changing horses twice on the
journey, so that they reached the city at one o'clock.On their
arrival, Harry's attention naturally turned to the reception he
expected to receive from his employers.He had not spoken of his
relations with them at Rockville, preferring not to pain them, on the
one hand, and not to take too much credit to himself for his devotion
to Julia, on the other.After the horse was disposed of at Major
Phillips's stable, Mr.Bryant walked down town with Harry; and when
they reached the store of Wake & Wade, he entered with him.asked the senior partner, rather
coldly, when he saw the delinquent.Harry was confused at this reception, though it was not unexpected."I didn't know but that you might be willing to take me again."Did you say that you did not want my
young friend, here?"Bryant, taking the offered hand of
Mr."I did say so," said the senior."I was not aware that he was your
friend, though," and he proceeded to inform Mr.Bryant that Harry had
left them against their wish."A few words with you, if you please."Wake conducted him to the private office, where they remained for
half an hour."It is all right, Harry," continued Mr.ejaculated our hero, rejoiced to find his place was
still secure."I would not have gone if I could possibly have helped
it.""You did right, my boy, and I honor you for your courage and
constancy."Bryant bade him an affectionate adieu, promising to write to him
often until Julia recovered, and then departed.With a grateful heart Harry immediately resumed his duties, and the
partners were probably as glad to retain him as he was to remain.At night, when he went to his chamber, he raised the loose board to
get the pill box, containing his savings, in order to return the money
he had not expended.To his consternation, he discovered that it was
gone!CHAPTER XVIII

IN WHICH HARRY MEETS WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND GETS A HARD KNOCK ON
THE HEAD


It was in vain that Harry searched beneath the broken floor for his
lost treasure; it could not be found.He raised the boards up, and
satisfied himself that it had not slipped away into any crevice, or
fallen through into the room below; and the conclusion was inevitable
that the box had been stolen.The mystery confused Harry, for he was certain
that no one had seen him deposit the box beneath the floor.No one
except Edward even knew that he had any money.Flint nor Katy would have stolen it; and he was not
willing to believe that his room-mate would be guilty of such a mean
and contemptible act.He tried to assure himself that it had not been stolen--that it was
still somewhere beneath the floor; and he pulled up another board, to
resume the search.He had scarcely done so before Edward joined him.he asked, apparently very much astonished
at his chum's occupation."Are you going to pull the house down?"replied Harry, suspending
operations to watch Edward's expression when he told him of his loss."Put it here, under this loose board."Edward manifested a great deal of enthusiasm in the search.He was
sure it must be where Harry had put it, or that it had rolled back out
of sight; and he began tearing up the floor with a zeal that
threatened the destruction of the building.But the box could not be
found, and they were obliged to abandon the search."That is a fact; I can't spare that money, anyhow.I have been a good
while earning it, and it is too thundering bad to lose it.""I don't understand it," continued Edward."Nor I either," replied Harry, looking his companion sharp in the eye."No one knew I had it but you.""Do you mean to say I stole it?"exclaimed Edward, doubling his fist,
while his cheek reddened with anger.I didn't mean to lay it to you."And Edward was very glad to have the matter compromised."I did not; perhaps I spoke hastily.You know how hard I worked for
this money; and it seems hard to lose it.But no matter; I will try
again."Flint and Katy were much grieved when Harry told of his loss.They looked as though they suspected Edward, but said nothing, for it
was very hard to accuse a son or a brother of such a crime.Flint advised Harry to put his money in the savings bank in
future, promising to take care of his spare funds till they amounted
to five dollars, which was then the smallest sum that would be
received.It was a long time before our hero became reconciled to his
loss.He had made up his mind to be a rich man; and he had carefully
hoarded every cent he could spare, thus closely imitating the man who
got rich by saving his fourpences.A few days after the loss he was reading in one of Katy's Sunday
school books about a miser.The wretch was held up as a warning to
young folks by showing them how he starved his body and soul for the
sake of gold.exclaimed Harry, as he laid the book
upon the window."I have been hoarding up my money just like this old man in the book."You couldn't be mean and stingy if you
tried.""A miser wouldn't do what you did for us, Harry," added Mrs."I have been thinking too much of money.After all, perhaps it was
just as well that I lost that money.""I am sorry you lost it; for I don't think there is any danger of your
becoming a miser," said Katy."Perhaps not; at any rate, it has set me to thinking."Harry finished the book; and it was, fortunately, just such a work as
he required to give him right and proper views in regard to the value
of wealth.His dream of being a rich man was essentially modified by
these views; and he renewedly resolved that it was better to be a good
man than a rich man, if he could not be both.It seemed to him a
little remarkable that the minister should preach upon this very topic
on the following Sunday, taking for his text the words, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you."He was deeply impressed by the sermon, probably because it was on a
subject to which he had given some attention.A few days after his return from Rockville, Harry received a very
cheerful letter from Mr.Bryant, to which Julia had added a few lines
in a postscript.The little angel was rapidly recovering, and our hero
was rejoiced beyond expression.The favorable termination of her
illness was a joy which far outbalanced the loss of his money, and he
was as cheerful and contented as ever.As he expressed it, in rather
homely terms, he had got "the streak of fat and the streak of lean."Julia was alive; was to smile upon him again; was still to inspire him
with that love of goodness which had given her such an influence over
him.Week after week passed by, and Harry heard nothing of his lost
treasure; but Julia had fully recovered, and for the treasure lost an
incomparably greater treasure had been gained.Edward and himself
continued to occupy the same room, though ever since the loss of the
money box Harry's chum had treated him coldly.There had never been
much sympathy between them; for while Edward was at the theatre, or
perhaps at worse places, Harry was at home, reading some good book,
writing a letter to Rockville, or employed in some other worthy
occupation.While Harry was at church or at the Sunday school, Edward,
in company with some dissolute companion, was riding about the
adjacent country.Flint often remonstrated with her son upon the life he led, and
the dissipated habits he was contracting; and several times Harry
ventured to introduce the subject.Edward, however, would not hear a
word from either.It is true that we either grow better or worse, as
we advance in life; and Edward Flint's path was down a headlong steep.His mother wept and begged him to be a better boy.Harry often wondered how he could afford to ride out and visit the
theatre and other places of amusement so frequently.His salary was
only five dollars a week now; it was only four when he had said it was
five.He seemed to have money at all times, and to spend it very
freely.He could not help believing that the contents of his pill box
had paid for some of the "stews" and "Tom and Jerrys" which his
reckless chum consumed.But the nine dollars he had lost would have
been but a drop in the bucket compared with his extravagant outlays.One day, about six months after Harry's return from Rockville, as he
was engaged behind the counter, a young man entered the store and
accosted him.It was a familiar voice; and, to Harry's surprise, but not much to his
satisfaction, he recognized his old companion, Ben Smart, who, he had
learned from Mr.Bryant, had been sent to the house of correction for
burning Squire Walker's barn."Yes, I have been here six months.""You have got a sign out for a boy, I see."There were more errands to run than one boy
could attend to; besides, Harry had proved himself so faithful and so
intelligent, that Mr.Wake wished to retain him in the store, to fit
him for a salesman."You can speak a good word for me, Harry; for I should like to work
here," continued Ben."I thought you were in--in the--"

Harry did not like to use the offensive expression, and Ben's face
darkened when he discovered what the other was going to say."Not a word about that," said he."If you ever mention that little
matter, I'll take your life.""My father got me out, and then I ran away.Not a word more, for I had
as lief be hung for an old sheep as a lamb."Wake; you can apply to him," continued Harry.The senior
talked with him a few moments, and then retired to his private office,
calling Harry as he entered."If you say anything, I will be the death of you," whispered Ben, as
Harry passed him on his way to the office.Our hero was not particularly pleased with these threats; he certainly
was not frightened by them.Wake, as he presented himself
before the senior."Who is he, and what is he?"Bryant told you the story about my leaving Redfield,"
said Harry."That is the boy that run away with me.""And the one that set the barn afire?"And Harry returned to his work at the counter.Before Harry had time to make any reply, Mr."We don't want you, young man," said he.With a glance of hatred at Harry, the applicant left the store.Since
leaving Redfield, our hero's views of duty had undergone a change; and
he now realized that to screen a wicked person was to plot with him
against the good order of society.He knew Ben's character; he had no
reason, after their interview, to suppose it was changed; and he could
not wrong his employers by permitting them ignorantly to engage a bad
boy, especially when he had been questioned directly on the point.Towards evening Harry was sent with a bundle to a place in Boylston
Street, which required him to cross the Common.On his return, when he
reached the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who had evidently
followed him, and lay in wait at this spot for him, sprang from his
covert upon him.The young villain struck him a heavy blow in the eye
before Harry realized his purpose.The blow, however, was vigorously
returned; but Ben, besides being larger and stronger than his victim,
had a large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a blow on the
side of his head, knocking him insensible to the ground.The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled along the side of
the walk of the burying ground, pursued by several persons who had
witnessed the assault.Ben was a fleet runner this time, and succeeded
in making his escape.CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEN HEAD MAY BE OF SOME USE TO A
PERSON


When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found himself in an
elegantly furnished chamber, with several persons standing around the
bed upon which he had been laid.A physician was standing over him,
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received in the side of
his head."There, young man, you have had a narrow escape," said the doctor, as
he saw his patient's eyes open.asked Harry, faintly, as he tried to concentrate his
wandering senses."You are in good hands, my boy.replied the sufferer, trying to
rise on the bed."Do you feel as though you could walk home?""I don't know; I feel kind of faint.""No, sir; it feels numb, and everything seems to be flying round."Harry expressed an earnest desire to go home, and the physician
consented to accompany him in a carriage to Mrs.He
had been conveyed in his insensible condition to a house in Boylston
Street, the people of which were very kind to him, and used every
effort to make him comfortable.A carriage was procured, and Harry was assisted to enter it; for he
was so weak and confused that he could not stand alone.Ben had struck
him a terrible blow; and, as the physician declared, it was almost a
miracle that he had not been killed.Flint and Katy were shocked and alarmed when they saw the
helpless boy borne into the house; but everything that the
circumstances required was done for him.he asked, when they had placed him on the bed."They will wonder what has become of me at the store," continued the
sufferer, whose thoughts reverted to his post of duty."I will go down to the store and tell them what has happened," said
Mr.Callender, the kind gentleman to whose house Harry had been
carried, and who had attended him to his home."Thank you, sir; you are very good.I don't want them to think that I
have run away, or anything of that sort.""They will not think so, I am sure," returned Mr.Callender, as he
departed upon his mission."Do you think I can go to the store to-morrow?"asked Harry, turning
to the physician."I am afraid not; you must keep very quiet for a time."He had never been sick a day in
his life; and it seemed to him just then as though the world could not
possibly move on without him to help the thing along.A great many
persons cherish similar notions, and cannot afford to be sick a single
day.I should like to tell my readers at some length what blessings come to
us while we are sick; what angels with healing ministrations for the
soul visit the couch of pain; what holy thoughts are sometimes kindled
in the darkened chamber; what noble resolutions have their birth in
the heart when the head is pillowed on the bed of sickness.But my
remaining space will not permit it; and I content myself with
remarking that sickness in its place is just as great a blessing as
health; that it is a part of our needed discipline.When any of my
young friends are sick, therefore, let them yield uncomplainingly to
their lot, assured that He who hath them in his keeping "doeth all
things well."Harry was obliged to learn this lesson; and when the pain in his head
began to be almost intolerable, he fretted and vexed himself about
things at the store.He was not half as patient as he might have been;
and, during the evening, he said a great many hard things about Ben
Smart, the author of his misfortune.I am sorry to say he cherished
some malignant, revengeful feelings towards him, and looked forward
with a great deal of satisfaction to the time when he should be
arrested and punished for his crime.Wade called upon him as soon as they heard of
his misfortune.They were very indignant when they learned that Harry
was suffering for telling the truth.They assured him that they should
miss him very much at the store, but they would do the best they
could--which, of course, was very pleasant to him.But they told him
they could get along without him, bade him not fret, and said his
salary should be paid just the same as though he did his work.Wade continued; "and, as it will cost you more to be sick,
we will raise your wages to four dollars a week."Certainly," replied the junior, warmly.There was no possible excuse for fretting now.With so many kind
friends around him, he had no excuse for fretting; but his human
nature rebelled at his lot, and he made himself more miserable than
the pain of his wound could possibly have made him.Flint, who
sat all night by his bedside, labored in vain to make him resigned to
his situation.It seemed as though the great trial of his lifetime had
come--that which he was least prepared to meet and conquer.His head ached, and the pain of his
wound was very severe.His moral condition was, if possible, worse
than on the preceding night.He was fretful, morose, and unreasonable
towards those kind friends who kept vigil around his bedside.Strange
as it may seem, and strange as it did seem to himself, his thoughts
seldom reverted to the little angel.Once, when he thought of her
extended on the bed of pain as he was then, her example seemed to
reproach him.She had been meek and patient through all her
sufferings--had been content to die, even, if it was the will of the
Father in heaven.With a peevish exclamation, he drove her--his
guardian angel, as she often seemed to him--from his mind, with the
reflection that she could not have been as sick as he was, that she
did not endure as much pain as he did.For several days he remained in
pretty much the same state.His head ached, and the fever burned in
his veins.His moral symptoms were not improved, and he continued to
snarl and growl at those who took care of him."Give me some cold water, marm; I don't want your slops," fretted he,
when Mrs."But the doctor says you mustn't have cold water."Give me a glass of cold water, and I will--"

The door opened then, causing him to suspend the petulant words; for
one stood there whose good opinion he valued more than that of any
other person.I am so sorry to see you so sick!"exclaimed Julia Bryant,
rushing to his bedside.She was followed by her father and mother; and Katy had admitted them
unannounced to the chamber.replied Harry, smiling for the first time since
the assault."Yes, Harry; I hope you are better.When I heard about it last night,
I would not give father any peace till he promised to bring me to
Boston.""Don't be so wild, Julia," interposed her mother."You forget that he
is very sick.""Forgive me, Harry; I was so glad and so sorry.I hope I didn't make
your head ache," she added, in a very gentle tone.It was very good of you to come and see me."Harry felt a change come over him the moment she entered the room.The
rebellious thoughts in his bosom seemed to be banished by her
presence; and though his head ached and his flesh burned as much as
ever, he somehow had more courage to endure them.Bryant had asked him a few questions, and expressed
their sympathy in proper terms, they departed, leaving Julia to remain
with the invalid for a couple of hours."I did not expect to see you, Julia," said Harry, when they had gone."Didn't you think I would do as much for you as you did for me?"I am only a poor boy, and you are a
rich man's child."You can't think how bad I
felt when father got Mr."It's a hard case to be knocked down in that way, and laid up in the
house for a week or two.""I know it; but we must be patient."I haven't any patience--not a bit.If I could get
hold of Ben Smart, I would choke him.I hope they will catch him and
send him to the state prison for life."These malignant words did not sound like those of
the Harry West she had known and loved.They were so bitter that they
curdled the warm blood in her veins, and the heart of Harry seemed
less tender than before."Harry," said she, in soft tones, and so sad that he could not but
observe the change which had come over her."No, I am sure you don't.asked he, deeply impressed by the sad and solemn
tones of the little angel."Forgive Ben Smart, after he has almost killed me?"Julia took up the
Bible, which lay on the table by the bedside--it was the one she had
given him--and read several passages upon the topic she had
introduced.The gentle rebuke she administered
touched his soul, and he thought how peevish and ill-natured he had
been."You have been badly hurt, Harry, and you are very sick.Now, let me
ask you one question: Which would you rather be, Harry West, sick as
you are, or Ben Smart, who struck the blow?""I had rather be myself," replied he, promptly."You ought to be glad that you are Harry West, instead of Ben Smart.Sick as you are, I am sure you are a great deal happier than he can
be, even if he is not punished for striking you."Here I have been
grumbling and growling all the time for four days.It is lucky for me that I am Harry, instead of Ben.""I am sure I have been a great deal better since I was sick than
before.When I lay on the bed, hardly able to move, I kept thinking
all the time; and my thoughts did me a great deal of good."Harry had learned his lesson, and Julia's presence was indeed an
angel's visit.For an hour longer she sat by his bed, and her words
were full of inspiration; and when her father called for her he could
hardly repress a tear as she bade him good night.Flint and Katy to forgive him for
being so cross, promising to be patient in the future.She read to him, conversed
with him about the scenes of the preceding autumn in the woods, and
told him again about her own illness.In the afternoon she bade him a
final adieu, as she was to return that day to her home.The patience and resignation which he had learned gave a favorable
turn to his sickness, and he began to improve.It was a month,
however, before he was able to take his place in the store again.Without the assistance of Julia, perhaps, he had not learned the moral
of sickness so well.As it was, he came forth from his chamber with
truer and loftier motives, and with a more earnest desire to lead the
true life.Ben Smart had been arrested; and, shortly after his recovery, Harry
was summoned as a witness at his trial.It was a plain case, and Ben
was sent to the house of correction for a long term.CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS
GREATEST TRIUMPH


Three years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim
through life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as "a
tale that is told."To note all the events of Harry's experience
through this period would require another volume; therefore I can only
tell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that
time.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were
overcome without care and privation.Often he failed, was often
disappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred
against the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things
which would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur
and influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,
causing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while
the body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew
older, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and
the object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an
attentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his
character was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and
tried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials
and temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he
associated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is
true, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and
dissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet
he had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a
salary of five dollars a week.Flint,
though Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient
to disgust his "fast" companion with the homely fare and homely
quarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight
dollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class
hotel.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the
Savings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully
watched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very
handsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended
them in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,
it was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the
poor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had
inherited, he might never have known that it was "more blessed to give
than to receive."As he grew older, and the worth of money was more
apparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care
of themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his
gifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no
more ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,
encouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a
year since he had been on a "spree."Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before
the event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of
his life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of
interest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had
first met the "little angel"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he
could not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he
first began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that
he had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom
of childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in
each, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence
between them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the
interference of the "powers" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing
sense of the "fitness of things" in the parties.But they occasionally
met, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety
demanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's
severest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and
his increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry
saw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard
him say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he
attended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore
a gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder
that he was "short."He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though
eight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his
expenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five
dollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he
was good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially
as Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the
occasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth
some excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he
obtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a
two-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a
further application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when
Edward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got
his money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to
dinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when
they had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as
rather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of
his employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, "we have been losing money from the store for
the last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times."exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a
confidant or as the suspected person."To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he
purchased some goods."Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself."I can form no idea, sir," returned Harry."I can only speak for
myself.""Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you," added Mr."I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to
keep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon."Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them
in such a way that they could be readily identified, and then
dismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles
Wallis were in close conversation."I say, Harry, what's in the wind?"asked the former, as our hero
returned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who
were very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much
alike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that
something unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen
spools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his
eye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he
knew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was
the guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any
result was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on
the fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal
of money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making
change, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he
forgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to
inform Mr."Only to the office," replied he; and his appearance and manner might
have attracted the attention of any skillful rogue."Come, Harry, don't leave your place," added Edward, playfully
grasping him by the collar, on his return."Don't stop to fool, Edward," answered Harry, as he shook him off and
took his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame
shook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very
unpleasant business."Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of
your pockets, Edward," said Mr."Certainly not, sir;" and he turned every one of his pockets inside
out.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,
for that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully
expected to convict the culprit on the spot."I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this," continued
Edward, with a sneer."I'll bet five dollars he stole the money
himself, if any has been stolen."Search me, sir, by all means," added Harry; and he began to turn his
pockets out.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop
bill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my
pocket.""But you seem to know more about it than Edward," remarked Mr.Wade,
as he took the parcel.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it
contained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to
condemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,
there was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that
our hero was the victim of a conspiracy."As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake," interposed
Edward, "I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My
mother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,
you will find more marked pieces."Wake, I'm innocent," protested Harry, when he had in some measure
recovered from the first shock of the heavy blow."I never stole a
cent from anybody.""I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this
money happened to be in your pocket?"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs."Don't let him go with you, though," said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the
money, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone."So you have been
watching me, I thought as much."Wade told me to do," replied Harry, exceedingly
mortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and
lay it to me!""I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it
possible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be
a thief?But your career is finished," said he, very sternly, as he
entered the office."Nothing strange to the rest of us," added Edward."I never knew one
yet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal."Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite," replied Harry, with
spirit."I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,
at Mrs.Flint's," said the senior, severely.Those half dollars were part of the money paid
him by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise."I
never borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid
him a cent."Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered
the monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but
the young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and
art that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were
against him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in
Leverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he
was not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon
that special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate
him from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say
when she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he
was sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced
when she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in
proportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name
was called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an
exclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and
monstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity
of the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner
saved him.Wake, he questioned him in
regard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the
most intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,
as the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the
lawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to
the prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's
counsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or
paid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's
arrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had
returned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in
relation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to
unmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to
pay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason
the fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He
produced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from
Edward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his
confusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his
coolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally
acknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close
questioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found
in Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the
shop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his
return from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the
thief.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he
had managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate
Harry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly
interposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy
termination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly
man elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood."Young man, what is your father's name?"he asked, in tones tremulous
with emotion."You had a father--what was his name?""Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to
Valparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from
him."exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while
the tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement."Is it possible that you are my father?""I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing
me that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I
met a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also."They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to
the store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed
that, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had
accomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which
had nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;
and since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing
to send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to
his wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of
the death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his
remaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a
condition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had
rendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his
remaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and
happened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son
who, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.Edward Flint finished his career of "fashionable dissipation" by being
sentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he
confessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,
three years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of
accompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.He was in exuberant
spirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly
realize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared
the joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how
astonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see
the spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his
father--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of
his life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through
trial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found
a rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is
in those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,
of his career have planted in his soul.CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN
END


Perhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's
subsequent life; and we will "drop in" upon him at his pleasant
residence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The
years have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant
discharge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return
to his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into
possession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him
to choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West
is quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time
at his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the
village, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from
the turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of
the charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two
nights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very
rock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel
brought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the
side of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the
events of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected
with the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or
gay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the
articles are rich and tasteful.Who is that
beautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?Do you not recognize her,
gentle reader?West, and an old
acquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell
her height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much
of an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in
the garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and
though he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks
he is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so
himself."This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and
see friend Nason," said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his
wife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's."Do you see that high rock, Julia?""That is the very one where I dodged Leman, and took the back track;
and there is where I knocked the bull-dog over."It is a pleasant little
cottage, for he is no longer in the service of the town.Connected with it is a fine farm of
twenty acres.Nason by his
protege, though no money was paid.Harry would have made it a free
gift, if the pride of his friend would have permitted; but it amounts
to the same thing.West and his lady are warmly welcomed by Mr.The ex-keeper is an old man now.He is a member of the church, and

and when they fail to be as good and true as they wish to be, to TRY
AGAIN.THE END

NEW YORK, N. Y.These and all other orders
sent here during the last two years must be strictly observed, such
as the sending to Batavia of the old muskets, the river navigation
of ships and sloops, the reduction of native weights and measures to
Dutch pounds, the carrying over of the old credits and debits into
the new accounts, the making and use of casks of a given measure,
and the accounting for the new casks of meat, bacon, butter, and
all such orders, which cannot be all mentioned here, but which Your
Honours must look up now and again so as not to forget any and thus
be involved in difficulties.[(30)]

The debts due to the Company at the closing of the accounts must be
entered in a separate memorandum, and submitted with the accounts.In
this memorandum the amount of the debt must be stated, with the name
of the debtor, and whether there is a prospect of the amount being
recovered or not.As shown by Their Excellencies, these outstandings
amounted at the closing of the accounts at the end of February, 1694,
to the sum of Fl.This was reduced on my last departure
to Colombo to Fl.31,948.9.15, as may be seen in the memorandum by the
Administrateur of January 31, 1696.I will now proceed to show that on
my present departure no more is due than the amount of Fl.16,137.8,
in which, however, the rent of the farmers is not included, as it is
only provisional and will be paid up each month, viz.:--


                                                    Fl.The Province of Timmoraten                 376.2.8 [40]
        The Province of Pathelepally               579.10.0

                                      Total     16,137.0.8


With regard to the debt of the weavers, amounting to Fl.2,616.8,
I deem it necessary here to mention that the arrears in Timmoratsche
and Patchelepally, spoken of in the memorandum by the Administrateur
of January 31, 1696, compiled by Mr.Bierman on my orders of November
30, 1695, after the closing of the accounts at the end of August,
of which those of Tandia Moety and Naga Chitty and that of the
Company's weavers which refer to the same persons, may, in my opinion,
be considered as irrecoverable.It would therefore be best if Their
Excellencies at Batavia would exempt them from the payment.This debt
dates from the time when it was the intention to induce some weavers
from the opposite coast to come here for the weaving of cloth for the
Company.This caste, called Sinias, [41] received the said amount in
cash, thread, and cotton in advance, and thus were involved in this
large debt, which having been reduced to the amount stated above, has
remained for some years exactly the same, in spite of all endeavours
made to collect it, and notwithstanding that the Paybook-keeper was
appointed to see that the materials were not stolen and the money not
wasted.It has been, however, all in vain, because these people were
so poor that they could not help stealing if they were to live, and it
seems impossible to recover the amount, which was due at first from
200 men, out of whom only 15 or 16 are left now.When they do happen
occasionally to deliver a few gingams, these are so inferior that
the soldiers who receive them at the price of good materials complain
a great deal.I think it unfair that the military should be made to
pay in this way, as the gingams are charged by the Sinias at Fl.6
or 6.10 a piece, while the soldiers have to accept the same at Fl.The same is the case with the Moeris and other cloths which
are delivered by the Sinias, or rather which are obtained from them
with much difficulty; and I have no doubt Your Honours will receive
instructions from Batavia with regard to this matter.Meanwhile they
must be dealt with in the ordinary way; but in case they are exempted
from the payment of their debt I think they ought to be sent out of
the country, not only because they are not liable to taxes or services
to the Company, but also because of the idolatry and devil-worship
which they have to a certain extent been allowed to practise, and
which acts as a poison to the other inhabitants, among whom we have
so long tried to introduce the Dutch Reformed religion.The debt of the dyers at Annecatte, entered under the name of Manoel of
Annecatte, dyer, which amounted at the end of August to Fl.9,823.6,
has been since reduced by Fl.707.10, and is still being reduced
daily, as there is sufficient work at present to keep them all busy,
of which mention has been made under the heading of Dye-roots.This
debt amounted at the end of February, 1694, to Fl.11,920.13.6, so
that since that time one-third has been recovered.This is done by
retaining half the pay for dyeing; for when they deliver red cloth
they only receive half of their pay, and there is thus a prospect
of the whole of this debt being recovered.Care must be taken that
no one gives them any money on interest, which has been prohibited,
because it was found that selfish people, aware of the poverty of
these dyers, sometimes gave them money, not only on interest but at
a usurious rate, so that they lost also half of the pay they received
from the Company on account of those debts, and were kept in continual
poverty, which made them either despondent or too lazy to work.For
this reason an order was issued during the time of the late Commandeur
Blom that such usurers would lose all they had lent to these dyers,
as the Company would not interfere on behalf of the creditors as long
as the debt to the Company was still due.On this account also their
lands have been mortgaged to the Company, and Mr.Blom proposed in
his questions of December 22, 1693, that these should be sold.But
this will not be necessary now, and it would not be advantageous to
the Company if the weavers were thus ruined, while on the other hand
this debt may on the whole be recovered.(31)

The Tannekares are people who made a contract with the Company during
the time of Mr.Blom by a deed bearing date June 7, 1691, in terms
of which they were to deliver two elephants without teeth in lieu
of their poll tax amounting to Fl.269.4.17/60 and for their Oely
service.It was found, however, last August that they were in arrears
for 11 animals, which, calculated at Rds.150 each, brings
their debts to Fl.As all contracts of this
kind for the delivery of elephants are prejudicial to the Company,
I proposed on January 22, 1695, that this contract should be annulled,
stating our reasons for doing so.This proposal was submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia in our letter of August 12 of the same year,
and was approved by them by their letter of December 12, 1695, so that
these people are again in the same position as the other inhabitants,
and will be taxed by the Thombo-keeper for poll tax, land rent, and
Oely service from September 1, 1696.These they must be made to pay,
and they also must be made to pay up the arrears, which they are quite
capable of doing, which matter must be recommended to the attention
of the tax collector in Waddamoraatsche.The debt due by the dyers of Nalloer and Point Pedro, which arose
from their receiving half their pay in advance at their request,
as they were not able to pay their poll tax and land rent (which
amounted to Fl.566.14), has been paid up since.The debt of Don Philip Nellamapane, which amounts to Fl.375, arose
from the amount being lent to him for the purchase of nely in the
latter part of 1694, because there was a complaint that the Wannias,
through a failure of the crop, did not have a sufficient quantity
of grain for the maintenance of the hunters.This money was handed
to Don Gaspar Ilengenarene Mudaliyar, brother-in-law of Don Philip,
and at the request of the latter; so that really, not he, but Don
Gaspar, owes the money.He must be urged to pay up this amount,
which it would be less difficult to do if they were not so much in
arrears with their tribute, because in that case the first animals
they delivered could be taken in payment.There is no doubt, however,
that this debt will be paid if they are urged.The same is the case with the sum of Fl.150 which Ambelewanne Wannia
owes, but as he has to deliver only a few elephants this small amount
can be settled the first time he delivers any elephants above his
tribute.(32)

The Pay Accounts must, like the Trade Accounts, be closed on the
last day of August every year, in compliance with the orders of the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India contained in their letter
of August 13, 1695.They must also be audited and examined, according
to the Resolution passed in the Council of India on September 6,
1694, so that it may be seen whether all the items entered in the
Trade Accounts for payments appear also in the Pay Accounts, while
care must be taken that those who are in arrears at the close of the
books on account of advance received do not receive such payments too
liberally, against which Your Honours will have to guard, so that no
difficulties may arise and the displeasure of Their Excellencies may
not be incurred.Care must also be taken that the various instructions
for the Paybook-keeper are observed, such as those passed by Resolution
of Their Excellencies on August 27 and June 29, 1694, with regard to
the appraising, selling, and entering in the accounts of estates left
by the Company's servants, the rules for the Curators ad lites, those
with regard to the seizure of salaries by private debtors passed by
Resolution of August 5, 1696, in the Council of India, and the rules
passed by Resolution of March 20, with regard to such sums belonging
to the Company's servants as may be found outstanding on interest
after their death, namely, that these must four or six weeks after
be transferred from the Trade Accounts into the Pay Accounts to the
credit of the deceased.(33)

The matter of the Secretariate not being conducted as it ought to
be, cannot be dealt with in full here.It was said in the letters
of November 17 and December 12, 1696, that the new Secretary,
Mr.Bout (who was sent here without any previous intimation to the
Commandeur), would see that all documents were properly registered,
bound, and preserved, but these are the least important duties
of a good Secretary.I cannot omit to recommend here especially
that a journal should be kept, in which all details are entered,
because there are many occurrences with regard to the inhabitants,
the country, the trade, elephants, &c., which it will be impossible to
find when necessary unless they appear in the letters sent to Colombo,
which, however, do not always deal very circumstancially with these
matters.It will be best therefore to keep an accurate journal,
which I found has been neglected for the last three years, surely
much against the intention of the Company.The Secretary must also
see that the Scholarchial resolutions and the notes made on them by
the Political Council are copied and preserved at the Secretariate,
another duty which has not been done for some years.I know on the
other hand that a great deal of the time of the Secretary is taken up
with the keeping of the Treasury Accounts, while there is no Chief
Clerk here to assist him with the Treasury Accounts, or to assist
the Commandeur.Blom, and he proposed
in his letters of February 12 and March 29, 1693, to Colombo that
the Treasury Accounts should be kept by the Paybook-keeper, which,
in my humble opinion, would be the best course, as none of the four
Onderkooplieden [42] here could be better employed for this work
than the Paybook-keeper.It must be remembered, however, that Their
Excellencies do not wish the Regulation of December 29, 1692, to be
altered or transgressed, so that these must be still observed.I would
propose a means by which the duties of the Cashier, and consequently of
the Secretary, could be much decreased, considering that the Cashier
can get no other knowledge of the condition of the general revenue
than from the Thombo-keeper who makes up the accounts, namely, that
the Thombo-keeper should act as General Accountant, as well of the
rent for leases as of the poll tax, land rent, tithes, &c., in which
case the native collectors could give their accounts to him.This,
I expect, would simplify matters, and enable the Secretary to be of
more assistance to the Commandeur.In case such arrangement should be
made, the General Accountant could keep the accounts of the revenue
specified above, which could afterwards be transferred to the accounts
of the Treasury; but Your Honours must wait for the authority to do
so, as I do not wish to take this responsibility.I must recommend
to Your Honours here to see that in future no petitions with regard
to fines are written for the inhabitants except by the Secretaries
of the Political Council or the Court of Justice, as those officers
in India act as Notaries.This has to be done because the petitions
from these rebellious people of Jaffnapatam are so numerous that the
late Mr.Blom had to forbid some of them writing such communications,
because even Toepasses and Mestices take upon themselves to indite
such letters, which pass under the name of petitions, but are often so
full of impertinent and seditious expressions that they more resemble
libels than petitions.Since neither superior nor inferior persons
are spared in these documents, it is often impossible to discover the
author.Whenever the inhabitants have any complaint to make, I think
it will be sufficient if they ask either of the two Secretaries to
draw out a petition for them in which their grievances are stated,
which may be sent to Colombo if the case cannot be decided here.In
this way it will be possible to see that the petitions are written
on stamped paper as ordered by the Company, while they will be
written with the moderation and discrimination that is necessary in
petitions.There are also brought to the Secretariate every year all
sorts of native protocols, such as those kept by the schoolmasters
at the respective churches, deeds, contracts, ola deeds of sale,
and other instruments as may have been circulated among the natives,
which it is not possible to attend to at the Dutch Secretariate.But
as I have been informed that the schoolmasters do not always observe
the Company's orders, and often issue fraudulent instruments and thus
deceive their own countrymen, combining with the Majoraals and the
Chiefs of the Aldeas, by whom a great deal of fraud is committed,
it will be necessary for the Dessave to hold an inquiry and punish
the offenders or deliver them up for punishment.For this purpose
he must read and summarize the instructions with regard to this and
other matters issued successively by Their Excellencies the Governors
of Ceylon and the subaltern Commandeurs of this Commandement, to be
found in the placaats and notices published here relating to this
Commandement.The most important of these rules must be published in
the different churches from time to time, as the people of Jaffnapatam
are much inclined to all kinds of evil practices, which has been
the reason that so many orders and regulations had to be issued by
the placaats, all which laws are the consequence of transgressions
committed.Yet it is very difficult to make these people observe
the rules so long as they find but the least encouragement given to
them by the higher authorities, as stated already.It was decided in
the Meeting of Council of October 20, 1696, that a large number of
old and useless olas which were kept at the Secretariate and were
a great encumbrance should be sorted, and the useless olas burnt
in the presence of a committee, while the Mallabaar and Portuguese
documents concerning the Thombo or description of lands were to be
placed in the custody of the Thombo-keeper.This may be seen in the
report of November 8 of the same year.In this way the Secretariate
has been cleared, and the documents concerning the Thombo put in their
proper place, where they must be kept in future; so that the different
departments may be kept separately with a view to avoid confusion.I
have also noticed on various occasions that the passports of vessels
are lost, either at the Secretariate or elsewhere.Therefore, even so
lately as last December, instructions were sent to Kayts and Point
Pedro to send all such passports here as soon as possible.These
passports, on the departure of the owners, were to be kept at the
Secretariate after renovation by endorsement, unless they were more
than six months old, in which case a new passport was to be issued.In
case Your Honours are not sufficiently acquainted with the form of
these passports and how they are to be signed as introduced by His
late Excellency Governor van Mydregt, you will find the necessary
information in the letters from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of 1687 and
1688 and another from Colombo to Jaffnapatam bearing date April 11,
1690, in which it is stated to what class of persons passports may
be issued.The same rules must be observed in Manaar so far as this
district is concerned, in compliance with the orders contained in
the letter of November 13, 1696.(34)

The Court of Justice has of late lost much of its prestige among the
inhabitants, because, seeing that the Bellale Mudaly Tamby, to whom
previous reference has been made, succeeded on a simple petition sent
to Colombo to escape the Court of Justice while his case was still
undecided (as may be seen from a letter from Colombo of January 6,
1696, and the reply thereto of the 26th of this month), they have an
idea that they cannot be punished here.Even people of the lowest caste
threaten that they will follow the same course whenever they think
they will not gain their object here, especially since they have seen
with what honours Mudaly Tamby was sent back and how the Commissioners
did all he desired, although his own affairs were not even sufficiently
settled yet.A great deal may be stated and proved on this subject, but
as this is not the place to do so, I will only recommend Your Honours
to uphold the Court of Justice in its dignity as much as possible,
and according to the rules and regulations laid down with regard to
it in the Statutes of Batavia and other Instructions.The principal
rule must be that every person receives speedy and prompt justice,
which for various reasons could not be done in the case of Mudaly
Tamby, and the opportunity was given for his being summoned to Colombo.At present the Court of Justice consists of the following persons:--


The Commandeur, President (absent).Dessave de Bitter, Vice-President.van der Bruggen, Administrateur.The Thombo-keeper, Pieter Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos.The Onderkoopman Jan van Groeneveld.But it must be considered that on my departure to Mallabaar, and in
case the Dessave be commissioned to the pearl fishery, this College
will be without a President; the Onderkooplieden Bolscho and Roos
may also be away in the interior for the renovation of the Head
Thombo, and it may also happen that Lieut.Claas Isaacsz will be
appointed Lieutenant-Dessave, in which case he also would have to go
to the interior; in such case there would be only three members left
besides the complainant ex-officio and the Secretary, who would have
no power to pronounce sentence.The Lieutenant van Hovingen and the
Secretary of the Political Council could be appointed for the time,
but in that case the Court would be more a Court Martial than a Court
of Justice, consisting of three Military men and two Civil Servants,
while there would be neither a President nor a Vice-President.I
consider it best, therefore, that the sittings of the Court should
be suspended until the return of the Dessave from the pearl fishery,
unless His Excellency the Governor and the Council should give other
instructions, which Your Honours would be bound to obey.I also found that no law books are kept at the Court, and it would
be well, therefore, if Your Honours applied to His Excellency the
Governor and the Council to provide you with such books as they deem
most useful, because only a minority of the members possess these
books privately, and, as a rule, the Company's servants are poor
lawyers.Justice may therefore be either too severely or too leniently
administered.There are also many native customs according to which
civil matters have to be settled, as the inhabitants would consider
themselves wronged if the European laws be applied to them, and it
would be the cause of disturbances in the country.As, however, a
knowledge of these matters cannot be obtained without careful study and
experience, which not every one will take the trouble to acquire, it
would be well if a concise digest be compiled according to information
supplied by the chiefs and most impartial natives.No one could have a
better opportunity to do this than the Dessave, and such a work might
serve for the instruction of the members of the Court of Justice as
well as for new rulers arriving here, for no one is born with this
knowledge.I am surprised that no one has as yet undertaken this work.Laurens Pyl in his Memoir of November 7, 1679,
with regard to the Court of Justice, namely, that the greatest
precautions must be used in dealing with this false, cunning, and
deceitful race, who think little of taking a false oath when they see
any advantage for themselves in doing so, must be followed.This is
perhaps the reason that the Mudaliyars Don Philip Willewaderayen and
Don Anthony Naryna were ordered in a letter from Colombo of March 22,
1696, to take their oath at the request of the said Mudaly Tamby
only in the heathen fashion, although this seemed out of keeping
with the principles of the Christian religion (Salva Reverentio),
as these people are recognized as baptized Christians, and therefore
the taking of this oath is not practised here.The natives are also
known to be very malicious and contentious among themselves, and do
not hesitate to bring false charges against each other, sometimes for
the sole purpose of being able to say that they gained a triumph over
their opponents before the Court of Justice.They are so obstinate
in their pretended rights that they will revive cases which had been
decided during the time of the Portuguese, and insist on these being
dealt with again.I have been informed that some rules have been laid
down with regard to such cases by other Commandeurs some 6, 8, 10,
and 20 years previous, which it would be well to look up with a view
to restrain these people.They also always revive cases decided by
the Commandeurs or Dessaves whenever these are succeeded by others,
and for this reason I never consented to alter any decision by a former
Commandeur, as the party not satisfied can always appeal to the higher
court at Colombo.His Excellency the Governor and the Council desired
very properly in their letter of November 15, 1694, that no processes
decided civilly by a Commandeur as regent should be brought in appeal
before the Court of Justice here, because the same Commandeur acts in
that College as President.Such cases must therefore be referred to
Colombo, which is the proper course.Care must also be taken that all
documents concerning each case are preserved, registered, and submitted
by the Secretary.I say this because I found that this was shamefully
neglected during my residence here in the years 1691 and 1692, when
several cases had been decided and sentences pronounced, of which not
a single document was preserved, still less the notes or copies made.Another matter to be observed is that contained in the Resolutions
of the Council of India of June 14, 1694, where the amounts paid to
the soldiers and sailors are ordered not to exceed the balance due
to them above what is paid for them monthly in the Fatherland.I
also noticed that at present 6 Lascoreens and 7 Caffirs are paid
as being employed by the Fiscaal, while formerly during the time
of the late Fiscaal Joan de Ridder, who was of the rank of Koopman,
not more than 5 Lascoreens and 6 Caffirs were ever paid for.I do not
know why the number has been increased, and this greater expense is
imposed upon the Company.No more than the former number are to be
employed in future.This number has sufficed for so many years under
the former Fiscaal, and as the Fiscaal has no authority to arrest any
natives without the knowledge of the Commandeur or the Dessave, it
will still suffice.It was during the time of the late Onderkoopman
Lengele, when the word "independent" carried much weight, that the
staff of native servants was increased, although for the service of
the whole College of the Political Council not more than 4 Lascoreens
are employed, although its duties are far more numerous than those of
the Fiscaal.I consider that the number of native servants should be
limited to that strictly necessary, so that it may not be said that
they are kept for show or for private purposes.[35]

The Company has endeavoured at great expense, from the time it took
possession of this Island, to introduce the religion of the True
Reformed Christian Church among this perverse nation.For this purpose
there have been maintained during the last 38 years 35 churches and
3 or 4 clergymen, but how far this has been accepted by the people
of Jaffnapatam I will leave for my successors to judge, rather than
express my opinion on the subject here.It is a well-known fact that
in the year 1693 nearly all the churches in this part of the country
were found stocked with heathen books, besides the catechisms and
Christian prayer books.It is remarkable that this should have
occurred after His late Excellency Governor van Mydregt in 1689
had caused all Roman Catholic churches and secret convents to be
dismantled and abolished, and instead of them founded a Seminary or
Training School for the propagation of the true religion, incurring
great expenses for this purpose.I heard only lately that, while I
was in Colombo and the Dessave in Negapatam, a certain Lascoreen,
with the knowledge of the schoolmasters of the church in Warrany, had
been teaching the children the most wicked fables one could think of,
and that these schoolmasters had been summoned before the Court of
Justice here and caned and the books burnt.But on my return I found
to my surprise that these schoolmasters had not been dismissed, and
that neither at the Political Council nor at the Court of Justice
had any notes been made of this occurrence, and still less a record
made as to how the case had been decided.The masters were therefore
on my orders summoned again before the meeting of the Scholarchen,
by which they were suspended until such time as the Lascoreen should
be arrested.I have not succeeded in laying hands on this Lascoreen,
but Your Honours must make every endeavour, after my departure, to
trace him out; because he may perhaps imagine that the matter has
been forgotten.Such occurrences as these are not new in Warrany;
because the idolatry committed there in 1679 will be known to some
of you.On that occasion the authors were arrested by the Company
through the assistance of the Brahmin Timmersa Nayk, notwithstanding he
himself was a heathen, as may be seen from the public acknowledgment
granted to him by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, November 7, 1679.I
therefore think that the Wannias are at the bottom of all this
idolatry, not only because they have alliances with the Bellales all
over the country, but especially because their adherents are to be
found in Warrany and also in the whole Province of Patchelepalle,
where half the inhabitants are dependent on them.This was seen at
the time the Wannias marched about here in Jaffnapatam in triumph,
and almost posed as rulers here.We may be assured that they are
the greatest devil-worshippers that could be found, for they have
never yet admitted a European into their houses, for fear of their
idolatry being discovered, while for the sake of appearance they
allow themselves to be married and baptized by our ministers.For instance, it is a well-known fact that Don Philip Nellamapane
applied to His late Excellency van Mydregt that one of his sons might
be admitted into the Seminary, with a view of getting into his good
graces; while no sooner had His Excellency left this than the son
was recalled under some false pretext.In 1696, when this boy was in
Negapatam with the Dessave de Bitter, he was caught making offerings
in the temples, wearing disguise at the time.It could not be expected
that such a boy, of no more than ten or twelve years old, should do
this if he had not been taught or ordered by his parents to do so
or had seen them doing the same, especially as he was being taught
another religion in the Seminary.I could relate many such instances,
but as this is not the place to do so, this may serve as an example
to put you on your guard.It is only known to God, who searches the
hearts and minds of men, what the reason is that our religion is not
more readily accepted by this nation: whether it is because the time
for their conversion has not yet arrived, or whether for any other
reason, I will leave to the Omniscient Lord.You might read what has
been written by His Excellency van Mydregt in his proposal to the
reverend brethren the clergy and the Consistory here on January 11,
1690, with regard to the promotion of religion and the building of
a Seminary.I could refer to many other documents bearing on this
subject, but I will only quote here the lessons contained in the
Instructions of the late Commandeur Paviljoen of December 19, 1665,
where he urges that the reverend brethren the clergy must be upheld and
supported by the Political Council in the performance of their august
duties, and that they must be provided with all necessary comforts;
so that they may not lose their zeal, but may carry out their work
with pleasure and diligence.On the other hand care must be taken
that no infringement of the jurisdiction of the Political Council
takes place, and on this subject it would be well for Your Honours
to read the last letter from Batavia of July 3,1696, with regard to
the words Sjuttan Peria Padrie and other such matters concerning the
Political Council as well as the clergy.(36)

With regard to the Seminary or training school for native children
founded in the year 1690 by His late Excellency van Mydregt, as another
evidence of the anxiety of the Company to propagate the True and Holy
Gospel among this blind nation for the salvation of their souls,
I will state here chiefly that Your Honours may follow the rules
and regulations compiled by His Excellency, as also those sent to
Jaffnapatam on the 16th of the same month.Twice a year the pupils
must be examined in the presence of the Scholarchen (those of the
Seminary as well as of the other churches) and of the clergy and the
rector.In this college the Commandeur is to act as President, but, as
I am to depart to Mallabaar, this office must be filled by the Dessave,
in compliance with the orders contained in the letters from Colombo
of April 4, 1696.The reports of these examinations must be entered
in the minute book kept by the Scriba, Jan de Crouse.These minutes
must be signed by the President and the other curators, while Your
Honours will be able to give further instructions and directions as
to how they are to be kept.During my absence the examination must be
held in the presence of the Dessave, and the Administrateur Michiels
Biermans and the Thombo-keeper Pieter Bolscho as Scholarchen of the
Seminary, the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and the Onderkoopman Joan Roos
as Scholarchen of the native churches, the reverend Adrianus Henricus
de Mey, acting Rector, and three other clergymen.It must be remembered, however, that this is only with regard to
examinations and not with regard to the framing of resolutions, which
so far has been left to the two Scholarchen and the President of the
Seminary.These, as special curators and directors, have received
higher authority from His Excellency the Governor and the Council,
with the understanding, however, that they observe the rules given
by His Excellency and the Council both with regard to the rector and
the children, in their letters of April 4 and June 13, 1696, and the
Resolutions framed by the curators of June 27 and October 21, 1695,
which were approved in Colombo.Whereas the school had been so far
maintained out of a fund set apart for this purpose, in compliance
with the orders of His Excellency, special accounts being kept of
the expenditure, it has now pleased the Council of India to decide
by Resolution of October 4, 1694, that only the cost of erection
of this magnificent building, which amounted to Rds.5,274, should
be paid out of the said fund.This debt having been paid, orders
were received in a letter from Their Excellencies of June 3, 1696,
that the institution is to be maintained out of the Company's funds,
special accounts of the expenditure being kept and sent yearly, both
to the Fatherland and to Batavia.At the closing of the accounts
last August the accounts of the Seminary as well as the amount due
to it were transferred to the Company's accounts.17,141, made up as follows:--


    Rds.10,341 entered at the Chief Counting-house in Colombo.1,200 cash paid by the Treasurer of the Seminary into the
                Company's Treasury, December 1, 1696.The latter was on December 1, 1690, on the foundation of the Seminary,
granted to that institution, and must now again, as before, be
placed by the Cashier on interest and a special account kept thereof;
because out of this fund the repairs to the churches and schools and
the expenses incurred in the visits of the clergy and the Scholarchen
have to be paid.Other items of revenue which had been appropriated
for the foundation of the Seminary, such as the farming out of
the fishery, &c., must be entered again in the Company's accounts,
as well as the revenue derived from the sale of lands, and that of
the two elephants allowed yearly to the Seminary.The fines levied
occasionally by the Dessave on the natives for offences committed
must be entered in the accounts of the Deaconate or of that of the
church fines, for whichever purpose they are most required.The Sicos [43] money must again be expended in the fortifications,
as it used to be done before the building of the Training School.The
income of the Seminary consisted of these six items, besides the
interest paid on the capital.This, I think, is all I need say on
the subject for Your Honours' information.I will only add that I
hope and pray that the Lord may more and more bless this Christian
design and the religious zeal of the Company.(37)

The Scholarchen Commission is a college of civil and ecclesiastical
officers, which for good reasons was introduced into this part of
the country from the very beginning of our rule.Their meetings are
usually held on the first Tuesday of every month, and at these is
decided what is necessary to be done for the advantage of the church,
such as the discharge and appointment of schoolmasters and merinhos,
[44] &c. It is here also that the periodical visits of the brethren of
the clergy to the different parishes are arranged.The applications of
natives who wish to enter into matrimony are also addressed to this
college.All the decisions are entered monthly in the resolutions,
which are submitted to the Political Council.This is done as I had
an idea that things were not as they ought to be with regard to the
visitation of churches and inspection of schools, and that the rules
made to that effect had come to be disregarded.This was a bad example,
and it may be seen from the Scholarchial Resolution Book of 1695 and
of the beginning of 1696, what difficulty I had in reintroducing these
rules.I succeeded at last so far in this matter that the visits of
the brethren of the clergy were properly divided and the time for them
appointed.This may be seen from the replies of the Political Council
to the Scholarchial Resolutions of January 14 and February 2, 1696.On my return from Ceylon I found inserted in the Scholarchial
Resolution Book a petition from two of the clergymen which had been
clandestinely sent to Colombo, in which they did not hesitate to
complain of the orders issued with regard to the visits referred to,
and, although these orders had been approved by His Excellency the
Governor and the Council, as stated above, the request made in this
clandestine petition was granted on March 6, 1696, and the petition
returned to Jaffnapatam with a letter signed on behalf of the Company
on March 14 following.It is true I also found an order from Colombo,
bearing date April 4 following, to the effect that no petitions should
be sent in future except through the Government here, which is in
accordance with the rules observed all over India, but the letter
from Colombo of November 17, received here, and the letter sent from
here to Colombo on December 12, prove that the rule was disregarded
almost as soon as it was made.On this account I could not reply
to the resolutions of the Scholarchen, as the petition, contrary to
those rules, was inserted among them.I think that the respect due
to a ruler in the service of the Company should not be sacrificed to
the private opposition of persons who consider that the orders issued
are to their disadvantage, and who rely on the success of private
petitions sent clandestinely which are publicly granted.In order not
to expose myself to such an indignity for the second time I left the
resolutions unanswered, and it will be necessary for Your Honours to
call a meeting of the Political Council to consider these resolutions,
to prevent the work among the natives being neglected.The College
of the Scholarchen consists at present of the following persons:--


The Dessave de Bitter, President.The Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, Scholarch.The Onderkoopman P. Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos, Scholarch.Adrianus Henricus de Mey, Clergyman.Philippus de Vriest, Clergyman.Thomas van Symey, Clergyman.I am obliged to mention here also for Your Honours' information that I
have noticed that the brethren of the clergy, after having succeeded
by means of their petition to get the visits arranged according to
their wish, usually apply for assistance, such as attendants, coolies,
cayoppen, &c., as soon as the time for their visits arrive, that is to
say, when it is their turn to go to such places as have the reputation
of furnishing good mutton, fowls, butter, &c.; but when they have to
visit the poorer districts, such as Patchelepalle, the boundaries of
the Wanny, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, they seldom give notice of the
arrival of the time, and some even go to the length of refusing to go
until they are commanded to depart.From this an idea may be formed of
the nature of their love for the work of propagating religion.Some
also take their wives with them on their visits of inspection to
the churches and schools, which is certainly not right as regards
the natives, because they have to bear the expense.With regard to
the regulations concerning the churches and schools, I think these
