The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?In the midst of
this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity
of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the
Okons, was the high and mighty ruler.The Okons and the followers of
the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the
paleface.Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an
immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic
words: "For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith," Verily the prophecy of the
dusky maiden had been fulfilled.The paleface had become impregnably
intrenched.The Okons could never be dislodged.With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,
the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more
seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.*       *       *       *       *

When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in
one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern
part of Pennsylvania.It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that
locality.The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known
to-day.Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments
possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up
to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War
to-day.It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to
acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under
the peculiar conditions existing at that period.A school district
that was able to support a school for six months in each year was
indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were
not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services
were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in
those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better
class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a
geography or grammar, but they were regarded as "stuck up," and the
other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far
beyond their capacity.Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December
and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart
each week for a spelling-match and recitation.We had our spelling
match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with
schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest.I was
considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling
matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great
four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to
one of the great contests.One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country
crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to
participate.As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle
the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride
without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to
the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal.While
the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to
starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet
as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination.I had not
considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance.As
soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers
were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them
was from our school.I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place
and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers.When
they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the
fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless.The school-master
from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from
his seat and said:

"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our
school."My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the
foot of the column.I felt very grateful towards our master for his
compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the
line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct.The
school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,
and I inwardly rejoiced.After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had
fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word
"phthisic."My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's
lips.It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling
book.It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to
make way for the exercises to follow.As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I
felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.said the school-master, and my pulse beat
faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to
their seats.As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said "Next," I
could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly
spell the word.With a clear and
distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room
I spelled out "ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.""Correct," said the
school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he
laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:
"I told you he could spell."I had spelled down four schools, and my
reputation as a speller was established.Our school was declared to
have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever
after my name was not the last one to be called.On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the
composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth
anniversary of his connection with the paper.A dozen of the old
employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr.Moore at an informal
dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event.Moore's service
on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer
Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which
eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press.He has held his
present position as the head of the composing room for about forty
years.Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St.Paul from Tioga
county, Pa., where he was born.He came with his brother, George W.
Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian.His
brother had been East and brought the boy West with him.Moore's
first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St.There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his
brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a
printer's "devil."It is interesting in these days of water works and
telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the
office.He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now
stands.Another of his jobs was to meet the boats.Whenever a steamer
whistled Mr.Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the
boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office.It was from these
papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world.He also
was half the carrier staff of the paper.His territory covered all
the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill
was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh
street.When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr.Moore went with
it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr.His service has been continuous,
excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war.The
Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest.Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more
notable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that
to-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as
efficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man
when things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the
beginning.Successive managements found that his services always gave
full value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and
devotion to the interests of the paper.Successive generations of
employes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure
to have as a fellow workman."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?So in Virginia's presence she became more trivial and petty
than ever.It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join
Company A. Few young men of family did not.And now he ran to his room
to don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high
bearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and
the gorgeous, priceless shackle.He
held his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high
resolve there was no mistaking.The high color of her pride was on the
cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his
mistress.And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses
awaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless
determination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her
in the summer house at Glencoe.Strive as she might against the thought,
deny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the
face of the North.Her patriotism and all that was in her of race
rebelled.To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and
Clarence's.Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried
out aloud that it was not inflexible.And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the
prairie, the memory of this was bitter within her."Did you rent our house at Glencoe?"Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent,
even to save Mr.The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise.She was leaning
back on the seat, her eyes half closed."Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it.I always had
a fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than
ever before.It was I who insulted them by naming that rent."'Colonel Carvel,' said he,
'I hear you wish to rent your house.''You rented it once
before, sir,' said he.'May I ask you what price you got
for it?'"I told him," said the Colonel, smiling."But I explained that I could
not expect to command that price now on short notice.He replied that
they would pay it, or not consider the place."Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case
last winter, and since then has had some practice.I believe he declined some sort of an editorial
position, preferring to remain at the law.""And so they are going into the house?""Whipple refused point-blank to go to the
country.He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life
likely to be worth anything.CHAPTER X. RICHTER'S SCAR

This was the summer when Mr.Stephen Brice began to make his appearance
in public.The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise,
although they were not all so.It was at a little town on the outskirts
of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to
listen.In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of
advice which Mr."Speak so that the lowest may
understand, and the rest will have no trouble."At
the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately
wide of the mark.After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his
audience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in
the rear, out of sight of the stand.This may have been Judge Whipple,
although we have no proof of the fact.Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech.He
laughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it
was.I have no doubt that many of the master's phrases slipped in, as
young Mr.Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union
speech by heart.He had caught more than the phrasing, however.So
imbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught
it; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages.The event
is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to
ask questions.For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition.Wasn't it
true, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the <DW64> from his master,
give him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man
that owned him?"Slavery may stay where it is," cried the young orator."If it is content there, so are we content.What we say is that it shall
not go one step farther.No, not one inch into a northern territory."Brice was one of the orators at a much larger
meeting in a garden in South St.And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr.Brice was able to
trace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic
wars to its Revolution.Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated
to this great and free country.And when in an inspired moment he
coupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of
the trees above them trembled at their cheers.And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove
with Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena.There was
Herr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly;
and Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and
ponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache
that pointed upward.They clattered their steins on the table and sang
wonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried
off to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with
its towers and crooked streets.And when they sang the Trolksmelodie,
"Bemooster Bursche zieh' ich aus,--Ade!"a big tear rolled down the scar
on Richter's cheek."Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm
        Ich zieh' nicht mehr in euch herum,
        Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,
        Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang."As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness
of that farewell song.It was Richter who brought the full force of it
home to Stephen."Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my
friend?"He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even
to his mother.And here was the difference between the Saxon and the
Anglo-Saxon.Richter smoked his pipe'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his
face."Tiefel and I were at the University together," he said at length."He
remembers the day I left Jena for good and all.Ah, Stephen, that is
the most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland.We
dine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy
little tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us.We swear for
the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for
the Fatherland, if God so wills.And then we march at the head of a slow
procession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first,
then the fox major and the foxes.""The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them," answered Richter,
smiling."And after the foxes," said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, "after the
foxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four.And so we go
slowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many
a schlager-bout with the aristocrats.And the president of our society
makes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all
the honors.And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!"And Herr
Tiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air,
shouting:

"Lebe wohl, Carl!Salamander, salamander, salamander!Ein ist
ein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei!And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they
complimented on his speech.And he soon learned to cry Salamander,
and to rub his mug on the table, German fashion.He was not long in
discovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his
companions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South
St.In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom
Stephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a
United States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in
the singing.But presently he carried Richter away with him."What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!""I think he was the best man with the Schlager
that Jena ever saw.Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask
and fencing hat, all padded.Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent."I have still a welt that he gave me a month since," he said."He has
left his mark on many an aristocrat.""And why did you always fight the aristocrats?"They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed."Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend," he
cried."Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor.Because the
most of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be
by morality and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued.And
so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs.We swore to live by the
standards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke.We swore to strive for
the freedom of Germany with manly courage.And when we were not duelling
with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.""Ja wohl," answered Korner, puffing heavily.The slit in his nose was
plain even in the moonlight."To keep our hands in, as you would say.You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager.But we fought
that we might not become effete."It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long
burning within him.Korner," said he, "how did Richter come by that scar?He
always gets red when I mention it."Ah, I can well believe that," answered Korner."I will recount that
matter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund.Brice," Herr Korner continued, "has never heard of the Count von
Kalbach.We at Jena had, and all Germany.Many of us of
the Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager.Von
Kalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was
worshipped.When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather
to look at them.exclaimed
Herr Korner, "there is something in blood, when all is said.He was as
straight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a
poplar.It is so with the Pomeranians."It was in the year '47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin
before his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von
Kalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion.He
boasted openly that day that none of the despised 'Burschenschaft' dare
stand before him.Before night
all Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena
'Burschenschaft'.To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl
likewise feared for him."Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at
Jena, since killed in the Breite Strasse.And if you will believe me,
my friend.I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak
smoking his pipe.The place was filled, the nobles on one side and
the Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees.Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon.He would
not have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the
neck covering--Nothing!So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap,
and his apron with the device of the Germanians."There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue.And
when it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly
smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon
all.At the sight of the pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf,
and when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast.You,
my friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot
know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade.It was music
that morning: You should have seen the noble's mighty strokes--'Prim und
Second und Terz und Quart'.You would have marked how Richter met him
at every blow.Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke
from the bowl.He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think
how we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was
driven back a step, and then another.You must know that it is a lasting
disgrace to be forced over one's own line.It seemed as if we could not
bear the agony.And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the
half, came a snap like that of a whip's lash, and the bowl of Richter's
pipe lay smouldering on the grass.The noble had cut the stem as clean
as it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still
clenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood.He
pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles.The Count
was smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around
him, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second
mensur,--though the wound was three needles long.Then Kalbach cried
aloud that he would kill him.Something
was in them that made us think as we washed the cut.But when we spoke
to him he said nothing.Nor could we force the pipe stems from his
teeth.exclaimed Herr Korner, but reverently, "if I live to a
hundred I never hope to see such a sight as that 'Mensur'.The Schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard
the ring alone.Before we of the Burschenschaft knew what had happened
the Count von Kalbach was over his line and had flung his Schlager into
a great tree, and was striding from the place with his head hung and the
tears streamin down his face."Amid a silence, Herr Korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly.A wind was rising, bearing with it song and laughter from distant
groups,--Teutonic song and, laughter.The moonlight trembled through the
shifting leaves.And Stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous.It was as if this fierce duel, so full of national significance to a
German, had been fought in another existence, It was incredible to him
that the unassuming lawyer he knew, so wholly Americanized, had been the
hero of it.Strange, indeed, that the striving life of these leaders of
European Revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor.There
came to Stephen a flash of that world-comprehension which marks great
statesmen.Was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force
of patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the
nations, that its high mission might be fulfilled?She and her brothers and Jack
Brinsmade used to banter him when he came a-visiting in Bellefontaine
Road.The time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon
neighbor, when friends of long standing passed each other with averted
looks.It was not even a wild dream that white-trash Lincoln would be
elected.Jack, who made speeches for Breckenridge in the face
of Mr.Brinsmade's Union leanings, laughed at Stephen when he came to
spend the night.He joined forces with Puss in making clever fun of the
booby Dutch, which Stephen was wise enough to take good-naturedly.But
once or twice when he met Clarence Colfax at these houses he was aware
of a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman.This
troubled him more than he cared to admit.For he liked Clarence, who
reminded him of Virginia--at once a pleasure and a pain.It is no harm to admit (for the benefit of the Society for Psychical
Research) that Stephen still dreamed of her.He would go about his work
absently all the morning with the dream still in his head, and the girl
so vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in
England, as Miss Russell said.Puss and Anne were careful to keep him
informed as to her whereabouts.Stephen set this down as a most natural
supposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in
Virginia Carvel.How needless to add that Virginia in her correspondence never mentioned
Stephen, although Puss in her letters took pains to record the fact
every time that he addressed a Black Republican meeting: Miss Carvel
paid no attention to this part of the communications.Her concern for
Judge Whipple Virginia did not hide.How he stood the
rigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike.HOW A PRINCE CAME

Who has not heard of the St.And what memories
of its October days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew
that hallowed place as children.There was the vast wooden amphitheatre
where mad trotting races were run; where stolid cattle walked past the
Chinese pagoda in the middle circle, and shook the blue ribbons on their
horns.But it was underneath the tiers of seats (the whole way around
the ring) that the chief attractions lay hid.These were the church
booths, where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and
ice-cream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity.These ladies
wore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers.And toward the
close of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted.Thayer's,
Unitarian, where Mrs.Davitt's, conducted
by Mr.Eliphalet Hopper on strictly business principles, and the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, where Miss Renault and other young ladies of French
descent presided: and Dr.Posthelwaite's, Presbyterian, which we shall
come to presently.And others, the whole way around the ring.Louisans still delight to recall,--that
of the autumn of 1860--Think for a minute.You will remember that
Virginia Carvel came back from Europe; and made quite a stir in a
town where all who were worth knowing were intimates.Stephen caught a
glimpse of her an the street, received a distant bow, and dreamed of her
that night.Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday suit, was at the ferry
to pay his respects to the Colonel, to offer his services, and to
tell him how the business fared.Louis face that
Virginia saw (Captain Lige being in New Orleans), and if she conversed
with Eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before, there is
nothing strange in that.Hopper rode home with them in the carriage,
and walked to Miss Crane's with his heart thumping against his breast,
and wild thoughts whirling in his head.The next morning, in Virginia's sunny front room tears and laughter
mingled.There was a present for Eugenie and Anne and Emily and Puss
and Maude, and a hear kiss from the Colonel for each.And more tears
and laughter and sighs as Mammy Easter and Rosetta unpacked the English
trunks, and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each Parisian
gown upon the bed.At the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me.Why mention the
dread possibility of the <DW64>-worshiper Lincoln being elected the
very next month?Why listen, to the rumblings in the South?Pompeii had
chariot-races to the mutterings of Vesuvius.Louis was in gala garb
to greet a Prince.That was the year that Miss Virginia Carvel was given charge of the
booth in Dr.Posthelwaite's church,--the booth next one of the great
arches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came.Now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with Miss Jinny?Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?Who slipped into her hand
the contribution for the church, and refused to take the cream candy she
laughingly offered him as an equivalent?None other than Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Duke of Saxony, Duke of
Cornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron Renfrew, and
Lord of the Isles.Out of compliment to the Republic which he visited,
he bore the simple title of Lord Renfrew.Bitter tears of envy, so it was said, were shed in the other booths.Belle Cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed.Eliphalet Hopper,
in Mr.Davitt's booths, stared until his eyes watered.A great throng
peered into the covered way, kept clear for his Royal Highness and
suite, and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them.And when
the Prince was seen to turn to His Grace, the Duke of Newcastle, and the
subscription was forthcoming, a great cheer shook the building, while
Virginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled.Colonel Carvel, who was a Director, laid his hand paternally on the
blue coat of the young Prince.Reversing all precedent, he presented
his Royal Highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies.It was
done with the easy grace of a Southern gentleman.Sandra travelled to the hallway.Whereupon Lord Renfrew
bowed and smiled too, and stroked his mustache, which was a habit he
had, and so fell naturally into the ways of Democracy.Miss Puss Russell, who has another name, and whose hair is now white,
will tell you how Virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her
country.It is safe to say that the Prince forgot "Silver Heels" and "Royal Oak,"
although they had been trotted past the Pagoda only that morning for his
delectation.He had forgotten his Honor the Mayor, who had held fast to
the young man's arm as the four coal-black horses had pranced through
the crowds all the way from Barnum's Hotel to the Fair Grounds.His
Royal Highness forgot himself still further, and had at length withdrawn
his hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs
into his yellow waistcoat.And who shall blame him if Miss Virginia's
replies to his sallies enchained him?Not the least impressive of those who stood by, smiling, was the figure
of the tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written on his
face.Oh, that his dear wife might have lived to see this!What was said in that historic interview with a future Sovereign of
England, far from his royal palaces, on Democratic sawdust, with an
American Beauty across a board counter, was immediately recorded by the
Colonel, together with an exact description of his Royal Highness's blue
coat, and light, flowing pantaloons, and yellow waist-coat, and 
kids; even the Prince's habit of stroking his mustache did not escape
the watchful eye.It is said that his Grace of Newcastle smiled twice at
Miss Virginia's retorts, and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, has more
than two to his credit.Miss
Virginia in the very midst of a sentence paused, and then stopped.Her
eyes had strayed from the Royal Countenance, and were fixed upon a
point in the row of heads outside the promenade.Her sentence was
completed--with some confusion.Perhaps it is no wonder that my Lord
Renfrew, whose intuitions are quick, remarked that he had already
remained too long, thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise
should have had.This was a graceful speech, and a kingly.Followed by
his retinue and the prominent citizens, he moved on.And it was remarked
by keen observers that his Honor the Mayor had taken hold once more of
the Prince's elbow, who divided his talk with Colonel Carver.What a true American of the old type you were.You,
nor the Mayor, nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not
blinded by the light of a royal Presence.You saw in him only an amiable
and lovable young man, who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable
of sovereigns, Victoria.You, Colonel Carvel, were not one to cringe to
royalty.Out of respect for the just and lenient Sovereign, his mother,
you did honor to the Prince.But you did not remind him, as you might
have, that your ancestors fought for the King at Marston Moor, and that
your grandfather was once an intimate of Charles James Fox.Cluyme, and of a few others whose wealth alone
enabled them to be Directors of the Fair?Miss Isabel Cluyme was duly
presented, in proper form, to his Royal Highness.Her father owned a
"peerage," and had been abroad likewise.He made no such bull as the
Colonel.And while the celebrated conversation of which we have spoken
was in progress, Mr.Cluyme stood back and blushed for his countryman,
and smiled apologetically at the few gentlemen of the royal suite who
glanced his way.His Royal Highness then proceeded to luncheon, which is described by a
most amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account
of it that I cannot forbear to copy.You may believe what he says, or
not, just as you choose: "So interested was his Royal Highness in the
proceedings that he stayed in the ring three and a half hours witnessing
these trotting matches.He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden
shanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but
whether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell.After much trouble
he forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of
ravenous animals.And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices
of beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of
lager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into
thin shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar.There were neither salt spoons
nor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in
their stead; and, by the aid of nature's forks, the slices of beef and
mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat.While
your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle
came in, and he sat looking too.He was evidently trying to look
democratic, but could not manage it.By his side stood a man urging him
to try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose.Henceforth, let the
New York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and
bad sherry rest in peace."Even that great man whose memory we love and revere, Charles Dickens,
was not overkind to us, and saw our faults rather than our virtues.We
were a nation of grasshoppers, and spat tobacco from early morning until
late at night.This some of us undoubtedly did, to our shame be it
said.Dickens went down the Ohio, early in the '40's, he
complained of the men and women he met; who, bent with care, bolted
through silent meals, and retired within their cabins.Dickens
saw our ancestors bowed in a task that had been too great for other
blood,--the task of bringing into civilization in the compass of a
century a wilderness three thousand miles it breadth.And when his Royal
Highness came to St.Louis and beheld one hundred thousand people at the
Fair, we are sure that he knew how recently the ground he stood upon had
been conquered from the forest.For, while the Prince lingered
in front of the booth of Dr.Posthelwaite's church and chatted with
Virginia, a crowd had gathered without.They stood peering over the
barricade into the covered way, proud of the self-possession of their
young countrywoman.And here, by a twist of fate, Mr.Stephen Brice
found himself perched on a barrel beside his friend Richter.It was
Richter who discovered her first.It is Miss Carvel herself, Stephen," he cried, impatient at the
impassive face of his companion."Yes," said Stephen, "I see."exclaimed the disgusted German, "will nothing move you?I have
seen German princesses that are peasant women beside her.Stephen saw, and horror held him in a tremor.What if she should raise her eyes, and amid those vulgar stares
discern his own?And yet that was within him which told him that she
would look up.It was only a question of moments, and then,--and then
she would in truth despise him!Wedged tightly between the people, to
move was to be betrayed.Suddenly he rallied, ashamed of his own false shame.This was because
of one whom he had known for the short, space of a day--whom he was
to remember for a lifetime.The man he worshipped, and she detested.Abraham Lincoln would not have blushed between honest clerks and farmers
Why should Stephen Brice?And what, after all, was this girl to him?Almost the first day he had come to St.Louis the wires
of their lives had crossed, and since then had crossed many times again,
always with a spark.By the might of generations she was one thing, and
he another.They were separated by a vast and ever-widening breach only
to be closed by the blood and bodies of a million of their countrymen.Gradually, charmed like the simple people about him, Stephen became lost
in the fascination of the scene.Suddenly confronted at a booth in a
public fair with the heir to the English throne, who but one of her own
kind might have carried it off so well, have been so complete a mistress
of herself?Since, save for a heightened color, Virginia gave no sign of
excitement.Undismayed, forgetful of the admiring crowd, unconscious of
their stares until--until the very strength of his gaze had compelled
her own.Nor did he wonder
because, in that multitude of faces, her eyes had flown so straightly
homeward to his.With a rough effort that made an angry stir, Stephen flung the people
aside and escaped, the astonished Richter following in his wake.Nor
could the honest German dissuade him from going back to the office for
the rest of the day, or discover what had happened.But all through the afternoon that scene was painted on the pages of
Stephen's books.The free pose
of the girl standing in front of her companions, a blue wisp of autumn
sunlight falling at her feet.The young Prince laughing at her sallies,
and the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair.INTO WHICH A POTENTATE COMES

Virginia danced with the Prince, "by Special Appointment," at the ball
that evening.So likewise was Miss
Belle Cluyme among those honored and approved.But Virginia wore the
most beautiful of her Paris gowns, and seemed a princess to one watching
from the gallery.Stephen was sure that his Royal Highness made that
particular dance longer than the others.It was decidedly longer than
the one he had with Miss Cluyme, although that young lady had declared
she was in heaven.Alas, that princes cannot abide with us forever!His Royal Highness bade
farewell to St.Louis, and presently that same 'City of Alton' which
bore him northward came back again in like royal state, and this time it
was in honor of a Democrat potentate.He is an old friend now, Senator
and Judge and Presidential Candidate,--Stephen Arnold Douglas,--father
of the doctrine of Local Sovereignty, which he has come to preach.We are no sooner rid of one hero than we are ready for
another.Blow, you bandsmen on the hurricane deck, let the shores echo with your
national airs!Let the gay bunting wave in the river breeze!Uniforms
flash upon the guards, for no campaign is complete without the military.Here are brave companies of the Douglas Guards, the Hickory Sprouts, and
the Little Giants to do honor to the person of their hero.Cannon are
booming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee,
where the piles of river freight are covered with people.Transparencies
are dodging in the darkness.A fresh band strikes up "Hail Columbia,"
and the four horses prance away, followed closely by the "Independent
Broom Rangers.""The shouts for Douglas," remarked a keen observer who
was present, "must have penetrated Abraham's bosom at Springfield."Jacob Cluyme, who had been a Bell and Everett man until that day,
was not the only person of prominence converted.After the speech he
assured the Judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of
his life in meeting the popular orator, the true representative man of
the Great West, the matured statesman, and the able advocate of national
principles.Douglas looked as if he had heard something
of the kind before, he pressed Mr.So was the author of Popular Sovereignty, "the great Bulwark of American
Independence," escorted to the Court House steps, past houses of his
stanch supporters; which were illuminated in his honor.Stephen,
wedged among the people, remarked that the Judge had lost none of his
self-confidence since that day at Freeport.Who, seeing the Democratic
candidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide
square, would guess that the Question troubled him at all, or that he
missed the votes of the solid South?How gravely the Judge listened to
the eulogy of the prominent citizen, who reminded him that his work was
not yet finished, and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the
people!And how happy was the choice of that word harnessed!The Judge had heard (so he said) with deep emotion the remarks of the
chairman.Then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a
spell about those who listened,--which, like the most popular of novels,
moved to laughter and to tears, to anger and to pity.Brice and
Mr Richter were not the only Black Republicans who were depressed that
night.And they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing
in their ears, heavy with the thought that the long, hot campaign of
their own Wide-Awakes might be in vain.They had a grim reproof from Judge Whipple in the morning."So you too, gentlemen, took opium last night," was all he said.Lincoln's election did not interfere with
the gayeties.Clarence Colfax gave a great
dance at Bellegarde, in honor of his cousin, Virginia, to which Mr.Virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform.It was at this time that Anne Brinsmade took the notion of having a ball
in costume.Virginia, on hearing the news, rode over from Bellegarde,
and flinging her reins to Nicodemus ran up to Anne's little
dressing-room.Anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance, but there was one
name she omitted.asked Virginia, searchingly, when she
had finished."I have invited Stephen Brice, Jinny," she said.Am I to be confronted with that
Yankee everywhere I go?It is always 'Stephen Brice', and he is ushered
in with a but."She had dignity, however, and
plenty of it."You have no right to criticise my guests, Virginia."Virginia, seated on the arm of a chair, tapped her foot on the floor."Why couldn't things remain as they were?""We were so happy
before these Yankees came.And they are not content in trying to deprive
us of our rights."Stephen Brice is a gentleman," answered Anne."He spoils no one's
pleasure, and goes no place that he is not asked.""He has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman, the few
times that I have been unfortunate enough to encounter him," Virginia
retorted."You are the only one who says so, then."Here the feminine got the
better of Anne's prudence, and she added."I saw you waltz with him
once, Jinny Carvel, and I am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in
your life.""You may have your ball, and your Yankees,
all of them you want.How I wish I had never seen
that horrid Stephen Brice!Virginia rose and snatched her riding-whip.She threw her arms around her friend without more ado."Don't quarrel with me, Jinny," she said tearfully.Brice is not coming, I am sure."And I was going on to
tell you that he could not come."She stopped, and stared at Virginia in bewilderment.That young lady,
instead of beaming, had turned her back.She stood flicking her whip at
the window, gazing out over the trees, down the <DW72> to the river."Because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night.Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny?We are much worried about him, because he has worked so hard this
summer."exclaimed Virginia, scornfully ignoring
the rest of what was said."Then I'll come, Anne dear," she cried,
tripping the length of the room.She cantered off down the drive and out of the gate, leaving a very
puzzled young woman watching her from the window.But when Virginia
reached the forest at the bend of the road, she pulled her horse down to
a walk.She bethought herself of the gown which her Uncle Daniel had sent her
from Calvert House, and of the pearls.And she determined to go as her
great-grandmother, Dorothy Carvel.How many readers will smile before the rest of this
true incident is told?Miss Anne Brinsmade had driven to town in
her mother's Jenny Lind a day or two before, and had stopped (as she
often did) to pay a call on Mrs.This lady, as may be guessed,
was not given to discussion of her husband's ancestors, nor of her
own.But on the walls of the little dining-room hung a Copley and two
Stuarts.One of the Stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff
and blue of the Continental Army.And it was this picture which caught
Anne's eye that day."Colonel Wilton Brice, Stephen's grandfather.There is a marked
look about all the Brices.He was only twenty years of age when the
Revolution began.That picture was painted much later in life, after
Stuart came back to America, when the Colonel was nearly forty.He had
kept his uniform, and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it.""If Stephen would only come as Colonel Wilton Brice!""Do you
think he would, Mrs."I am afraid not, Anne," she said."I have a part of the uniform
upstairs, but I could never induce him even to try it on."As she drove from shop to shop that day, Anne reflected that it
certainly would not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather's uniform to
a ball.But she meant to ask him, at any rate.And she had driven home
immediately to write her invitations.It was with keen disappointment
that she read his note of regret.However, on the very day of the ball, Anne chanced to be in town again,
and caught sight of Stephen pushing his way among the people on Fourth
Street.She waved her hand to him, and called to Nicodemus to pull up at
the sidewalk."We are all so sorry that you are not coming," said she, impulsively.For Anne was a sincere person, and
remembered Virginia."That is, I am so sorry," she added, a little
hastily."Stephen, I saw the portrait of your grandfather, and I wanted
you to come in his costume."Stephen, smiling down on her, said nothing.And poor Anne, in her fear
that he had perceived the shade in her meaning, made another unfortunate
remark."If you were not a--a Republican--" she said."A Black Republican," he answered, and laughed at her discomfiture."I only meant that if you were not a Republican, there would be no
meeting to address that night.""It does not make any difference to you what my politics are, does it?""Some people have discarded me," he said, striving to smile.She wondered whether he meant Virginia, and whether he cared.Still
further embarrassed, she said something which she regretted immediately."Couldn't you contrive to come?""I will come, after the meeting, if it is not too late," he said at
length.He lifted his hat, and hurried on, leaving Anne in a quandary.Virginia was coming on
the condition that he was not to be there.Stephen, too, was almost instantly sorry that he had promised.The
little costumer's shop (the only one in the city at that time) had been
ransacked for the occasion, and nothing was left to fit him.But when he
reached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mother's room.Colonel Brice's cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed, and
presently Hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the
kitchen, where she had been pressing them.Stephen must needs yield to
his mother's persuasions and try them on--they were more than a passable
fit.But there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of, and
the ruffled shirt and the powdered wig.So before tea he hurried down
to the costumer's again, not quite sure that he was not making a fool
of himself, and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the
thing.The coat was mended and freshened.And when after tea he dressed
in the character, his appearance was so striking that his mother could
not refrain from some little admiration.As for Hester, she was in
transports.But still the frivolity of
it all troubled him.He had inherited from Colonel Wilton Brice, the
Puritan, other things beside clothes.And he felt in his heart as he
walked soberly to the hall that this was no time for fancy dress balls.All intention of going was banished by the time his turn had come to
speak.Not caring to sit out the
meeting on the platform, he made his way down the side of the crowded
hall, and ran into (of all people) big Tom Catherwood.As the Southern
Rights politics of the Catherwood family were a matter of note in the
city, Stephen did not attempt to conceal his astonishment.He congratulated Stephen on his speech, and
volunteered the news that he had come in a spirit of fairness to hear
what the intelligent leaders of the Republican party, such as Judge
Whipple, had to say.But the sight of him
started in Stephen a train of thought that closed his ears for once
to the Judge's words.He had had before a huge liking for Tom.Now he
admired him, for it was no light courage that took one of his position
there.And Stephen remembered that Tom was not risking merely the
displeasure of his family and his friends, but likewise something of
greater value than, either.From childhood Tom had been the devoted
slave of Virginia Carvel, with as little chance of marrying her as a man
ever had.And now he was endangering even that little alliance.And so Stephen began to think of Virginia, and to wonder what she would
wear at Anne's party; and to speculate how she would have treated him if
had gone.To speak truth, this last matter had no little weight in his
decision to stay away.But we had best leave motives to those whose
business and equipment it is to weigh to a grain.Since that agonizing
moment when her eyes had met his own among the curiously vulgar at the
Fair, Stephen's fear of meeting Virginia had grown to the proportions of
a terror.And yet there she was in his mind, to take possession of it on
the slightest occasion.When Judge Whipple had finished, Tom rose."Stephen," said he, "of course you're going to the Brinsmade's.""Why, then, you've got to come with me," says Tom, heartily."It isn't
too late, and they'll want you.I've a buggy, and I'm going to the
Russells' to change my clothes.BRINSMADE'S GATE

The eastern side of the Brinsmade house is almost wholly taken up by the
big drawing-room where Anne gave her fancy-dress ball.From the windows
might be seen, through the trees in the grounds, the Father of Waters
below.But the room is gloomy now, that once was gay, and a heavy coat
of soot is spread on the porch at the back, where the apple blossoms
still fall thinly in the spring.The huge black town has coiled about
the place the garden still struggles on, but the giants of the forest
are dying and dead.Bellefontaine Road itself, once the drive of
fashion, is no more.Trucks and cars crowd the streets which follow its
once rural windings, and gone forever are those comely wooded hills and
green pastures,--save in the memory of those who have been spared to
dream.Still the old house stands, begrimed but stately, rebuking the sordid
life around it.Still come into it the Brinsmades to marriage and to
death.Calvin Brinsmade took his
bride there.They sat on the porch in the morning light, harking to
the whistle of the quail in the corn, and watching the frightened deer
scamper across the open.Do you see the bride in her high-waisted gown,
and Mr.Calvin in his stock and his blue tail-coat and brass buttons?Old people will tell you of the royal hospitality then, of the famous
men and women who promenaded under those chandeliers, and sat down to
the game-laden table.In 1835 General Atkinson and his officers thought
nothing of the twenty miles from Jefferson Barracks below, nor of
dancing all night with the Louisville belles, who were Mrs.Thither came Miss Todd of Kentucky, long before she thought
of taking for a husband that rude man of the people, Abraham Lincoln.Foreigners of distinction fell in love with the place, with its
open-hearted master and mistress, and wrote of it in their journals.Would that many of our countrymen, who think of the West as rough, might
have known the quality of the Brinsmades and their neighbors!An era of charity, of golden simplicity, was passing on that October
night of Anne Brinsmade's ball.Those who made merry there were soon
to be driven and scattered before the winds of war; to die at Wilson's
Creek, or Shiloh, or to be spared for heroes of the Wilderness.Some
were to eke out a life of widowhood in poverty.All were to live
soberly, chastened by what they had seen.A fear knocked at Colonel
Carvel's heart as he stood watching the bright figures."Brinsmade," he said, "do you remember this room in May, '46?"Brinsmade, startled, turned upon him quickly."Why, Colonel, you have read my very thoughts," he said."Some of those
who were here then are--are still in Mexico.""And some who came home, Brinsmade, blamed God because they had not
fallen," said the Colonel."Hush, Comyn, His will be done," he answered; "He has left a daughter to
comfort you."In her gown of faded primrose
and blue with its quaint stays and short sleeves, she seemed to have
caught the very air of the decorous century to which it belonged.She
was standing against one of the pilasters at the side of the
room, laughing demurely at the antics of Becky Sharp and Sir John
Falstaff,--Miss Puss Russell and Mr.Tennyson's "Idylls" having appeared but the year before, Anne was
dressed as Elaine, a part which suited her very well.It was strange
indeed to see her waltzing with Daniel Boone (Mr.Clarence Colfax)
in his Indian buckskins.Eugenie went as Marie Antoinette.Tall Maude
Catherwood was most imposing as Rebecca; and her brother George made a
towering Friar Tuck, Even little fifteen-year-old Spencer Catherwood,
the contradiction of the family, was there.He went as the lieutenant
Napoleon, walking about with his hands behind his back and his brows
thoughtfully contracted.It was at tine very height of the
festivities that Dorothy Carvel and Mr.Daniel Boone were making their
way together to the porch when the giant gate-keeper of Kenilworth
Castle came stalking up the steps out of the darkness, brandishing his
club in their faces.Dorothy screamed, and even the doughty Daniel gave
back a step."I'm sorry, Jinny, indeed I am," said the giant, repentant, and holding
her hand in his.demanded Virginia, a little mollified."I've been to a Lincoln meeting," said honest Tom; "where I heard a very
fine speech from a friend of yours.""You might have been better employed," said she, and added, with
dignity, "I have no friends who speak at Black Republican meetings.""No," said Tom, "I meant--"

He got no further.Virginia slipped her arm through Clarence's, and they
went off together to the end of the veranda.He passed on into
the gay drawing-room, but the zest had been taken out of his antics for
that night."Whom did he mean, Jinny?"said Clarence, when they were on the seat
under the vines."He meant that Yankee, Stephen Brice," answered Virginia, languidly."I
am so tired of hearing about him.""So am I," said Clarence, with a fervor by no means false."By George,
I think he will make a Black Republican out of Tom, if he keeps on.Puss and Jack have been talking about him all summer, until I am out
of patience.But suppose he has addressed fifty
Lincoln meetings, as they say, is that any reason for making much
of him?I should not have him at Bellegarde."He is on the Brinsmade charity list.""He is not on their charity list, nor on any other," said Virginia,
quickly."Stephen Brice is the last person who would submit to charity.""And you are the last person who I supposed would stand up for him,"
cried her cousin, surprised and nettled."I want to be fair, Max," she said quietly."Pa offered them our Glencoe
House last summer at a low price, and they insisted on paying what
Mr.Edwards gave five years ago,--or nothing.You know that I detest
a Yankee as much as you do," she continued, indignation growing in her
voice."I did not come out here with you to be insulted."With her hand on the rail, she made as if to rise.Clarence was perforce
mollified."Don't go, Jinny," he said beseechingly."I didn't mean to make you
angry--"

"I can't see why you should always be dragging in this Mr.Brice," she
said, almost tearfully.(It will not do to pause now and inquire into
Virginia's logic.)"I came out to hear what you had to tell me.""Jinny, I have been made second lieutenant of Company A.""Oh, Max, I am so glad!"I suppose that you have heard the result of the October elections,
Jinny.""Pa said something about them to-night," she answered; "why?""It looks now as if there were a chance of the Republicans winning," he
answered.But it was elation that caught his voice, not gloom."You mean that this white trash Lincoln may be President?""The South will not submit to that until every man
who can bear arms is shot down."The strains of a waltz
mingled with talk and laughter floated out of the open window.His voice
dropped to a low intensity."We are getting ready in Company A," he
said; "the traitors will be dropped.We are getting ready to fight for
Missouri and for the South."The girl felt his excitement, his exaltation."And if you were not, Max, I should disown you," she whispered.He leaned forward until his face was close to hers."I am ready to work, to starve, to go to prison, to help--"

He sank back heavily into the corner."Oh, if a woman could only do more!"Do you remember
when you told me that I was good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?""I have thought it over since," he went on rapidly; "you were right.I
cannot work--it is not in me.But I have always felt that I could make a
name for myself--for you--in the army.I am sure that I could command a
regiment.She did not answer him, but absently twisted the fringe of his buckskins
in her fingers."Ever since I have known what love is I have loved you, Jinny.It was so
when we climbed the cherry trees at Bellegarde.And you loved me then--I
know you did.You loved me when I went East to school at the Military
Institute.But it has not been the same of late," he faltered.I felt it first on that day you rode out to
Bellegarde when you said that my life was of no use.Jinny, I don't ask
much.War is coming, and we shall have
to free ourselves from Yankee insolence.It is what we have both wished
for.When I am a general, will you marry me?"For a wavering instant she might have thrown herself into his
outstretched arms.Why not, and have done with sickening doubts?Perhaps
her hesitation hung on the very boyishness of his proposal.Perhaps the
revelation that she did not then fathom was that he had not developed
since those childish days.But even while she held back, came the beat
of hoofs on the gravel below them, and one of the Bellegarde servants
rode into the light pouring through the open door.Clarence muttered his dismay as he followed his cousin to the steps."Nothing; I forgot to sign the deed to the Elleardsville property,
and Worington wants it to-night."Cutting short <DW71>'s explanations,
Clarence vaulted on the horse.Leaning over
in the saddle, he whispered: "I'll be back in a quarter of an hour Will
you wait?""Yes," she said, so that he barely heard.He was away at a gallop, leaving Virginia standing bareheaded to the
night, alone.A spring of pity, of affection for Clarence suddenly
welled up within her.There came again something of her old admiration
for a boy, impetuous and lovable, who had tormented and defended her
with the same hand.Patriotism, stronger in Virginia than many of us now can conceive, was
on Clarence's side.Now was she all
afire with the thought that she, a woman, might by a single word
give the South a leader.That word would steady him, for there was no
question of her influence.She trembled at the reckless lengths he might
go in his dejection, and a memory returned to her of a day at Glencoe,
before he had gone off to school, when she had refused to drive with
him.Colonel Carvel had been away from home.In spite of Ned's beseechings Clarence had ridden off on a wild
thoroughbred colt and had left her to an afternoon of agony.Vividly
she recalled his home-coming in the twilight, his coat torn and muddy, a
bleeding cut on his forehead, and the colt quivering tame.In those days she had thought of herself unreservedly as meant for
him.Dash and courage and generosity had been the beacon lights on her
horizon.Yes, and Clarence
should have these, too.She also had been
at fault, and perhaps it was because of her wavering loyalty to him that
he had not gained them.Her name spoken within the hall startled Virginia from her reverie, and
she began to walk rapidly down the winding drive.A fragment of the air
to which they were dancing brought her to a stop.It was the Jenny Lind
waltz.And with it came clear and persistent the image she had sought to
shut out and failed.As if to escape it now, she fairly ran all the way
to the light at the entrance and hid in the magnolias clustered beside
the gateway.It was her cousin's name she whispered over and over to
herself as she waited, vibrant with a strange excitement.It was as
though the very elements might thwart her wail.Clarence would be
delayed, or they would miss her at the house, and search.It seemed an
eternity before she heard the muffled thud of a horse cantering in the
clay road.Virginia stood out in the light fairly between the gate posts.Too late
she saw the horse rear as the rider flew back in his seat, for she had
seized the bridle.The beams from the lamp fell upon a Revolutionary
horseman, with cooked hat and sword and high riding-boots.For her his
profile was in silhouette, and the bold nose and chin belonged to but
one man she knew.She gave a cry of astonishment
and dropped the rein in dismay.Her
impulse was to fly, nor could she tell what force that stayed her feet.As for Stephen, he stood high in his stirrups and stared down at the
girl.She was standing full in the light,--her lashes fallen, her face
crimson.But no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she, nor
did he wonder at her gown of a gone-by century.Her words came first,
and they were low."I--I thought that you were my cousin," she said.She gave a step backward, and raised her frightened eyes to his."I can't say why," he said quickly, "but it seems to me as if this had
happened before.I know that I am talking nonsense--"

Virginia was trembling now.And her answer was not of her own choosing."It may have been in a dream," he answered her, "that I saw you as you
stand there by my bridle.And what mystery
was it that sent him here this night of all nights?She could not even
have said that it was her own voice making reply."And I--I have seen you, with the sword, and the powdered hair, and the
blue coat and the buff waistcoat.It is a buff waistcoat like that my
great-grandfather wears in his pictures.""It is a buff waistcoat," he said, all sense of strangeness gone.The roses she held dropped on the gravel, and she put out her hand
against his horse's flank.In an instant he had leaped from his saddle,
and his arm was holding her.She did not resist, marvelling rather at
his own steadiness, nor did she then resent a tenderness in his voice."I hope you will forgive me--Virginia," he said."It was I who stopped you," she said; "I was waiting for--"

"For whom?"Colfax," she answered, in another tone.And as she
spoke she drew away from him, up the driveway.But she had scarcely
taken five steps whey she turned again, her face burning defiance."They
told me you were not coming," she said almost fiercely."You know I would not have been
here had I thought you were coming.Anne promised me that you would not
come."What would she not have given for those words back again

Stephen took astride toward her, and to the girl that stride betokened a
thousand things that went to the man's character.Within its compass the
comparison in her mind was all complete.He was master of himself when
he spoke."You dislike me, Miss Carvel," he said steadily.Nor do I flatter myself that it is only because you believe one thing,
and I another.But I assure you that it is my misfortune rather than my
fault that I have not pleased you,--that I have met you only to anger
you."He paused, for she did not seem to hear him.She was gazing at the
distant lights moving on the river.Had he come one step farther?--but
he did not.Presently she knew that he was speaking again, in the same
measured tone."Had Miss Brinsmade told me that my presence here would cause you
annoyance, I should have stayed away.I hope that you will think nothing
of the--the mistake at the gate.You may be sure that I shall not
mention it.He lifted his hat, mounted his horse, and was gone.She had not even
known that he could ride--that was strangely the first thought.The
second discovered herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it
died southward upon the road.There was shame in this, mingled with a
thankfulness that he would not meet Clarence.She hurried a few steps
toward the house, and stopped again.Ringing there was her talk with
Stephen Brice, as though it were still rapidly going on.His questions
and her replies--over and over again.Each trivial incident of an
encounter real and yet unreal!His transformation in the uniform, which
had seemed so natural.Though she strove to make it so, nothing of all
this was unbearable now, nor the remembrance of the firm torch of his
arm about her nor yet again his calling her by her name.Absently she took her way again up the drive, now pausing, now going on,
forgetful.First it was alarm she felt when her cousin leaped down at
her side,--then dread."I thought I should never get back," he cried breathlessly, as he threw
his reins to <DW71>."I ought not to have asked you to wait outside.She answered something, There was a seat near by under the trees.To
lead her to it he seized her hand, but it was limp and cold, and a
sudden fear came into his voice.She remembered long how he
stood in the scattered light from the bright windows, a tall, black
figure of dismay.But her own
response, warm half an hour since, was lifeless."Jinny," he said, "what is the matter?"Only I was very foolish to say I would wait for you.""Then--then you won't marry me?""Oh, Max," she cried, "it is no time to talk of that now.I feel
to-night as if something dreadful were to happen.""But war is what we want," he cried, "what we have prayed for, what we
have both been longing for to-night, Jinny.War alone will give us our
rights--"

He stopped short.Virginia had bowed her head an her hands, and he saw
her shoulders shaken by a sob.Clarence bent over her in bewilderment
and anxiety."You are not well, Jinny," he said.But when they went in at the door, he saw that her eyes were dry.Those were the days when a dozen young ladies were in the habit of
staying all night after a dance in the country; of long whispered talks
(nay, not always whispered) until early morning.Miss Russell had not been the only one who remarked Virginia's long
absence with her cousin; but Puss found her friend in one of those moods
which even she dared not disturb.Accordingly Miss Russell stayed all
night with Anne.And the two spent most of the dark hours remaining in unprofitable
discussion as to whether Virginia were at last engaged to her cousin,
and in vain queried over another unsolved mystery.This mystery was
taken up at the breakfast table the next morning, when Miss Carvel
surprised Mrs.Brinsmade and the male household by appearing at
half-past seven.Brinsmade, "what does this mean?I always
thought that young ladies did not get up after a ball until noon.""I am going to ask you to take me to town when you go, Mr."Why, certainly, my dear," he said."But I under stood that your aunt
was to send for you this afternoon from Bellegarde.""There is something I wish to do in town.""I'll drive her in, Pa," said Jack.Will you go with
me, Jinny?""But you must eat some breakfast, Jinny," said Mrs Brinsmade, glancing
anxiously at the girl."Where was Stephen Brice last night, Jack?""I understood Anne
to say that he had spoke; of coming late.""Why, sir," said Jack, "that's what we can't make out.Tom Catherwood,
who is always doing queer things, you know, went to a Black Republican
meeting last night, and met Stephen there.They came out in Tom's buggy
to the Russells', and Tom got into his clothes first and rode over.Stephen was to have followed on Puss Russell's horse.At least I can find no one who saw him.But Virginia did not raise her eyes from her plate."There might have been an accident, Jack," said that lady, with concern."Send Nicodemus over to Mrs.Brice is a Northerner, and may not be able to ride.""He rides like a dragoon, mother," said he."I don't know where he
picked it up.""The reason I mentioned him," said Mr.Brinsmade, lifting the blanket
sheet and adjusting his spectacles, "was because his name caught my eye
in this paper.His speech last night at the Library Hall is one of the
few sensible Republican speeches I have read.I think it very remarkable
for a man as young as he."Brinsmade began to read: "'While waiting
for the speaker of the evening, who was half an hour late, Mr.Tiefel
rose in the audience and called loudly for Mr.Many citizens in
the hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention
of this name.Brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a
determined face, who has sacrificed much to the Party's cause this
summer.He was introduced by Judge Whipple, in whose office he is.He had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the
house.Brice's personality is prepossessing, his words are spoken
sharply, and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive
his arguments into the minds of his hearers.We venture to say that if
party orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as Mr.Brice; if, like him, they appealed to reason rather than to passion,
those bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our country's
peace might be amicably adjusted.'But he was interrupted by the rising of Virginia.A high color was on
the girl's face as she said:

"Please excuse me, Mrs.Brinsmade, I must go and get ready.""But you've eaten nothing, my dear.""You ought not have read that, Pa," Mr.Jack remonstrated; "you know
that she detests Yankees."THE BREACH BECOMES TOO WIDE ABRAHAM LINCOLN!At the foot of Breed's Hill in Charlestown an American had been born
into the world, by the might of whose genius that fateful name was
sped to the uttermost parts of the nation.Abraham Lincoln was elected
President of the United States.And the moan of the storm gathering in
the South grew suddenly loud and louder.Stephen Brice read the news in the black headlines and laid down the
newspaper, a sense of the miraculous upon him.There again was the
angled, low-celled room of the country tavern, reeking with food and
lamps and perspiration; for a central figure the man of surpassing
homeliness,--coatless, tieless, and vestless,--telling a story in
the vernacular.He reflected that it might well seem strange yea, and
intolerable--to many that this comedian of the country store, this crude
lawyer and politician, should inherit the seat dignified by Washington
and the Adamses.For to him had been vouchsafed the glimpse
beyond.That was a dark winter that followed, the darkest in our history.Gloom
and despondency came fast upon the heels of Republican exultation.Men
rose early for tidings from Charleston, the storm centre.Would it crumble in pieces before Abraham
Lincoln got to Washington?One smoky morning early in December Stephen arrived late at the office
to find Richter sitting idle on his stool, concern graven on his face."The Judge has had no breakfast, Stephen," he whispered.Shadrach tells me he has been doing that since six this morning, when he
got his newspaper."Stephen listened, and he heard the Judge pacing and pacing in his room.Presently the door was flung open, And they saw Mr.Whipple standing in
the threshold, stern and dishevelled.He came out and sat down in Stephen's chair, striking the newspaper in
his hand, and they feared at first that his Mind had wandered.he cried, "propitiate, propitiate, and again propitiate.Suddenly he turned upon Stephen, who was frightened.But now his voice was natural, and he thrust the paper into the young
man's lap."Have you read the President's message to Congress, sir?God
help me that I am spared to call that wobbling Buchanan President.Perhaps you can tell me why,
if a man admits that it is wrong for a state to abandon this Union, he
cannot call upon Congress for men and money to bring her back.No, this
weakling lets Floyd stock the Southern arsenals.He is for bribing them not to be angry.Take Cuba from Spain,
says he, and steal the rest of Mexico that the maw of slavery may be
filled, and the demon propitiated."And so he went back into his room, shutting
the door.That day no clients saw him, even those poor ones dependent
on his charity whom had never before denied.Richter and Stephen took
counsel together, and sent Shadrach out for his dinner.There arrived a sparkling Sunday, brought down the
valley of the Missouri from the frozen northwest.The Saturday had been
soggy and warm.Thursday had seen South Carolina leave that Union into which she was
born, amid prayers and the ringing of bells.A young lady, who had listened to a solemn sermon of Dr.Posthelwaite's, slipped out of Church before the prayers were ended,
and hurried into that deserted portion of the town about the Court House
where on week days business held its sway.She stopped once at the bottom of the grimy flight of steps leading to
Judge Whipple's office.At the top she paused again, and for a short
space stood alert, her glance resting on the little table in the corner,
on top of which a few thumbed law books lay neatly piled.Once she made
a hesitating step in this direction.Then, as if by a resolution quickly
taken, she turned her back and softly opened the door of the Judge's
room.A book was open in his lap,
but it did not seem to Virginia that he was reading it."Uncle Silas," she said, "aren't you coming to dinner any more?"He looked up swiftly from under his shaggy brows."Uncle Silas," said Virginia, bravely, "I came to get you to-day."Never before had she known him to turn away from man or woman, but now
Judge Whipple drew his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose
violently.A woman's intuition told her that locked tight in his heart
was what he longed to say, and could not.The shiny black overcoat he
wore was on the bed.Virginia picked it up and held it out to him, an
appeal in her eyes.Many people walking home
from church that morning marvelled as they saw these two on Locust
Street together, the young girl supporting the elderly man over the
slippery places at the crossings.For neighbor had begun to look coldly
upon neighbor.Colonel Carvel beheld them from his armchair by the sitting-room window,
and leaned forward with a start.His lips moved as he closed his Bible
reverently and marked his place.At the foot of the stairs he surprised
Jackson by waving him aside, for the Colonel himself flung open the door
and held out his hand to his friend.The Judge released Virginia's arm,
and his own trembled as he gave it."Silas," said the Colonel, "Silas, we've missed you."Virginia stood by, smiling, but her breath came deeply.Judge Whipple did not go in at the
door--He stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold, his head flung
back, and actual fierceness in his stare."Do you guess we can keep off the subject, Comyn?"Carvel, so used to the Judge's ways, was a bit taken aback by
this question.It set him tugging at his goatee, and his voice was not
quite steady as he answered:

"God knows, Silas.We are human, and we can only try."It lacked a quarter of an hour of
dinner,--a crucial period to tax the resources of any woman.Virginia
led the talk, but oh, the pathetic lameness of it.Her own mind was
wandering when it should not, and recollections she had tried to
strangle had sprung up once more.Only that morning in church she had
lived over again the scene by Mr.Brinsmade's gate, and it was then that
a wayward but resistless impulse to go to the Judge's office had seized
her.The thought of the old man lonely and bitter in his room decided
her.On her knees she prayed that she might save the bond between him
and her father.For the Colonel had been morose on Sundays, and had
taken to reading the Bible, a custom he had not had since she was a
child.In the dining-room Jackson, bowing and smiling, pulled out the Judge's
chair, and got his customary curt nod as a reward."Oh, Uncle Silas," she cried, "I am so glad that we have a wild turkey.The girl carved deftly, feverishly,
talking the while, aided by that most kind and accomplished of hosts,
her father.In the corner the dreaded skeleton of the subject grinned
sardonically.Were they going to be able to keep it off?There was to be
no help from Judge Whipple, who sat in grim silence.A man who feels
his soul burning is not given to small talk.Virginia alone had ever
possessed the power to make him forget."Uncle Silas, I am sure there are some things about our trip that we
never told you.How we saw Napoleon and his beautiful Empress driving
in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people.I never
saw such enthusiasm in my life.And oh, I learned such a lot of French
history.All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus
along the Loire.You really ought to have
gone with us.""I had other work to do, Jinny," said the Judge."I told you that we stayed with a real lord in England, didn't I?""He wasn't half as nice as the Prince.But he had a beautiful house
in Surrey, all windows, which was built in Elizabeth's time.They called
the architecture Tudor, didn't they, Pa?""Yes, dear," said the Colonel, smiling."The Countess was nice to me," continued the girl, "and took me to
garden parties.But Lord Jermyn was always talking politics."The Colonel was stroking his goatee."Tell Silas about the house, Jinny--Jackson, help the Judge again.""No," said Virginia, drawing a breath."I'm going to tell him about that
queer club where my great-grand-father used to bet with Charles Fox.We
saw a great many places where Richard Carvel had been in England.Uncle Daniel read me some of his memoirs when
we were at Calvert House.I know that you would be interested in them,
Uncle Silas."And fought for his country and for his flag, Virginia," said the Judge,
who had scarcely spoken until then."No, I could not bear to read them
now, when those who should love that country are leaving it in passion."Virginia did not dare to look at her father.But the Colonel said, gently:

"Not in passion, Silas, but in sorrow."But the effort was beyond him, and the
flood within him broke loose."Colonel Carvel," he cried, "South Carolina is mad--She is departing in
sin, in order that a fiendish practice may be perpetuated.If her people
stopped to think they would know that slavery cannot exist except by
means of this Union.But let this milksop of a President do his worst.We have chosen a man who has the strength to say, 'You shall not go!'"The saving grace of it was that respect and love
for her father filled Virginia's heart.In his just anger Colonel
Carvel remembered that he was the host, and strove to think only of his
affection for his old friend."To invade a sovereign state, sir, is a crime against the sacred spirit
of this government," he said."There is no such thing as a sovereign state, sir," exclaimed the Judge,
hotly."I am an American, and not a Missourian.""When the time comes, sir," said the Colonel, with dignity, "Missouri
will join with her sister sovereign states against oppression.""Missouri will not secede, sir.""Because, sir, when the worst comes, the Soothing Syrup men will rally
for the Union.And there are enough loyal people here to keep her
straight."Foreign Republican hirelings, sir," exclaimed
the Colonel, standing up."We shall drive them like sheep if they oppose
us.You are drilling them now that they may murder your own blood when
you think the time is ripe."The Colonel did not hear Virginia leave the room, so softly had she
gone, He made a grand figure of a man as he stood up, straight and tall,
those gray eyes a-kindle at last.But the fire died as quickly as it had
flared.Pity had come and quenched it,--pity that an unselfish life
of suffering and loneliness should be crowned with these.The Colonel
longed then to clasp his friend in his arms.Quarrels they had had
by the hundred, never yet a misunderstanding.God had given to Silas
Whipple a nature stern and harsh that repelled all save the charitable
few whose gift it was to see below the surface, and Colonel Carvel had
been the chief of them.But now the Judge's vision was clouded.Steadying himself by his chair, he had risen glaring, the loose skin
twitching on his sallow face.He began firmly but his voice shook ere he
had finished."Colonel Carvel," said he, "I expect that the day has come when you
go your way and I go mine.It will be better if--we do not meet again,
sir."And so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the
score of years he had battled with his enemies, from that house which
had been for so long his only home.For the last time Jackson came
forward to help him with his coat.The Judge did not see him, nor did he
see the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above.Whipple, blinded by a moisture strange to
his eyes, clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps.Before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own, and was
helping him.The Judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve, and turned a defiant face
upon Captain Elijah Brent--then his voice broke.His anger was
suddenly gone, and his thought had flown back to the Colonel's thousand
charities."Lige," he said, "Lige, it has come."In answer the Captain pressed the Judge's hand, nodding vigorously to
hide his rising emotion.cried the Captain, "I wish I knew.""Lige," said the Judge, gravely, "you're too good a man to be for
Soothing Syrup.""You're too smart to be fooled, Lige," he said, with a note near to
pleading."The time has come when you Bell people and the Douglas people
have got to decide.Never in my life did I know it to do good to dodge
a question.We've got to be white or black, Lige.Nobody's got much
use for the grays.And don't let yourself be fooled with Constitutional
Union Meetings, and compromises.The time is almost here, Lige, when it
will take a rascal to steer a middle course."Captain Lige listened, and he shifted from one foot to the other, and
rubbed his hands, which were red.Some odd trick of the mind had put
into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme."Lige, you've got to decide.Can you look
on while our own states defy us, and not lift a hand?Can you sit still
while the Governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting
to take Missouri, too, out of the Union?The militia is riddled with
rebels, and the rest are forming companies of minute men.""And you Black Republicans," the Captain cried "have organized your
Dutch Wideawakes, and are arming them to resist Americans born.""They are Americans by our Constitution, sir, which the South pretends
to revere," cried the Judge."And they are showing themselves better
Americans than many who have been on the soil for generations.""My sympathies are with the South," said the Captain, doggedly, "and my
love is for the South."Both men raised their eyes to the house of him
whose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both.When at
last the Captain spoke, his voice was rent with feeling."Judge," he began, "when I was a poor young man on the old 'Vicksburg',
second officer under old Stetson, Colonel Carvel used to take me up to
his house on Fourth Street to dinner.And he gave me the clothes on
my back, so that I might not be ashamed before the fashion which came
there.One day the sheriff sold the
Vicksburg.That left me high and dry in the mud.And he says to me, 'Lige, you're
captain now, the youngest captain on the river.You
can pay me principal and interest when you get ready.'"Judge Whipple, I never had any other home than right in, this house.I
never had any other pleasure than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin' to
show 'em gratitude.He took me into his house and cared for me at a time
when I wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when I was
a wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation.Judge,
I'd a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in
here and tell him I'd fight for the North."The Judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without
a word.For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him.Then he slowly
climbed the steps and disappeared.MUTTERINGS

Early in the next year, 1861,--that red year in the Calendar of our
history,--several gentlemen met secretly in the dingy counting-room of
a prominent citizen to consider how the state of Missouri might be saved
to the Union.One of these gentlemen was Judge Whipple, another, Mr.Brinsmade; and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward
became a general, and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the
Leader.By his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black
situation St.Louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession.Alas, that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of
a time.There is Captain Nathaniel Lyon,--name with the fateful ring.Nathaniel Lyon, with the wild red hair and blue eye, born and bred a
soldier, ordered to St.Louis, and become subordinate to a wavering
officer of ordnance.Lyon was one who brooked no trifling.He had the
face of a man who knows his mind and intention; the quick speech and
action which go with this.Red tape made by the reel to bind him, he
broke.Courts-martial had no terrors for him.He proved the ablest of
lieutenants to the strong civilian who was the Leader.If God had willed that the South should win, there
would have been no occasion.Even as Judge Whipple had said, the time was come for all men to decide.Out of the way, all hopes of compromises that benumbed Washington.No
Constitutional Unionists, no Douglas Democrats, no Republicans now.The speech-making was not done with yet.Partisanship must be overcome, and patriotism instilled in its place.One day Stephen Brice saw the Leader go into Judge Whipple's room,
and presently he was sent for.After that he was heard of in various
out-of-the-way neighborhoods, exhorting all men to forget their quarrels
and uphold the flag.The Leader himself knew not night from day in his toil,--in organizing,
conciliating, compelling when necessary.And, after that solemn inauguration, between him and
Washington.It was an open secret that the Governor of Missouri held out
his arms to Jefferson Davis, just elected President of the new Southern
Confederacy.It soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the Leader
and his friends had perceived long before, that the Governor intended
to use the militia (purged of Yankee sympathizers) to save the state for
the South.The Government Arsenal, with its stores of arms and ammunition, was
the prize.This building and its grounds lay to the south of the
City, overlooking the river.It was in command of a doubting major
of ordnance; the corps of officers of Jefferson Barracks hard by was
mottled with secession.In all the South, Pickens and Sumter alone stood
stanch to the flag.A general, wearing the uniform of the army of the
United States, surrendered the whole state of Texas.Louis Arsenal was next in succession, and the little band of
regulars at the Barracks was powerless to save it.What could the Leader
and Captain Lyon do without troops?That was the question that rang
in Stephen's head, and in the heads of many others.For, if President
Lincoln sent troops to St.And the President had other uses for the handful in the army.There came a rain-sodden night when a mysterious message arrived at
the little house in Olive Street.Brice's eyes as they followed her son out of the door.At Twelfth
Street two men were lounging on the corners, each of whom glanced at
him listessly as he passed.He went up a dark and narrow stair into a
lighted hall with shrouded windows.Men with sober faces were forming
line on the sawdust of the floors.The Leader was there giving military
orders in a low voice.That marked the beginning of the aggressive Union
movement.Stephen, standing apart at the entrance, remarked that many of the men
were Germans.Indeed, he spied his friend Tiefel there, and presently
Richter came from the ranks to greet him."My friend," he said, "you are made second lieutenant of our company,
the Black Jaegers.""But I have never drilled in my life," said Stephen.The Leader, smiling a little, put a vigorous stop to his protestations,
and told him to buy a tactics.The next man Stephen saw was big Tom
Catherwood, who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned Stephen's
grip."Well," said Tom, embarrassed, "a fellow has got to do what he think's
right.""I reckon they'll disown me, Stephen, when they find it out."Richter walked home as far as Stephen's house.He was to take the Fifth
Street car for South St.And they talked of Tom's courage, and of
the broad and secret military organization the Leader had planned that
night.Could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming, and leave
his mother dependent upon charity?It was shortly after this that Stephen paid his last visit for many a
long day upon Miss Puss Russell.It was a Sunday afternoon, and Puss was
entertaining, as usual, a whole parlor-full of young men, whose leanings
and sympathies Stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall.Then he heard Miss Russell cry:

"I believe that they are drilling those nasty Dutch hirelings in
secret.""I am sure they are," said George Catherwood."One of the halls is on
Twelfth Street, and they have sentries posted out so that you can't get
near them.And he told him that if
he ever got evidence of it, he'd show him the door.""Do you really think that Tom is with the Yankees?""Tom's a fool," said George, with emphasis, "but he isn't a coward.He'd just as soon tell Pa to-morrow that he was drilling if the Yankee
leaders wished it known.""Virginia will never speak to him again," said Eugenie, in an awed
voice.said Puss, "Tom never had a chance with Jinny.Did you ever know any one to change so,
since this military business has begun?I hear
that they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons.""And that is the company I intend to join.""Well," began Puss, with her usual recklessness, "it's a good thing for
Clarence that all this is happening.I know somebody else--"

Poor Stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly.Emily Russell came down the stairs at that instant
and spoke to him.As the two entered the parlor, there was a hush
pregnant with many things unsaid.Puss's face was scarlet, but her hand
was cold as she held it out to him.For the first time in that house
he felt like an intruder.Jack Brinsmade bowed with great ceremony,
and took his departure.There was scarcely a distant cordiality in
the greeting of the other young men.And Puss, whose tongue was loosed
again, talked rapidly of entertainments to which Stephen either had not
been invited, or from which he had stayed away.The rest of the company
were almost moodily silent.Profoundly depressed, Stephen sat straight in the velvet chair, awaiting
a seasonable time to bring his visit to a close.This was to be the last, then, of his intercourse with a warmhearted
and lovable people.This was to be the end of his friendship with this
impetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life
since he had come to St: Louis.Henceforth this house would be shut to
him, and all others save Mr.Presently, in one of the intervals of Miss Russell's feverish talk,
he rose to go.Dusk was gathering, and a deep and ominous silence
penetrated like the shadows into the tall room.Impulsively, almost tearfully, Puss put her hand in his.Then she
pressed it unexpectedly, so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in
his throat.Just then a loud cry was heard from without, the men jumped
from their chairs, and something heavy dropped on the carpet.Some ran to the window, others to the door.Directly across the street
was the house of Mr.One of the third
story windows was open, and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood
smoke.George Catherwood was the first to speak."I hope it will burn down," he cried.Stephen picked up the object on the floor, which had dropped from his
pocket, and handed it to him.THE GUNS OF SUMTER

Winter had vanished.Toward a little island
set in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still
hours of the night for the guns of Sumter.One sultry night in April
Stephen's mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them.that is the roar now, faint but sullen.That is the red flash
far across the black Southern sky.For in our beds are the terrors and
cruelties of life revealed to us.There is a demon to be faced, and
nought alone.The lightning revealed her as she bent over him.On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston
house with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high
windows looking out across the Common.Often in the dark had she come to
him thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.She said: "Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come."Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.We have nothing left but the little I
earn.And if I were--" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her
trembling.But she said again, with that courage which seems woman's
alone:

"Remember Wilton Brice.It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the
night.How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself!He,
Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union,
a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike!He had talked for his
country, but he would not risk his life for it.He saw them passing him silently on the street.Shamefully
he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very
uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.And high above the tier of his
accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of
his soul.Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the
struggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness.If
he were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!)she would respect him for risking life for conviction.If he stayed at
home, she would not understand.And
yet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to
follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.The rain was come now, in a flood.Stephen's mother could not see in the
blackness the bitterness on his face.Above the roar of the waters she
listened for his voice."I will not go, mother," he said."If at length every man is needed,
that will be different.""It is for you to decide, my son," she answered."There are many ways in
which you can serve your country here.But remember that you may have to
face hard things.""I have had to do that before, mother," he replied calmly."I cannot
leave you dependent upon charity."She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his
ambition at her feet.It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came.All through
the Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked
on.Through a wide land was that numbness which
precedes action.Force of habit sent men to their places of business,
to sit idle.South
Carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers.The outraged reply of her governor
went back,--never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states.Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of
all the Union in the number of men she was to give.To her was credited
in the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land.On the Monday
morning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter
at the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his
face.The light of the zealot was on Richter's own."We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders.Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down
rebellion."Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head.What would
he think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native
land for his convictions?Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die
for them?How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?"Carl," he said at length, "I--I cannot go."But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands
impulsively on Stephen's shoulders."Ach, I see," he said.It shall be
for your mother while you are away."Then, in spite of
his feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his
character.implored Richter, "I would give a fortune, if
I had it.Ah, my friend, that would please me so.And I do not need the
money now.Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across
the river on the wind.Stephen turned to the open window, tears of
intense agony in his eyes.In that instant he saw the regiment marching,
and the flag flying at its head."It is my duty to stay here, Carl," he said brokenly.Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped.He realized that
with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable.In
all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change.With the
demonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew
not how.Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be
broken down.At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass
door, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that
first day he had gone in there.Whipple himself closed the door, and
then the transom.Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their
hiding-place.Brice," he said at last, "the President has called for seventy-five
thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion.They will go, and be
swallowed up, and more will go to fill their places.Brice, people
will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days.But I tell you,
sir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days."He brought
down his fist heavily upon the table."This, sir, will be a war to the
death.One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let,
and until their homes are all ruins."He darted at Stephen one look from
under those fierce eyebrows."No, sir," he answered, steadily, "not
now."Then he began what seemed a never-ending search
among the papers on his desk.At length he drew out a letter, put on his
spectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.Whipple, "you are doing a courageous thing.But if
we elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to
escape persecution, sir.Two weeks ago," he continued slowly, "two weeks
ago I had a letter from Mr.cried Stephen

The Judge smiled a little.Lincoln never forgets any one," said
he."He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the
Republican party, and sends you his kindest regards."This was the first and only time that Mr.Whipple spoke to him of his
labors.Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he
would not have heard of them at all had not the Judge's sense of duty
compelled him to convey the message.And it was with a lighter heart
than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the
United States.And in response to his
appeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President
had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as
the regiments marched past.Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight
as Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant.And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant
that Stephen himself should have filled.Here was another company,
and at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood.His father
had disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little
Spencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag
drooped.Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen
threaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his
very soul.He went past the house where the strange flag hung against
its staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged.The house
was thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of
honored families.And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee
cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to
the strange banner that they had set up.In the hall, through the open
doorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen.The guardians
were the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the
state of Missouri.Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people,
and among these Stephen paused.Two young men were standing on the
steps, and one was Clarence Colfax.His hands were in his pockets, and
a careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the
street.Anger swept over him in a hot flame,
as at the slave auction years agone.That was the unquenchable fire of
the war.The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet
he stopped.What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before
that house?CAMP JACKSON

What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861!Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred
feet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is
gathering there.Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to
Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the
strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands
are playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited
chargers.One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in
line; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies
often in their Sunday clothes.But they walk with heads erect and chests
out, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them.Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington
Guards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and
Davis Guards.Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday.And the colors
are the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.A clatter and a
cloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves
the length of the crowd.Here they come
at last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing
quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons.Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia's arm.There, riding in front, erect
and firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax.Virginia is red and
white, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy.Oh, that was his true
calling, a soldier's life.In that moment she saw him at the head of
armies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still
northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation.Down to a trot they slow, Clarence's black thorough-bred arching his
long neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and
four.The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose
horse is built like a Crusader's, is George Catherwood.And Eugenie
gives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.Can the Yankee regiments with their
slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it!If there are any Yankees in Twelfth
Street that day, they are silent.And there are
some, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union.There is another wait, the companies standing at ease.Some of the
dragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides
straight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel
wrings his gauntleted hand."Clarence, we are proud of you, sir," he says.And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers
caressing the silken curve of Jefferson's neck."Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.""Hush, Jinny," he answered, "we are merely going into camp to learn to
drill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.""You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear," said the Colonel.But he must needs press Virginia's hand
first, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his.Then he goes
off at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and
turning to give the sharp order, "Attention"!Once more she has swept from her heart
every vestige of doubt.Chosen
unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had
taken command like a veteran.George Catherwood and Maurice had told the
story.And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North.The bands are started, the general and
staff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road,
followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars
crowded.Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and
behind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the
girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley
wires, was a country road then.Green trees took the place of crowded
rows of houses and stores, and little "bob-tail" yellow cars were drawn
by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by
a board fence, known as Lindell Grove.It was then a resort, a picnic
ground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown
the wear of time.Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the
proprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents
under the spreading trees.The gallant dragoons were off to the west,
across a little stream which trickled through the grounds.By the side
of it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting
his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and
staggered under it to the line.The
Captain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in
the ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew
that day played a hundred pranks.To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his
goatee and guffawed."How mean, Pa," she said indignantly."How car, you expect them to do it
right the first day, and in this wind?""He is pulled
over on his head."And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by
laughed, too."You will see that they can fight," she said."They can beat the Yankees
and Dutch."This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in
response to other smiles."My dear," he said, "you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of
instruction of the state militia.There fly the Stars and Stripes from
the general's tent.Do you see that they are above the state flag?Jinny stamped her foot

"Oh, I hate dissimulation," she cried, "Why can't we, say outright that
we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and
Hessians out of the Arsenal."She had forgotten that one of
her brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians."Why aren't women made generals and governors?""If we were," answered Virginia, "something might be accomplished.""Isn't Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?"But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was
seen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them.He
was followed by George Catherwood."Come, Jinny," cried her cousin, "let us go over to the main camp.""And walk on Davis Avenue," said Virginia, flushing with pride."Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue," said George, taking
his sister's arm."We shall walk in them all," said Virginia.The rustling trees and the young grass
of early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military
precision.Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud
fathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala
dress.Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women.The day is coming
when you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to
stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp
Jackson.All the fashion and beauty of the city were there.The bands
played, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses,
and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young
gentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets.All was not
soldier fare at the regimental messes.Cakes and jellies and even ices
and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents.Dress
parade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than
to have been a young man in St.Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and
not be a militiaman.One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity
about him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered "silent
partner") of Carvel & Company.Eliphalet had had political
ambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just
passed, he had not shown them.Cluyme (no mean business man himself)
had pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended
to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself.Seeing a regiment of
Missouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens' clothes he
had been remarked to smile cynically.But he kept his opinions so close
that he was supposed not to have any.On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, an event occurred in Mr.Carvel's
store which excited a buzz of comment.Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o'clock.To be sure, times were more than dull.The Colonel that morning had read
over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the
impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the
country.The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed.Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's
table.Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself
into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who
might enter.In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western
gate of the camp on the Olive Street road.Refreshing himself with a
little tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between
the rows of tents.A philosophy of his own (which many men before and
since have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature
at the open love-making around him.He imagined his own figure,--which
was already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck
trousers, and laughed.Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that
kind.These heroes might have their hero-worship.As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so
chanced that he was overtaken by Mr.Only
that morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column
of his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink.He
reminded his wife that Mr.Hopper had not been to supper of late.Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality.Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own.But it may be well to remark that Mr.Hopper himself did not do any
squeezing.He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle."I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr."We only have plain and simple things, but they are
wholesome, sir.Dainties are poor things to work on.I told that to his
Royal Highness when he was here last fall.He was speaking to me on the
merits of roast beef--"

"It's a fine day," said Mr.Letting his gaze wander over the camp,
he added casually, "I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers
since yesterday.I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about,
which came on the 'Swon' marked'marble.'They say Jeff Davis sent the
stuff to 'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton
Rouge.They're pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now."He was not greatly interested in
this matter which had stirred the city to the quick.Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved.Just then, as if to spare the
pains of a reply, a "Jenny Lind" passed them.Miss Belle recognized the
carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known
in St.Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and
heavily veiled.As the mother-in-law of the stalwart
Union leader of the city, Miss Belle's comment about her appearance in
Camp Jackson was not out of place.she exclaimed, "I'd like to know what she's doing here!"Hopper's answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few
days, engendered in Mr.Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of."I don't know," said Eliphalet; "but I cal'late she's got stouter.""That Union principles must be healthy," said he, and laughed.Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma.The appearance
of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind.Eliphalet, too, had seen them.One was the tall young Captain of
Dragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown
hair, in a lawn dress."They think they are alone in the
garden of Eden.But since he's
a captain, and has got a uniform, she's come round pretty quick.I'm
thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms."She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the
approaching couple."Clarence is handsome, but worthless," she continued in her sprightly
way."I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him.Do you think
she's so very pretty, Mr."Neither do I," Miss Belle assented.And upon that, greatly to
the astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them.she cried; "Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell
you!"The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was
not one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.Putting her arm through
Virginia's, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds,
Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to
hide his annoyance.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost
in the crowd.That expression of Virginia's had reminded him of a
time, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from
Kentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival.And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.She has wealth, and manners,
and looks.Too bad he holds such views
on secession.I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly
fortunate in your connection with him."There was a point of light now in each of Mr.Cluyme continued:

"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by
his opinions."And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--"

But Mr.Cluyme has misjudged his man.If he had come to Eliphalet for
information of Colonel Carvel's affairs, or of any one else's affairs,
he was not likely to get it.It is not meet to repeat here the long
business conversation which followed.Cluyme,
who was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet
as when he met him.But he had a greater respect than ever for the
shrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company..........................

That same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering
jubilantly in each other's ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and
stands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening
within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal,
far to the southward.The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen.Richter gone, and the
Judge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at
a spell the sole tenant of the office.Fortunately there was work of
Richter's and of Mr.Whipple's left undone that kept him busy.This
Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best
black coat which he wore on occasions.His manner had recently lost much
of its gruffness."Stephen," said he, "they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the
regiments at the arsenal.asked Stephen, when they had reached the
street."Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the
first trick, sir," said the Judge.As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen's attention was at once
attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about
him.He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation.He
had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of
military abruptness."That is Major William T. Sherman," said the Judge to Stephen."He
used to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War.He came here two
months ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line."They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major
Sherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him
a vigorous nod."Well, Whipple," he said, "this nation is going to the devil; eh?"For it was a bold man who expressed
radical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St."Who's man enough in Washington
to shake his fist in a rebel's face?Our leniency--our timidity--has
paralyzed us, sir."By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in
the conversation.Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge,
once launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings."Seventy-five thousand for three months!"said the Major, vehemently,
"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we'll need all the
water we've got in the North."The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr.Lincoln would
draw all the water before he got through.Now's the time to stop
'em.The longer we let 'em rear and kick, the harder to break 'em.You
don't catch me going back to the army for three months.If they want me,
they've got to guarantee me three years.Turning
to Stephen, he added: "Don't you sign any three months' contract, young
man."By this time the car was full, and silent.No one had
offered to quarrel with the Major.Nor did it seem likely that any one
would."I'm afraid I can't go, sir.""Because, sir," said the Judge, bluntly, "his mother's a widow, and they
have no money.He was a lieutenant in one of Blair's companies before
the call came."The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.Stephen's expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more
vigorously than before.But he hoped to fall out of the talk.Much to his
discomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks.His whole
manner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain
Elijah Brent."Aren't you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile
Library Hall?"At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen's."Well, sir," he said, "I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except
some of Abraham Lincoln's.Brinsmade gave it to me to read.Whipple,
that speech reminded me of Lincoln.Lincoln's debate with Judge Douglas at 'Freeport," said
Stephen; beginning to be amused."I admire your frankness, sir," he said."I meant to say that its logic
rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.""I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman."At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds.Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last
in the blue of their country's service.Old soldiers with baskets of
cartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the
recruits.Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not
enough belts to go around.The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen
saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned.It was driven away again by Major Sherman's vivacious comments.For
suddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.cried the Major, "he's a man after my own heart.Just
look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the
papers bulging from his pockets.But
this isn't the time to be dignified.If there were some like Lyon in
Washington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time.The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major
Sherman's picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment,
and from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing,
gesticulating, commanding.In him Stephen recognized the force that had
swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the
tape with which they had tied him.Would he be duped by the Governor's ruse of establishing a State Camp at
this time?Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not.This
man could see to the bottom, through every specious argument.Little
matters of law and precedence did not trouble him.Nor did he believe
elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops
were there for peace.After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to
Captain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of
the Volunteer regiments.Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the
regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march."We are not consulted, my friend," he said."Will you come into my
quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?"It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship
was gone.To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were
asunder, and he was become an outcast.THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED

That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something
was to happen.For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension
which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday's
incidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed."I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day," he said to
his mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room."I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them
finishing the equipment of the new regiments.Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about.I think he
must have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from
the South."Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the
apprehension she felt."Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?""I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops.I meant to tell
you about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used
to be in the army.Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many
other prominent men here.Louis some months ago to take
the position of president of the Fifth Street Line.He is the keenest,
the most original man I have ever met.As long as I live I shall never
forget his description of Lyon.""Is the Major going back into the army?"Brice, Stephen
did not remark the little falter in her voice.He laughed over the
recollection of the conversation in the street car."Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him," he said."He
thinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple
to say so anywhere.I could not have believed it possible that two men
could have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and
not be shot down.I thought that it was as much as a man's life is worth
to mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd.Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to
make your hair stand on end.""He must be a bold man," murmured Mrs."Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?""Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number."Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief."I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen," she said.From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed
very far away.The morning sun poured in through the south windows and
was scattered by the silver on the sideboard.From above, on the wall,
Colonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down.Stephen's eyes lighted on the
portrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to
ply his father with questions about it.Then the picture had suggested
only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history.Something
worthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high.The hatred and the
suffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of
loving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas,
Will war ever be painted with a wart?The sound of feet was heard on the pavement.Stephen rose, glancing at
his mother."I am going to the Arsenal," he said.To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women.She did
not try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by.But when the door had
shut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to
strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag,
ominously quiet at that early hour.At sight of it anger made him hot
again.Louis stood at the end of the line, fast
filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of
the equipment of the new troops.There was little talk among them, and
that little guarded.It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into
life at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory
of their first green.Stephen found the shaded street in front of the
Arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd.Sharp commands broke the
silence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the
wall.Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no
part.As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once
more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices
close beside him.Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr.Hopper," he said, "in spite of what you say, I expect you
are dust as eager as I am to see what is going on.You've taken an early
start this morning for sightseeing."Eliphalet's equanimity was far from shaken."I don't cal'late to take a great deal of stock in the military," he
answered.And a man must keep an eye on what
is moving."Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his
voice."You're right, Hopper," he assented."And if this city is going to be
Union, we ought to know it right away."Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of
a man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward
before Mr."My friend," said the stranger, quietly, "I think we have met before,
when your actions were not greatly to your credit.I do not forget a
face, even when I see it in the dark.Now I hear you utter words which
are a disgrace to a citizen of the United States.As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that
Eliphalet had changed countenance.The manner of an important man of
affairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him.He
took a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift.Stephen rejoiced
to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company
before that dignitary had time to depart, and stand unconcernedly there
as if nothing had occurred.He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a
great El Sol cigar.He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch
hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots.His trousers were creased at
the knees.His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and
leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively.He had a light brown beard
that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.And yet the very plainness of the man's
appearance only added to his curiosity.His
words, his action, too, had been remarkable.The art of administering
a rebuke like that was not given to many men.It was perfectly quiet,
perfectly final.And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and
dismissed it.Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper.Stephen
had suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain,
and hence the conversation with Mr.Cluyme had given him no shock in
the way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel
Carvel to hear it?Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the
cigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple?The sudden rattle of drums
gave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and
hatred fast widening between the friends.All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand
against the tree-box.A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate,
the Union leader in his colonel's uniform, on horseback at its head.He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle,
chatting with other officers around him.Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up
to the Colonel's horse, He was still smoking.This move, too, was
surprising enough, It argued even more assurance."Colonel Blair, my name is Grant," he said briefly.The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially,
"Captain Ulysses Grant," said he; "of the old army?""I wanted to wish you luck," he said."Thank you, Grant," answered the Colonel."I moved to Illinois after I left here," replied Mr.Grant, as quietly
as before, "and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there.I
went down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to
be of any help I could.They made me a clerk in the adjutant general's
office of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while."He
paused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into
the Colonel's comprehension."Then they found out that I'd been
quartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders
Now I'm a state mustering officer.I came down to Belleville to muster
in a regiment, which wasn't ready.And so I ran over here to see what
you fellows were doing."If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone,
it is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since
the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter.Grant
possessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however;
that Colonel Blair had other things to think of.Nevertheless he said
kindly:

"Aren't you going in, Grant?""I can't afford to go in as a captain of volunteers," was the calm
reply: "I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can
command a regiment."The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not
reply.Some of the younger officers
who were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized
as having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington's, and whose
stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly."I guess I'm about as fit to
command a regiment as Grant is.""That man's forty years old, if he's a day," put in another."I remember
when he came here to St.He'd resigned from
the army on the Pacific Coast.He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois
Road, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until
last year."I spotted him by the El Sol cigar.He used to bring a
load of wood to the city once in a while, and then he'd go over to the
Planters' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows,
and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian.After that he
came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one
winter.Curious, it is just a year ago this
month than he went over to Illinois.He's an honest fellow, and hard
working enough, but he don't know how.laughed the first, again, as of this in particular
had struck his sense of humor."I guess he won't get a regiment in a
hurry, There's lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for
good jobs now.""He might fool you fellows yet," said the one caller, though his tone
was not one of conviction."I understand he had a first-rate record an
the Mexican War."Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which
put an end to this desultory talk.As the First Regiment took up
the march, the words "Camp Jackson" ran from mouth to mouth on the
sidewalks.Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on
passing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming
hosts beating in his ears.In the city, shutters were going up on the stores.The streets were
filled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here
and there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the <DW64>
drivers betraying their excitement.While Stephen related to his mother
the events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner.It lay; still
untouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the
front steps.Sigel's regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its
wake a seething crowd.Three persons came out of the big house next door.One was Anna
Brinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered.His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he
struggling in her grasp.Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of
a pepperbox revolver."Do you think I can stay here while my
people are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?"Brinsmade, sternly, "I cannot let you join a mob.I
cannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.""You cannot prevent me, sir," shouted the young man, in a frenzy."When
foreigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them
down."Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of
the regiment.Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and
while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream.After that
silence fell upon the street, and Mr.Brinsmade turned and went back
into the house, his head bowed as in prayer.Stephen and his mother drew
back, but Anne saw them."He is a rebel," she faltered.She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes."I cannot stay here mother," he said.As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name.He
paused, and she caught his sleeve."I knew you would go," she said, "I knew you would go.Oh, Stephen, you
have a cool head.But when he reached the corner and
looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to
meet his mother.Now and again he was
stopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the
second ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now
runs.Spencer Catherwood had
built two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at
the side, and the brick stable and stable yard.As Stephen approached
it, the thought came to him how little this world's goods avail in times
of trouble.One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching
regiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken
his doors.Another was in Clarence Colfax's company of dragoons, and
still another had fled southward the night after Sumter.Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the
new-turned street, to gaze westward.Clouds were gathering in the sky,
but the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines
had crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the
glint of the sun on rifle barrels.Directed by a genius in the art of
war, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who
hurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano.They came
through the wide-shuttered window above his head.Then a girl's voice
rose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--

       "Away down South in de fields of cotton,
        Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,
        Look away, look away, Look away, look away.Den I wish I was in Dixie's Land,
        Oh, oh!In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
        And live and die in Dixie's Land.The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter.Jinny Carvel, how dare you!""We
shall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here."Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods' coachman, came out of the stable yard.The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror.Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:

"Mistah Brice, if de Dutch take Camp Jackson, is we <DW65>s gwinter be
free?"Stephen did not answer, for the piano had started again,

       "If ever I consent to be married,
        And who could refuse a good mate?The man whom I give my hand to,
        Must believe in the Rights of the State."Then the blinds were flung aside, and a young lady in
a dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window, smiling.For an
instant she stared at him, and then turned to the girls crowding behind
her.What she said, he did not wait to hear.THE TENTH OF MAY

Would the sons of the first families surrender, "Never!"cried a young
lady who sat behind the blinds in Mrs.It seemed to
her when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle
that the tumult in her heart would drown their roar."But, Jinny," ventured that Miss Puss Russell who never feared to speak
her mind, "it would be folly for them to fight.The Dutch and Yankees
outnumber them ten to one, and they haven't any powder and bullets.""And Camp Jackson is down in a hollow," said Maude Catherwood,
dejectedly.And yet hopefully, too, for at the thought of bloodshed she
was near to fainting."Oh," exclaimed Virginia, passionately, "I believe you want them to
surrender.I should rather see Clarence dead than giving his sword to a
Yankee."At that the other two were silent again, and sat on through an endless
afternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room.Catherwood's heavy step was heard as he paced the hall.From time to time they glanced at Virginia, as if to fathom her
thought.She and Puss Russell had come that day to dine with Maude.Catherwood's Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the
marching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of
this the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel's regiment.It was
Virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of
the troops, and the crowd had cheered her.It was Virginia who flew to
the piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration
of the girls and the delight of Mr.Catherwood who applauded her spirit
despite the trouble which weighed upon him.Once more the crowd had
cheered,--and hesitated.But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive,
and the people followed.Virginia remained at the piano, her mood exalted patriotism, uplifted
in spirit by that grand song.At first she had played it with all her
might.She laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers
she had seen.A million of these, with all the firearms in the world,
could not prevail against the flower of the South.Then she had begun
whimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before, and
suddenly her exaltation was fled, and her fingers left the keys.Gaining
the window, trembling, half-expectant, she flung open a blind.The troops, the people, were gone, and there alone in the road
stood--Stephen Brice.The others close behind her saw him, too, and Puss
cried out in her surprise.The impression, when the room was dark once
more, was of sternness and sadness,--and of strength.Effaced was the
picture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and ill-fitting
uniforms of blue.Not a word escaped her, nor could they tell
why--they did not dare to question her then.An hour passed, perhaps
two, before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below.They heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement, and the cry
repeated.Bitter before, now was she on fire.Close her lips as tightly as she might, the tears forced themselves to
her eyes.How hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling.The girls gathered around her, pale and frightened and anxious.Suddenly
courage returned to her, the courage which made Spartans of Southern
women.Catherwood was on the sidewalk,
talking to a breathless man.Barbo, Colonel Carvel's
book-keeper."Yes," he was saying, "they--they surrendered.There was nothing else
for them to do.Catherwood from a kind of stupor."Virginia, we shall make them smart for this yet, My God!"he cried,
"what have I done that my son should be a traitor, in arms against his
own brother fighting for his people?To think that a Catherwood should
be with the Yankees!You, Ben," he shouted, suddenly perceiving an
object for his anger."What do you mean by coming out of the yard?By
G-d, I'll have you whipped.I'll show you <DW65>s whether you're to be
free or not."Catherwood was a good man, who treated his servants well.Suddenly he dropped Virginia's hand and ran westward down the hill.Well
that she could not see beyond the second rise.Let us stand on the little mound at
the northeast of it, on the Olive Street Road, whence Captain Lyon's
artillery commands it.Davis Avenue is
no longer a fashionable promenade, flashing with bright dresses.Those
quiet men in blue, who are standing beside the arms of the state troops,
stacked and surrendered, are United States regulars.They have been in
Kansas, and are used to scenes of this sort.The five Hessian regiments have surrounded the camp.Each commander
has obeyed the master mind of his chief, who has calculated the time
of marching with precision.Here, at the western gate, Colonel Blair's
regiment is in open order.See the prisoners taking their places between
the ranks, some smiling, as if to say all is not over yet; some with
heads hung down, in sulky shame.Still others, who are true to the
Union, openly relieved.But who is this officer breaking his sword to
bits against the fence, rather than surrender it to a Yankee?Listen to
the crowd as they cheer him.Listen to the epithets and vile names which
they hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors, "Mudsills!""<DW64>
Worshippers."Yes, the crowd is there, seething with conflicting passions.Men with
brows bent and fists clenched, yelling excitedly.Others pushing, and
eager to see,--there in curiosity only.And, alas, women and children
by the score, as if what they looked upon were not war, but a parade,
a spectacle.As the gray uniforms file out of the gate, the crowd has
become a mob, now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road,
now pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and
corporals.Listen to them calling to sons, and brothers, and husbands in
gray!See, there is a woman who spits in a soldier's face!Throughout it all, the officers sit their horses, unmoved.A man on the
bank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain.A German private steps
from the ranks, forgetful of discipline, and points at the man, who is
cursing the captain's name.The captain, imperturbable, orders his man
back to his place.Now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two
files of it.A band (one of those which played lightsome music on the
birthday of the camp) is marched around to the head of the column.The
regiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of
regulars, amid imprecations and cries of "Hurrah for Jeff Davis!"Stephen Brice stood among the people in Lindell's Grove, looking up at
the troops on the road, which was on an embankment.Through the rows of
faces he had searched in vain for one.His motive he did not attempt
to fathom--in truth, he was not conscious at the time of any motive.He
heard the name shouted at the gate."Here they are,--the dragoons!Dismounted, at the head of his
small following, the young Captain walked erect.He did not seem to hear
the cheers.His face was set, and he held his gloved hand over the place
where his sword had been, as if over a wound.On his features, in his
attitude, was stamped the undying determination of the South.How those
thoroughbreds of the Cavaliers showed it!The
fire of humiliation burned, but could not destroy their indomitable
spirit.They were the first of their people in the field, and the last
to leave it.Historians may say that the classes of the South caused the
war; they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest
burden of the suffering.Twice that day was the future revealed to Stephen.Once as he stood
on the hill-crest, when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in
a window,--in her face.And now again he read it in the face of her
cousin.It was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that
were to come.In that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered.Surely there was no such feeling in the North as these
people betrayed.That most dangerous of gifts, the seeing of two
sides of a quarrel, had been given him.He
sympathized with the Southern people.They had befriended him in his
poverty.Why had he not been born, like Clarence Colfax, the owner of a
large plantation, the believer in the divine right of his race to rule?Would that his path had been as
straight, his duty as easy, as that of the handsome young Captain.Presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back
strangely familiar.The back belonged to a gentleman who was
energetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top
of which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse.The
gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a
newspaper tightly rolled in the other.Stephen smiled to himself when it
came over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr.William
T. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before.Somehow Stephen
was fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr.He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial.Then, almost
with one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and
handed it to the officer.Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken
ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through
the lines.Sherman slid down the
bank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen.A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and
he rolled at Mr.With a curse, he picked himself up,
fumbling in his pocket.There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from
before his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and
fall.It was the signal for a rattle of shots.Stones and bricks filled the
air, and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks.The regiment
quivered,--then halted at the loud command of the officers, and the
ranks faced out with level guns, Stephen reached for Mr.Sherman's boy,
but a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body.He contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the
mini-balls swished over their heads, and the leaves and branches began
to fall.Between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded
women and children, the groans and curses of men, and the stampeding of
hundreds.He was about to obey when a young; man, small and agile, ran past him
from behind, heedless of the panic.Stopping at the foot of the bank he
dropped on one knee, resting his revolver in the hollow of his left
arm.At the same time two of the soldiers above
lowered their barrels to cover him.When it
rolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground.He staggered to his feet with
an oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose
forehead was burned a black powder mark.he cried, reaching out wildly, "curse you, you d--d Yankee.Maddened, he made a rush at Stephen's throat.But Stephen seized his
hands and bent them down, and held them firmly while he kicked and
struggled.he panted; "curse you, you let me go and I'll kill
you,--you Yankee upstart!"One of the
officers, seeing the struggle, started down the bank, was reviled, and
hesitated."Let him go, Brice," he said, in a tone of command.Whereupon Brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground."Now see here, Jack," he said, picking it up, "I don't want to shoot
you, but I may have to.That young man saved your life at the risk of
his own.If that fool Dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a
wad, Mr.Brinsmade took one long look at Stephen,
turned on his heel, and walked off rapidly through the grove.And it may
be added that for some years after he was not seen in St.For a moment the other two stood staring after him.Sherman
took his boy by the hand.Brice," he said, "I've seen a few things done in my life, but
nothing better than this.Perhaps the day may come when you and I may
meet in the army.They don't seem to think much of us now," he added,
smiling, "but we may be of use to 'em later.If ever I can serve you,
Mr.Brice, I beg you to call on me."Sherman, nodding his head
vigorously, went away southward through the grove, toward Market Street.The dead were being laid in carriages, and the
wounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot.Stephen,
dazed at what had happened, took up the march to town.He strode faster
than the regiments with their load of prisoners, and presently he found
himself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of
Blair's men.It was then that he discovered that the prisoners' band in
front was playing "Dixie."They are climbing the second hill, and are coming now to the fringe
of new residences which the rich citizens have built.In the windows and on the steps of others women are
crying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners, some
of whom are gay, and others sullen.A distracted father tries to break
through the ranks and rescue his son.Ah, here is the Catherwood house.Catherwood, with her hand on her husband's arm, with
red eyes, is scanning those faces for the sight of George.Will the Yankees murder him for treason,
or send him North to languish the rest of his life?James has,
across the street, and is even now being carried into the house.Few
of us can see into the hearts of those women that day, and speak of the
suffering there.His face is cast down as
he passes the house from which he is banished.Nor do father, or mother,
or sister in their agony make any sound or sign.The
welcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him.The band is playing "Dixie" once more.George is coming, and some one
else.The girls are standing in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed,
their handkerchiefs in their hands.Some of the prisoners take off their
hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown
hair, who wears the red and white of the South as if she were born to
them.Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect
at the head of his dragoons.He gives her one look of entreaty, and that
smile which should have won her heart long ago.As if by common consent
the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her.How bravely she
waves at them until they are gone down the street!Then only do her eyes
fill with tears, and she passes into the house.Had she waited, she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line
of march and striding across to Pine Street.That night the sluices of the heavens were opened, and the blood was
washed from the grass in Lindell Grove.The rain descended in floods
on the distracted city, and the great river rose and flung brush from
Minnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee.Down in the long
barracks weary recruits, who had stood and marched all the day long,
went supperless to their hard pallets.Many a boy, prisoner or volunteer, sobbed
himself to sleep in the darkness.All were prisoners alike, prisoners
of war.Sobbed themselves to sleep, to dream of the dear homes that were
here within sight and sound of them, and to which they were powerless to
go.Sisters, and mothers, and wives were there, beyond the rain, holding
out arms to them.But what of
the long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side?What of
the children who ask piteously where their father is going, and who are
gathered by a sobbing mother to her breast?Where is the picture of that
last breakfast at home?So in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in
life comes the thought that, just one year ago, he who is the staff
of the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal,
before going to work in the office.Why had they not thanked God on
their knees for peace while they had it?See the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go
by.The sun shines, and the grass is green on the little plot, and the
geraniums red.Last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips,
watching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner.Her good
neighbors, the doctor and his wife, come in at the little gate to cheer
her.Why does God mock her with sunlight and
with friends?And that is his dear face, the second from the end.Look, he is smiling bravely, as if to say a thousand
tender things."Will, are the flannels in your knapsack?You have not
forgotten that medicine for your cough?"What courage sublime is that
which lets her wave at him?Well for you, little woman, that you cannot
see the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you.Oh, those guns
of Sumter, how they roar in your head!Ay, and will roar again, through
forty years of widowhood!Brice was in the little parlor that Friday night, listening to the
cry of the rain outside.Why
should she be happy, and other mothers miserable?The day of reckoning
for her happiness must surely come, when she must kiss Stephen a brave
farewell and give him to his country.For the sins of the fathers are
visited on the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate Him who is the Ruler of all things.The bell rang, and Stephen went to the door.That gentleman was suddenly aged, and his clothes were wet
and spattered with mud.He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits
and water which Mrs."Stephen," he said, "I have been searching the city for John.Did you
see him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?""I think not, sir," Stephen answered, with clear eyes."I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.""If you will excuse me,
madam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter.I have been able to
find no one who saw him."As he went out he glanced at Stephen's forehead.But for once in his
life, Mr.Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of
another."Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John," said his mother, when
the door was closed.IN THE ARSENAL

There was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel's house in Locust Street that
evening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a
pretence of eating.Addison Colfax had driven in
from Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash
the foam from her panting horses.She did not wait for Jackson to come
out with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage
to the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and
demand Clarence's release.Carvel assured her
it would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter
that claimed him.Could there be a more important matter than his
own nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch
butchers in the frenzy of their victory?Colfax shut herself up in
her room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down
to tea.The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness.With his hat on his head,
and his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room.He let his
cigar go out,--a more serious sign still.Finally he stood with his face
to the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown
of white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of
the state.Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her
father's back.If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for
that portrait.There was a light in her dark blue eyes.Underneath there
were traces of the day's fatigue.When she spoke, there was little life
in her voice."Aren't you going to the Planters' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and
tried to smile."I reckon not to-night, Jinny."To find out what they are going to do with Clarence," she said
indignantly."I reckon they don't know at the Planters' House," he said."Then--" began Virginia, and stopped."Then why not go to the Barracks?Order the carriage, and I will go with
you."He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes
his habit."Jinny," he said slowly, "Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?"The suddenness of the question took her breath.But she answered
steadily:

"Yes."Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father's gaze pierced to
her secret soul."Come here, my dear," he said.He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them.It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles
against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge.From
childhood she had been comforted there.Had she broken her doll, had
Mammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she
ill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman's inevitable
lot,--this was her sanctuary.This burden God Himself had sent,
and none save her Heavenly Father might cure it.Through his great love
for her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.Many times he strove to speak, and could not.But presently, as if
ashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on
the arm of his chair.By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well.What
he had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one."You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may
fail us.Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be.Our trade was
in the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay.Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be
prepared.""And did you think I would care, dear?""I can bear
with poverty and rags, to win this war.""His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them.Jackson came in on
tiptoe, and hesitated.At the Colonel's motion he took away the china
and the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights
in the chandelier.He went out softly, and closed the door."Pa," said Virginia, presently, "do you trust Mr.He improved the business greatly before this trouble
came.And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.""Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as
he serves himself."I think you do him an injustice, my dear," answered the Colonel.But
uneasiness was in his voice."Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a
cent.He owns two slaves now who are running the river.He keeps out of
politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults."Getting up, he went over to the
bell-cord at the door and pulled it."To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor.He smiled, and stooped to kiss her."Yes," he answered, "in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust
you, Jinny.And Lige's boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or
Sunday."The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly.A long line of boats lay idle,
with noses to the levee.Men stood on the street corners in the rain,
reading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands
lifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street.A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread.The Dutch had broken
up the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent
women and children.What might they not do to the defenceless city under
their victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South?Ladies who ventured out that day
crossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress.Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt's room.Three times
she knocked, and then she heard a cry within.Then the key was turned
and the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed
her aunt."Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!""I thought it was the
Dutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?""We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian," was the joyful answer."The
newspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free
to-day, on parole.Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them.The
whole state would have risen to their rescue."Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports.She permitted
her niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the
mirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there."I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long.I
am afraid I am going to have another of my attacks."I'll get it for you," said Virginia, used to her aunt's vagaries."It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a
comfortable night.""It must be a Yankee lie," said the lady.I saw them
torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians!I know he had to sleep
on a dirty floor with low-down trash.""But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!""Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr."Has he gone down to see
Clarence?""He went to Jefferson City last night," replied Virginia.Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news."Do you mean that he has deserted us?""That he has left us
here defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their
vengeance upon us women?If I were your
age and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal
now.I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even
if he is a Yankee.""I do not go on my knees to any man," she said."Rosetta, tell Ned I
wish the carriage at once."Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm."Your Pa would never forgive
me if anything happened to you."A smile, half pity, crossed the girl's anxious face."I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,"
she said, and left the room.His was one of the Union houses which
she might visit and not lose her self respect.Like many Southerners,
when it became a question of go or stay, Mr.Brinsmade's unfaltering
love for the Union had kept him in.Bell, and later
had presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings.In short, as a man of
peace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace.And now
that it was to be war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with
the Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could
not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy.He never hurt their
feelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work
which has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief
of suffering.He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and
many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and
Rebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of
perplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own
leaders.Brinsmade's own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that
gentleman himself standing on the threshold.He came down his steps
bareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as
he led her into the house.However such men may try to hide their own
trials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a
kindred nature.With the others, who are less generous, it matters
not.Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not
perceive that a trouble had come to this good man.Absorbed as she was
in her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence.The fire
left her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of
an enemy.Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the
drawing-room.From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw
her arms around her friend."Jinny, it was so good of you to come."Because we are Union," said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of
doubt."Anne," she cried, "if you were German, I believe
I should love you."I should not have dared go to your house,
because I know that you feel so deeply."That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think.Perhaps," she cried,
"perhaps he may be dead."She drew Anne to the sofa and
kissed her."No, he is not dead," she said gently, but with a confidence in her
voice of rare quality."He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have
heard."Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr.He
looked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those
whom he honored.A life of service to others had made him guess that,
in the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some
kind."Virginia is right, Anne," he said."John has gone to fight for his
principles, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember
that this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because
we think differently.""There is
something I can do for you, my dear?"And yet her honesty was as
great as Anne's.She would not have it thought that she came for other
reasons."My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came
to ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be
paroled.She thinks it is a--" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious
tongue.Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made.He
understood the girl, and admired her."I'll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny," he answered."I know
Captain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.""You will do nothing of the kind, sir," said Virginia, with emphasis."Had I known this--about John, I should not have come."What a gentleman of the old school
he was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye
kindling with charity."My dear," he answered, "Nicodemus is waiting.I was just going myself
to ask Captain Lyon about John."Virginia's further objections were cut
short by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a
tall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as
Major Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street
Railroad.He then proceeded, as was
evidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.Brinsmade," he said, "I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that
you were seeking news of your son.I regret to say, sir, that the news I
have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts.But in justice to
a young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened
at Camp Jackson."With
some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story,
he gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr.John's arrival at the
embankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union
volunteers.Sherman did not believe in
mincing matters even to a father and sister."And, sir," said he, "you may thank the young man who lives next door to
you--Mr.Brice, I believe--for saving your son's life."Virginia felt Anne's hand tighten But her own was limp.A hot wave swept
over her, Was she never to hear the end of this man."Yes, sir, Stephen Brice," answered Mr."And I never in my life
saw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.""As sure as I know you," said the Major, with excessive conviction.Brinsmade, "I was in there last night, I knew the young
man had been at the camp.He told me
that he had, by the embankment.But he never mentioned a word about
saving his life.""By glory, but he's even better than I
thought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?""Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.""Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to
put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr.Brice, who was only
ten feet away, standing before your son."Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted.Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the
story.The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well.Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and
had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the
regiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how
Stephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.Had she any right to treat
such a man with contempt?She remembered hour he had looked, at her when
he stood on the corner by the Catherwoods' house.And, worst of all, she
remembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of
which had been that Mr.Brice was better at preaching than at fighting.She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the
greatest injustice she could have done him.It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major.Sherman,
apparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had
he not interfered.John would have
shot the man who saved his life.Brinsmade and Anne had
gone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told
Virginia, who kept it in her heart.The reason he told her was because
she had guessed a part of it.Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday,
in his own carriage.Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to
him to talk cheerily with her.He told her many little anecdotes of his
travel, but not one of them did she hear.Again, at the moment when she
thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she
found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter
young Bostonian.In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen's
deed was splendid.Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy.But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would
Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr.Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr.As if to aggravate her torture, Mr.Brinsmade's talk drifted to the
subject of young Mr.He told her of the
brave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and
often necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.Brinsmade, "often I have been unable to sleep, and
have seen the light in Stephen's room until the small hours of the
morning.""Can't you tell me something bad
about him?The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his
side, flushed and confused.Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what
he thought?How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after
they have caned us for them?We do not remember that our parents have
once been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings
a part of their past vividly before them.Brinsmade was silent, but
he looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia.And presently,
as they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of
gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city.Nicodemus stopped
at his master's signal.Here was George Catherwood, and his father was
with him."They have released us on parole," said George."Yes, we had a fearful
night of it.They could not have kept us--they had no quarters."How changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday!His bright uniform
was creased and soiled and muddy, his face unshaven, and dark rings of
weariness under his eyes."Do you know if Clarence Colfax has gone home?""Clarence is an idiot," cried George, ill-naturedly.Brinsmade, of
all the prisoners here, he refused to take the parole, or the oath of
allegiance.He swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged.""The young man is Quixotic," declared the elder Catherwood, who was not
himself in the best of humors.Brinsmade, with as much severity as he was ever known
to use, "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you.Nicodemus, you may drive on."Perhaps George had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage,
for he turned purple, and stood staring on the pavement after his
choleric parent had gone on.Of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld
the honor of their state that week, there was but the one who chose to
remain in durance vile within the Arsenal wall--Captain Clarence Colfax,
late of the Dragoons.Brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the Arsenal, and treated with the
respect which his long service to the city deserved.He and Virginia
were shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer, and
thither presently came Captain Lyon himself.Virginia tingled with
antagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble, who had
set an iron heel on the flaming brand of her Cause.He, too, showed the
marks of his Herculean labors, but only on his clothes and person.His
long red hair was unbrushed, his boots covered with black mud, and his
coat unbuttoned.His face was ruddy, and his eye as clear as though
he had arisen from twelve hours' sleep.He bowed to Virginia (not too
politely, to be sure).Her own nod of are recognition did not seem to
trouble him."Yes, sir," he said incisively, in response to Mr.Brinsmade's question,
"we are forced to retain Captain Colfax.He prefers to remain a prisoner
until he is exchanged.He refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the
United States."And why should he be made to, Captain Lyon?In what way has he opposed
the United States troops?""You will pardon me, Miss Carvel," said Captain Lyon, gravely, "if I
refuse to discuss that question with you."Colfax is a near relative of yours, Miss Carvel,"
the Captain continued."His friends may come here to see him during
the day.And I believe it is not out of place for me to express my
admiration of the captain's conduct.You may care to see him now--"

"Thank you," said Virginia, curtly."Orderly, my respects to Captain Colfax, and ask him if a he will be
kind enough to come in here.Brinsmade," said the Captain, "I
should like a few words with you, sir."And so, thanks to the Captain's
delicacy, when Clarence arrived he found Virginia alone.She was much
agitated She ran toward him as he entered the door, calling his name."Max, you are going to stay here?"Aglow with admiration, she threw herself into his arms.Now, indeed, was
she proud of him.Of all the thousand defenders of the state, he alone
was true to his principles--to the South.Within sight of home, he alone
had chosen privation.She looked up into his face, which showed marks of excitement and
fatigue.She knew that he could live on
excitement.The thought came to her--was it that which sustained him
now?Surely the touch of this experience
would transform the boy into the man.This was the weak point in the
armor which she wore so bravely for her cousin.He had known neither care nor
responsibility.His one longing from a child had been that love of
fighting and adventure which is born in the race.Until this gloomy
day in the Arsenal, Virginia had never characterized it as a love of
excitement---as any thing which contained a selfish element.She looked
up into his face, I say, and saw that which it is given to a woman only
to see.His eyes burned with a light that was far away.Even with his
arms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence, and that she
had come all the way to the Arsenal to see him.Her hands dropped limply
from his shoulders She drew away, as he did not seem to notice.Above and beyond the sacrifice of a woman's life, the
joy of possessing her soul and affection, is something more desirable
still--fame and glory--personal fame and glory, The woman may share
them, of course, and be content with the radiance.When the Governor
in making his inauguration speech, does he always think of the help the
little wife has given him.And so, in moments of excitement, when we see
far ahead into a glorious future, we do not feel the arms about us,
or value the sweets which, in more humdrum days, we labored so hard to
attain.Virginia drew away, and the one searching glance she gave him he did
not see.He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she
turned from him to look out over the Arsenal grounds, still wet and
heavy with the night's storm.She
thought of the supper cooking at home.And yet, in that moment of bitterness Virginia loved him.Such are the
ways of women, even of the proudest, who love their country too.It was
but right that he should not think of her when the honor of the South
was at stake; and the anger that rose within her was against those nine
hundred and ninety-nine who had weakly accepted the parole."He has gone to Jefferson City, to see the Governor.."

"And you came alone?"What a relief that should have come
among the first.She was
afraid," (Virginia had to smile), "she was afraid the Yankees would kill
you.""They have behaved very well for Yankees," replied he, "No luxury, and
they will not hear of my having a servant.They are used to doing their
own work.But they have treated me much better since I refused to take
their abominable oath.""And you will be honored for it when the news reaches town."Clarence asked eagerly, "I reckon they will
think me a fool!""I should like to hear any one say so," she flashed out."No," said Virginia, "our friends will force them to release you.But you have done nothing to be imprisoned
for.""I do not want to be
released.""You do not want to be released," she repeated.If I remain a prisoner, it will
have a greater effect--for the South."She smiled again, this time at the boyish touch of heroics.Experience,
responsibility, and he would get over that.She remembered once, long
ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and
he had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days.It was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with Mr.Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even
thought of hunger.Brinsmade was silent, leaning back in the corner
of the carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts.Drawing near
the city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them.A shot
rang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses.As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade.Down the vista of the street was a mass of
blue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of
the old Presbyterian Church Mr.Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the
carriage.The shots ceased, giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to
her heart that wet and lowering afternoon.Nicodemus tugging at the reins, and great splotches of
mud flying in at the windows.The roar of the crowd died to an ominous
moaning behind them.Brinsmade was speaking:--
"From battle and murder, and from sudden death--from all sedition, privy
conspiracy, and rebellion,--Good Lord, deliver us."He was repeating the Litany--that Litany which had come down through the
ages.They had chanted it in Cromwell's time, when homes were ruined and
laid waste, and innocents slaughtered.They had chanted it on the dark,
barricaded stairways of mediaeval Paris, through St.Bartholomew's
night, when the narrow and twisted streets, ran with blood.They had
chanted it in ancient India, and now it was heard again in the New World
and the New Republic of Peace and Good Will.The girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had
uttered in his prayers.Was she a traitor to that flag for which her
people had fought in three wars?She burned to blot it
forever from the book Oh, the bitterness of that day, which was prophecy
of the bitterness to come.Brinsmade escorted her up her own steps.He held her hand a little at parting, and bade her be of good cheer.Perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that
night alone with her aunt, Clarence's mother.Brinsmade did not go
directly home.He went first to the little house next door to his.Brice and Judge Whipple were in the parlor: What passed between them
there has not been told, but presently the Judge and Mr.Brinsmade came
out together and stood along time in, the yard, conversing, heedless of
the rain.THE STAMPEDE

Sunday dawned, and the people flocked to the churches.But even in the
house of God were dissension and strife.Posthelwaite's Virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and
walk out--their faces pale with anger.Mark's the prayer for
the President of the United States was omitted.Catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the South was
justified, and the sanction of Holy Writ laid upon her Institution.With not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of
brethren with whom they had labored for many years, save only when Mr.Brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return.So it is that war, like
a devastating flood, creeps insistent into the most sacred places, and
will not be denied.Davitt, at least, preached that day to an united
congregation,--which is to say that none of them went out.Hopper,
who now shared a pew with Miss Crane, listened as usual with a most
reverent attention.The clouds were low and the streets wet as people
walked home to dinner, to discuss, many in passion and some in sorrow,
the doings of the morning.A certain clergyman had prayed to be
delivered from the Irish, the Dutch, and the Devil.Was it he who
started the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon?Those
barbarians of the foreign city to the south, drunk with power, were to
sack and loot the city.How it flew across street and alley, from
yard to yard, and from house to house!Privileged Ned ran into the
dining-room where Virginia and her aunt were sitting, his eyes rolling
and his face ashen with terror, crying out that the Dutch were marching
on the city, firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts."De Gen'ral done gib out er procl'mation, Miss Jinny," he cried."De
Gen'ral done say in dat procl'mation dat he ain't got no control ober de
Dutch soldiers.""Oh Miss Jinny, ain't you gwineter Glencoe?Ain't you gwineter flee
away?Every fambly on dis here street's gwine away--is packin' up fo' de
country.Doan't you hear 'em, Miss Jinny?What'll your pa say to Ned of
he ain't make you clear out!Doan't you hear de carridges a-rattlin' off
to de country?"Virginia rose in agitation, yet trying to be calm, and to remember
that the safety of the household depended upon her alone.That was her
thought,--bred into her by generations,--the safety of the household,
of the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her
father's bounty.How she longed in that instant for her father or
Captain Lige, for some man's strength, to depend upon.She has seen her aunt swoon before,
and her maid Susan knows well what to do."Laws Mussy, no, Miss Jinny.One <DW65> laik me doan't make no
difference.My Marsa he say: 'Whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked
by de Dutch?'Oh Miss Jinny, you an' Miss Lill an' Mammy
Easter an' Susan's gwine with Jackson, an' de othah niggahs can walk.Ephum an' me'll jes' put up de shutters an' load de Colonel's gun."By this time the room was filled with excited <DW64>s, some crying,
and some laughing hysterically.Uncle Ben had come in from the kitchen;
Jackson was there, and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by
the sideboard.Old Ephum, impassive, and Ned stood together.Virginia's
eye rested upon them, and the light of love and affection was in it.Yes, carriages were indeed rattling outside, though
a sharp shower was falling.Across the street Alphonse, M. Renault's
butler, was depositing bags and bundles on the steps.M. Renault himself
bustled out into the rain, gesticulating excitedly.Spying her at the
window, he put his hands to his mouth, cried out something, and ran in
again.Virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound
of drums.Then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on
the lounge."O Jinny," murmured that lady, who had revived, "can't you do something?They will be here any moment to burn us, to
murder us--to--oh, my poor boy!Why isn't he here to protect his mother!Why was Comyn so senseless, so thoughtless, as to leave us at such a
time!""I don't think there is any need to be frightened," said Virginia, with
a calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger."It is probably only a
rumor.Brinsmade's and ask him about it."However loath to go, Ned departed at once.All honor to those old-time
<DW64>s who are now memories, whose devotion to their masters was next
to their love of God.A great fear was in Ned's heart, but he went.And he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any
more.Colfax is summoning
that courage which comes to persons of her character at such times.She
gathers her jewels into a bag, and her fine dresses into her trunk,
with trembling hands, although she is well enough now.The picture of
Clarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown.No,
she will not go to Bellegarde.With frantic
haste she closes the trunk, which Ephum and Jackson carry downstairs and
place between the seats of the carriage.Ned had had the horses in it
since church time.It is three in the afternoon, and Jackson explains that,
with the load, they would not reach there until midnight, if at all.Yes; many of the first families live there,
and would take them in for the night.Equipages of all sorts are
passing,--private carriages and public, and corner-stand hacks.The
black drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses.Pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms, some running
east, and some west, and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances
of each direction.From the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats
breaking the Sabbath stillness there.Virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps, watching the
scene, and waiting for Ned to return from Mr.Her face was
troubled, as well it might be.The most alarming reports were cried up
to her from the street, and she looked every moment for the black smoke
of destruction to appear to the southward.Around her were gathered the
Carvel servants, most of them crying, and imploring her not to leave
them.Colfax's trunk was brought down and placed in the
carriage where three of them might have ridden to safety, a groan of
despair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her
heart."Miss Jinny, you ain't gwineter leave yo' ol mammy?""Hush, Mammy," she said."No, you shall all go, if I have to stay
myself.Ephum, go to the livery stable and get another carriage."She went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she
would take with her--the little jewellery case with the necklace of
pearls which her great-grandmother had worn at her wedding.Rosetta and
Mammy Easter were of no use, and she had sent them downstairs again.With a flutter she opened her wardrobe door, to take one last look at
the gowns there.They were part of happier days
gone by.She fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the
bottom, and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged
to Dorothy Manners.A tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays.Irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of Anne's fancy dress
ball,--of the episode by the gate, upon which she had thought so often
with burning face.The voices below grow louder, but she does not hear.She is folding the
gown hurriedly into a little package.It was her great-grandmother's;
her chief heirloom after the pearls.Silk and satin from Paris are
left behind.With one glance at the bed in which she had slept since
childhood, and at the picture over it which had been her mother's, she
hurries downstairs.And Dorothy Manners's gown is under her arm.On the
landing she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief.Ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the
steps behind the <DW64>s.Crimson stains were on Virginia's cheeks,
and the package she carried under her arm was like lead.The young
man, although he showed no signs of excitement, reddened too as he came
forward and took off his hat.But the sight of him had acurious effect
upon Virginia, of which she was at first unconscious.A sense of
security came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his
voice.Brinsmade has gone to the hospital, Miss Carvel," he said.Brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that I might
persuade you to stay where you are.""Then the Germans are not moving on the city?"It was that smile that angered her,
that made her rebel against the advice he had to offer; that made her
forget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there.For she
believed him utterly, without reservation.The moment he had spoken she
was convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for
merriment in future years.And yet--was not that smile in derision of
herself--of her friends who were running away?Was it not an assumption
of Northern superiority, to be resented?"It is only a malicious rumor, Miss Carvel," he answered."You have
been told so upon good authority, I suppose," she said dryly.And at the
change in her tone she saw his face fall."I have not," he replied honestly, "but I will submit it to your own
judgment.Yesterday General Harney superseded Captain Lyon in command
in St.Some citizens of prominence begged the General to send the
troops away, to avoid further ill-feeling and perhaps--bloodshed."(They
both winced at the word.)"Colonel Blair represented to the General that
the troops could not be sent away, as they had been enlisted to serve
only in St.Louis; whereupon the General in his proclamation states that
he has no control over these Home Guards.That sentence has been twisted
by some rascal into a confession that the Home Guards are not to be
controlled.I can assure you, Miss Carvel," added Stephen, speaking
with a force which made her start and thrill, "I can assure you from a
personal knowledge of the German troops that they are not a riotous lot,
and that they are under perfect control.If they were not, there are
enough regulars in the city to repress them."And she was silent, forgetful of the hub-bub around her.It
was then that her aunt called out to her, with distressing shrillness,
from the carriage:-- "Jinny, Jinny, how can you stand there talking to
young men when our lives are in danger?"She glanced hurriedly at Stephen, who said gently; "I do not wish to
delay you, Miss Carvel, if you are bent upon going."His tone was not resentful, simply quiet.Ephum turned the
corner of the street, the perspiration running on his black face."Miss Jinny, dey ain't no carridges to be had in this town.This was the occasion for another groan from the <DW64>s, and they began
once more to beseech her not to leave them.In the midst of their cries
she heard her aunt calling from the carriage, where, beside the trunk,
there was just room for her to squeeze in."Jinny," cried that lady, frantically, "are you to go or stay?The
Hessians will be here at any moment.Oh, I cannot stay here to be
murdered!"Unconsciously the girl glanced again at Stephen.He had not gone, but
was still standing in the rain on the steps, the one figure of strength
and coolness she had seen this afternoon.Distracted, she blamed the
fate which had made this man an enemy.How willingly would she have
leaned upon such as he, and submitted to his guidance.Unluckily at
that moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any
other day, and was, in truth, ludicrous to Stephen then.At the head
of it was a little gentleman with red mutton-chop whiskers, hatless, in
spite of the rain beginning to fall.His face was the very caricature of
terror.His clothes, usually neat, were awry, and his arms were full
of various things, not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent
bronze clock.It was this object that caught Virginia's eye.But years
passed before she laughed over it.Cluyme (for it was he)
trotted his family.Cluyme, in a pink wrapper, carried an armful
of the family silver; then came Belle with certain articles of feminine
apparel which need not be enumerated, and the three small Cluymes of
various ages brought up the rear.Cluyme, at the top of his speed, was come opposite to the carriage
when the lady occupant got out of it.Clutching at his sleeve, she
demanded where he was going.His wife coming after
him had a narrower escape still.Colfax retained a handful of lace
from the wrapper, the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright."Virginia, I am going to the river," said Mrs."No, indeedy, Miss Lilly, I ain't a-gwine 'thout
young Miss.The Dutch kin cotch me an' hang me, but I ain't a-gwine
'thout Miss Jinny."Colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity."Ill as I am, I shall walk.Bear
witness that I have spent a precious hour trying to save you.If I live
to see your father again, I shall tell him that you preferred to stay
here and carry on disgracefully with a Yankee, that you let your own
aunt risk her life alone in the rain.She did not run down the steps, but she caught
her aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces.The girl's face
frightened Mrs.Colfax into submission, and she let herself be led back
into the carriage beside the trunk.Colfax's stung
Stephen to righteous anger and resentment--for Virginia.As to himself, he had looked for insult.He turned to go that he might
not look upon her confusion; and hanging on the resolution, swung on his
heel again, his eyes blazeing.He saw in hers the deep blue light of
the skies after an evening's storm.She was calm, and save for a little
quiver of the voice, mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of
cowering servants."Mammy," she said, "get up on the box with Ned.And, Ned, walk the
horses to the levee, so that the rest may follow.Ephum, you stay here
with the house, and I will send Ned back to keep you company."With these words, clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her
arm, she stepped into the carriage.Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer
admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door."If I can be of any service, Miss Carvel," he said, "I shall be happy."And as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face.Down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by
the driving rain.The drops pelted the chocolate water into froth, and a
blue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the Illinois bottom-lands.Down
on the Levee rich and poor battled for places on the landing-stages, and
would have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats
to save them from the dreaded Dutch.Attila and his Huns were not
more feared.What might not its
Barbarians do when roused?The rich and poor struggled together; but
money was a power that day, and many were pitilessly turned off because
they did not have the high price to carry them--who knew where?Boats which screamed, and boats which had a dragon's roar were backing
out of the close ranks where they had stood wheel-house to wheel-house,
and were dodging and bumping in the channel.See, their guards are black
with people!Colfax, when they are come out of the narrow street
into the great open space, remarks this with alarm.All the boats will
be gone before they can get near one.She
is thinking of other things than the steamboats, and wondering whether
it had not been preferable to be killed by Hessians.Vance, is
a friend of the family.What a mighty contempt did Ned and his kind have
for foot passengers!Laying about him with his whip, and shouting at the
top of his voice to make himself heard, he sent the Colonel's Kentucky
bays through the crowd down to the Barbara's landing stage, the people
scampering to the right and left, and the Carvel servants, headed by
Uncle Ben, hanging on to the carriage springs, trailing behind.He will tell you to this day how
Mr.Catherwood's carriage was pocketed by drays and bales, and how Mrs.James's horses were seized by the bridles and turned back.Ned had a
head on his shoulders, and eyes in his head.He spied Captain Vance
himself on the stage, and bade Uncle Ben hold to the horses while he
shouldered his way to that gentleman.The result was that the Captain
came bowing to the carriage door, and offered his own cabin to the
ladies.But the <DW65>s---he would take no <DW65>s except a maid for
each; and he begged Mrs.Colfax's pardon--he could not carry her trunk.So Virginia chose Mammy Easter, whose red and yellow turban was awry
from fear lest she be left behind and Ned was instructed to drive the
rest with all haste to Bellegarde.Colfax his
arm, and Virginia his eyes.He escorted the ladies to quarters in the
texas, and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was
cast off.It was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any
man on the river, which was no mean reputation.Colfax was assisted to bed by Susan.Virginia stood by the little
window of the cabin, and as the Barbara paddled and floated down the
river she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration.Nay, in that
hour she wished that the city might burn.So it is that the best of us
may at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be
fed.Virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet,
gray clouds.Passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the
humiliation she had suffered,--and before him, of all men.Could she
ever live with her aunt after what she had said?"Carrying on with that
Yankee!"Her anger, too, was still against Stephen.Once more he had been sent by
circumstances to mock her and her people.If the city would only burn,
that his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken, his calmness for
once broken!The rain ceased, the clouds parted, and the sun turned the muddy river
to gold.The bluffs shone May-green in the western flood of light, and a
haze hung over the bottom-lands.Not a sound disturbed the quiet of
the city receding to the northward, and the rain had washed the pall
of smoke from over it.On the boat excited voices died down to natural
tones; men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck,
as if this were some pleasant excursion.Women waved to the other boats
flocking after.Colfax stirred in
her berth and began to talk.Virginia did not move

"Jinny!"In that hour she remembered that great good-natured man, her
mother's brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much
from his wife's sister in-law.She could pass over, but never forgive
what her aunt had said to her that afternoon.Colfax had often been
cruel before, and inconsiderate.But as the girl thought of the speech,
staring out on the waters, it suddenly occurred to her that no lady
would have uttered it.In all her life she had never realized till now
that her aunt was not a lady.From that time forth Virginia's attitude
toward her aunt was changed.She controlled herself, however, and answered something, and went out
listlessly to find the Captain and inquire the destination of the boat.At the foot of the companionway
leading to the saloon deck she saw, of all people, Mr.Eliphalet Hopper
leaning on the rail, and pensively expectorating on the roof of the
wheel-house.In another mood Virginia would have laughed, for at sight
of her he straightened convulsively, thrust his quid into his cheek, and
removed his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually
accorded to the sex.Clearly Eliphalet would not have chosen the
situation."I cal'late we didn't get out any too soon, Miss Carvel," he remarked,
with a sad attempt at jocoseness."There won't be a great deal in that
town when the Dutch get through with it.""I think that there are enough men left in it to save it," said
Virginia.Hopper found no suitable answer to this, for he made
none.He continued to glance at her uneasily.There was an impudent
tribute in his look which she resented strongly."He's down below--ma'am," he replied."Yes," she said, with abrupt maliciousness, "you may tell me where you
are going.""I cal'late, up the Cumberland River.That's where she's bound for,
if she don't stop before she gets there Guess there ain't many of 'em
inquired where she was goin', or cared much," he added, with a ghastly
effort to be genial."I didn't see any use in gettin' murdered, when I couldn't do anything."He stared after her up the companionway, bit off a
generous piece of tobacco, and ruminated.If to be a genius is to
possess an infinite stock of patience, Mr.But it was not a pleasant smile to look upon.She had told her aunt the news, and stood
in the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward, with her hand
shading her eyes.The 'Barbara Lane' happened to be a boat with a
record, and her name was often in the papers.She had already caught up
with and distanced others which had had half an hour's start of her, and
was near the head of the procession.Virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in
knots, gazing at a boat coming toward them.Others had been met which,
on learning the dread news, turned back.But this one kept her bow
steadily up the current, although she had passed within a biscuit-toss
of the leader of the line of refugees.It was then that Captain Vance's
hairy head appeared above the deck.he said, "if here ain't pig-headed Brent, steaming the
'Jewanita' straight to destruction.""Oh, are you sure it's Captain Brent?""If that there was Shreve's old Enterprise come to life again, I'd lay
cotton to sawdust that Brent had her.Danged if he wouldn't take her
right into the jaws of the Dutch."The Captain's words spread, and caused considerable excitement.On board
the Barbara Lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over
their panic, and these went in a body to the Captain and asked him to
communicate with the 'Juanita'.Whereupon a certain number of whistles
were sounded, and the Barbara's bows headed for the other side of the
channel.As the Juanita drew near, Virginia saw the square figure and clean,
smooth-shaven face of Captain Lige standing in front of his wheel-house
Peace crept back into her soul, and she tingled with joy as the bells
clanged and the bucket-planks churned, and the great New Orleans packet
crept slowly to the Barbara's side."You ain't goin' in, Brent?"At the sound of his voice Virginia could
have wept."The Dutch are sacking the city," said Vance.A general titter went along the guards, and Virginia blushed."I'm on my reg'lar trip, of course," said Vance.Out there on the sunlit
river the situation seemed to call for an apology."Seems to be a little more loaded than common," remarked Captain Lige,
dryly, at which there was another general laugh."If you're really goin' up," said Captain Vance, "I reckon there's a few
here would like to be massacred, if you'll take 'em."Brent; "I'm bound for the barbecue."While the two great boats were manoeuvring, and slashing with one wheel
and the other, the gongs sounding, Virginia ran into the cabin."Oh, Aunt Lillian," she exclaimed, "here is Captain Lige and the
Juanita, and he is going to take us back with him.It its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which Virginia
used to get her aunt up and dressed.That lady, when she had heard the
whistle and the gongs, had let her imagination loose.Turning her face
to the wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece
entered.A big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gang-plank
was thrown across.Captain Lige himself was at the other end.His face
lighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady
from the <DW64>'s arms, crying:

"Jinny!The stevedore's
services were required for Mammy Easter.And behind the burly shield
thus formed, a stoutish gentleman slipped over, all unnoticed, with a
carpet-bag in his hand It bore the initials E. H.

The plank was drawn in.The great wheels began to turn and hiss, the
Barbara's passengers waved good-by to the foolhardy lunatics who had
elected to go back into the jaws of destruction.Colfax was put
into a cabin; and Virginia, in a glow, climbed with Captain Lige to the
hurricane deck.There they stood for a while in silence, watching the
broad stern of the Barbara growing smaller."Just to think," Miss Carvel
remarked, with a little hysterical sigh, "just to think that some of
those people brought bronze clocks instead of tooth-brushes.""And what did you bring, my girl?"asked the Captain, glancing at the
parcel she held so tightly under her arm.He never knew why she blushed so furiously.THE STRAINING OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP

Captain Lige asked but two questions: where was the Colonel, and was
it true that Clarence had refused to be paroled?Though not possessing
over-fine susceptibilities, the Captain knew a mud-drum from a lady's
watch, as he himself said.In his solicitude for Virginia, he saw that
she was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few
days.So he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top
of the texas,--that sanctified roof where the pilot-house squats.The
girl clung to her bonnet Will you like her any the less when you know
that it was a shovel bonnet, with long red ribbons that tied under
her chin?"Captain Lige," she said, almost
tearfully, as she took his arm, "how I thank heaven that you came up the
river this afternoon!""Jinny," said the Captain, "did you ever know why cabins are called
staterooms?""Why, no," answered she, puzzled."There was an old fellow named Shreve who ran steamboats before Jackson
fought the redcoats at New Orleans.In Shreve's time the cabins were
curtained off, just like these new-fangled sleeping-car berths.The old
man built wooden rooms, and he named them after the different states,
Kentuck, and Illinois, and Pennsylvania.So that when a fellow came
aboard he'd say: 'What state am I in, Cap?'And from this river has the
name spread all over the world--stateroom.That's mighty interesting,"
said Captain Lige."Yea," said Virginia; "why didn't you tell me long ago.""And I'll bet you can't say," the Captain continued, "why this house
we're standing on is called the texas.""Because it is annexed to the states," she replied, quick a flash."Well, you're bright," said he."Old Tufts got that notion, when Texas
came in.Bill Jenks was Captain Brent's senior pilot.His skin hung on his face
in folds, like that of a rhinoceros It was very much the same color.His
grizzled hair was all lengths, like a worn-out mop; his hand reminded
one of an eagle's claw, and his teeth were a pine yellow.He greeted
only such people as he deemed worthy of notice, but he had held Virginia
in his arms."William," said the young lady, roguishly, "how is the eye, location,
and memory?"When this happened it was put in
the Juanita's log."So the Cap'n be still harpin' on that?"he said, "Miss Jinny, he's just
plumb crazy on a pilot's qualifications.""He says that you are the best pilot on the river, but I don't believe
it," said Virginia.He made a place for her on the leather-padded
seat at the back of the pilot house, where for a long time she sat
staring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre
pipes.The sun fell down, but his light lingered in the air above as the
big boat forged abreast the foreign city of South St.There
was the arsenal--grim despite its dress of green, where Clarence was
confined alone.Captain Lige came in from his duties below."Well, Jinny, we'll soon be
at home," he said."We've made a quick trip against the rains.""And--and do you think the city is safe?""Jinny, would
you like to blow the whistle?""I should just love to," said Virginia.Jenks's
directions she put her toe on the tread, and shrank back when the
monster responded with a snort and a roar.River men along the levee
heard that signal and laughed.The joke was certainly not on sturdy
Elijah Brent.An hour later, Virginia and her aunt and the Captain, followed by Mammy
aster and Rosetta and Susan, were walking through the streets of the
stillest city in the Union.All that they met was a provost's guard, for
St.Once in a while they saw the light of
some contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to
laugh.Out in the suburbs, at the country houses of the first families,
people of distinction slept five and six in a room--many with only a
quilt between body and matting.Little wonder that these dreamed of
Hessians and destruction.In town they slept with their doors open,
those who remained and had faith.Martial law means passes and
explanations, and walking generally in the light of day.Martial law
means that the Commander-in-chief, if he be an artist in well doing,
may use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetle-browed.No police
force ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provost's guard.Captain Lige sat on the steps of Colonel Carvel's house that night, long
after the ladies were gone to bed.The only sounds breaking the silence
of the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the
call of the corporal's relief.But the Captain smoked in agony until the
clouds of two days slipped away from under the stars, for he was trying
to decide a Question.Then he went up to a room in the house which had
been known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor.The next morning, as the Captain and Virginia sit at breakfast together
with only Mammy Easter to cook and Rosetta to wait on them, the Colonel
bursts in.He is dusty and travel-stained from his night on the train,
but his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his
daughter."Jinny," he cries as he kisses her, "Jinny, I'm proud oil you, my girl!You didn't let the Yankees frighten you--But where is Jackson?"And so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again, between
laughter and tears on Virginia's part, and laughter and strong language
on Colonel Carvel's.What--blessing that Lige met them, else the
Colonel might now be starting for the Cumberland River in search of his
daughter.The Captain does not take much part in the conversation, and
he refuses the cigar which is offered him."Lige," he says, "this is the first time to my knowledge.""I smoked too many last night," says the Captain.The Colonel sat down,
with his feet against the mantel, too full of affairs to take much
notice of Mr."The Yanks have taken the first trick--that's sure," he said."But I
think we'll laugh last, Jinny.The
state has got more militia, or will have more militia in a day or
two.We won't miss the thousand they stole in Camp Jackson.And I've got a few commissions right here," and he
tapped his pocket."Pa," said Virginia, "did you volunteer?""The Governor wouldn't have me," he answered."He said I was more good
here in St.The Colonel listened with
many exclamations, slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded.he cried, when she had finished, "the boy has it in him, after
all!They can't hold him a day--can they, Lige?"(No answer from the
Captain, who is eating his breakfast in silence.)"All that we have to
do is to go for Worington and get a habeas corpus from the United States
District Court.The Captain got up excitedly, his face
purple."I reckon you'll have to excuse me, Colonel," he said."There's a cargo
on my boat which has got to come off."And without more ado he left the
room.In consternation they heard the front door close behind him.And
yet, neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial
of the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts.The
Colonel smoked for a while, not a word escaping him, and then he patted
Virginia's cheek."I reckon I'll run over and see Russell, Jinny," he said, striving to
be cheerful.He stopped
abruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead."My God," he
whispered to himself, "if I could only go to Silas!"Colfax's lawyer, of whose politics it is not necessary to speak.There
was plenty of excitement around the Government building where his Honor
issued the writ.There lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with
Mr.Russell and Colonel Carvel and the lawyer and the Commissioner to
the Arsenal.They were admitted to the presence of the indomitable Lyon,
who informed them that Captain Colfax was a prisoner of war, and, since
the arsenal was Government property, not in the state.The Commissioner
thereupon attested the affidavit to Colonel Carvel, and thus the
application for the writ was made legal.These things the Colonel reported to Virginia; and to Mrs.Colfax, who
received them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that
Yankee ruffian would pay any attention to the Sovereign law which he
pretended to uphold; whether the Marshal would not be cast over the
Arsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ.This was not the language, but the purport, of the lady's questions.Colonel Carvel had made but a light breakfast: he had had no dinner,
and little rest on the train.But he answered his sister-in-law with
unfailing courtesy.He was too honest to express a hope which he did not
feel.He had returned that evening to a dreary household.During the
day the servants had straggled in from Bellegarde, and Virginia had had
prepared those dishes which her father loved.Colfax chose to keep
her room, for which the two were silently thankful.The Colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs, but
Virginia was not deceived.He would not see the yearning in her eyes as
he took his chair; he would not glance at Captain Lige's empty seat.She caught her breath when she saw that the
food on his plate lay untouched.He pushed his chair away, such suffering in his look as she had never
seen."Jinny," he said, "I reckon Lige is for the Yankees.""I have known it all along," she said, but faintly."My God," cried the Colonel, in agony, "to think that he kept it from me
I to think that Lige kept it from me!""It is because he loves you, Pa," answered the girl, gently, "it is
because he loves us."Virginia got up, and went softly around the
table."Yes," he said, his voice lifeless.But her courage was not to be lightly shaken."Pa, will you forbid him
to come here--now?"A long while she waited for his answer, while the big clock ticked out
the slow seconds in the hall, and her heart beat wildly."As long as I have a roof, Lige may come under
it."She did not ask him where he was
going, but ordered Jackson to keep the supper warm, and went into the
drawing-room.The lights were out, then, but the great piano that was
her mother's lay open.That wondrous
hymn which Judge Whipple loved, which for years has been the comfort
of those in distress, floated softly with the night air out of the
open window.Colonel Carvel heard it, and
paused.He did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top
of the levee bank, where the quaint stone houses of the old French
residents were being loaded with wares.He took a few steps back-up the
hill.Then he wheeled about, walked swiftly down the levee, and on to
the landing-stage beside which the big 'Juanita' loomed in the night.On
her bows was set, fantastically, a yellow street-car.Its unexpected appearance there had
served to break the current of his meditations.He stood staring at it,
while the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs
of wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps."That'll be the first street-car used in the city of New Orleans, if it
ever gets there, Colonel.""Reckon I'll have to stay here and boss the cargo all night.Want to
get in as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," the Captain
concluded significantly."You were never too busy to come for
supper, Lige.Captain Lige shot at him a swift look."Come over here on the levee," said the Colonel, sternly.They walked
out together, and for some distance in silence."Lige," said the elder gentleman, striking his stick on the stones, "if
there ever was a straight goer, that's you.You've always dealt squarely
with me, and now I'm going to ask you a plain question."I'm North, I reckon," answered the Captain, bluntly.It was a long time before he spoke again.The Captain waited
like a man who expects and deserve, the severest verdict."And you wouldn't tell me, Lige?"My God, Colonel," exclaimed the other, passionately, "how could I?I
owe what I have to your charity.But for you and--and Jinny I should
have gone to the devil.If you and she are taken away, what have I left
in life?I was a coward, sir, not to tell you.And yet,--God help me,--I can't stand by and see the nation go to
pieces.Your fathers fought that
we Americans might inherit the earth--" He stopped abruptly.Then he
continued haltingly, "Colonel, I know you're a man of strong feelings
and convictions.All I ask is that you and Jinny will think of me as a
friend--"

He choked, and turned away, not heeding the direction of his feet.The
Colonel, his stick raised, stood looking after him.He was folded in the
near darkness before he called his name.He came back, wondering, across the rough stones until he stood beside
the tall figure.Below them, the lights glided along the dark water."Lige, didn't I raise you?Haven't I taught you that my house was your
home?But--but never speak to me again of this night!Not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street.At the
sound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia,
with her hands out stretched, stood under the hall light."Oh, Pa, I knew you would bring him back," she said.OF CLARENCE

Captain Clarence Colfax, late of the State Dragoons, awoke on Sunday
morning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city.His conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies
who had thronged Beauregard and Davis avenues, and honest admiration
from the party which had broken up the camp.There were many doting parents, like Mr.Catherwood, whose boys had
accepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.But popular opinion, when once aroused, will draw a grunt from the most
grudging.We are not permitted, alas, to go behind these stern walls and discover
how Captain Colfax passed that eventful Sunday of the Exodus.We know
that, in his loneliness, he hoped for a visit from his cousin, and took
to pacing his room in the afternoon, when a smarting sense of injustice
crept upon him.And how was he to guess, as he
looked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats
swimming southward, that his mother and his sweetheart were there?On Monday, while the Colonel and many prominent citizens were busying
themselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release
Mr.Colfax, and so cleanse the whole body of Camp Jackson's defenders
from any, veiled intentions toward the Government, many well known
carriages drew up before the Carvel House in Locust Street to
congratulate the widow and the Colonel upon the possession of such a
son and nephew.There were some who slyly congratulated Virginia, whose
martyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long.Colfax
kept her room, and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with
her.When the last of the callers was gone, Virginia was admitted to her
aunt's presence."Aunt Lillian, to-morrow morning Pa and I are going to the Arsenal with
a basket for Max.Pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come
back with us.The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, and raised her hands in
protest, the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from
her white arms.she exclaimed, "when I can't walk to my bureau after that
terrible Sunday.No," she added, with conviction,
"I never again expect to see him alive.Comyn says they may release him,
does he?The girl went away, not in anger or impatience, but in sadness.Brought
up to reverence her elders, she had ignored the shallowness of her
aunt's character in happier days.Colfax's conduct carried
a prophecy with it.Virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the
years to come,--on the pain they were likely to bring with them from
this source--Clarence gone to the war; her father gone (for she felt
that he would go in the end), Virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial
in company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousin's mother.Ay, and more, fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry.The girl could scarcely bear the thought--through the hurry and swing of
the events of two days she had kept it from her mind.To-morrow he would be coming home
to her joyfully for his reward, and she did not love him.She was bound
to face that again and again.She had cheated herself again and again
with other feelings.She had set up intense love of country in the
shrine where it did not belong, and it had answered--for a while.She
saw Clarence in a hero's light--until a fatal intimate knowledge made
her shudder and draw back.Captain Lige's cheery voice roused her from below--and her father's
laugh.And as she went down to them she thanked God that this friend had
been spared to him.Never had the Captain's river yarns been better told
than at the table that evening.Virginia did not see him glance at the
Colonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face."I'm going to leave Jinny with you, Lige," said Mr."Worington has some notion that the Marshal may go to the Arsenal
to-night with the writ.she pleaded

The Colonel was taken aback.He stood looking down at her, stroking his
goatee, and marvelling at the ways of woman."The horses have been out all day, Jinny," he said, "I am going in the
cars.""I can go in the cars, too.""There is only a chance that we shall see Clarence," he went on,
uneasily."It is better than sitting still," cried Virginia, as she ran away to
get the bonnet with the red strings."Lige,--" said the Colonel, as the two stood awaiting her in the hall,
"I can't make her out.It was a long journey, in a bumping car with had springs that rattled
unceasingly, past the string of provost guards.The Colonel sat in the
corner, with his head bent down over his stick At length, cramped and
weary, they got out, and made their way along the Arsenal wall, past the
sentries to the entrance.The sergeant brought his rifle to a "port".Carver

"Captain Colfax was taken to Illinois in a skiff, quarter of an hour
since."Captain Lige gave vent to a long, low whistle.he exclaimed, "and the river this high!Before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of
the river, and a number of people hurried up excitedly.Worington, the lawyer, and caught him by the sleeve.Worington glanced at the sentry, and pulled the Colonel past the
entrance and into the street."They have started across with him in a light skiff----four men and a
captain.And a lot of us, who suspected
what they were up to, were standing around.When we saw 'em come down,
we made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to
stand back.""Cuss me if I understand him," said Mr."He told us to
disperse, and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they
sent him."Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," said the sentry,
and they started to walk toward the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel
together.Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm.In the
darkness he laid his big one over it."Don't you be frightened, Jinny, at what I said, I reckon they'll fetch
up in Illinois all right, if I know Lyon.There, there," said Captain
Lige, soothingly.She had endured more in
the past few days than often falls to the lot of one-and-twenty.He thought of the
many, many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears.He
might do that no more, now.There was the young Captain, a prisoner on
the great black river, who had a better right, Elijah Brent wondered, as
they waited in the silent street for the lonely car, if Clarence loved
her as well as he.It was vary late when they reached home, and Virginia went silently up
to her room.Colonel Carvel stared grimly after her, then glanced at his
friend as he turned down the lights.The eyes of the two met, as of old,
in true understanding.The sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning
when Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew
the lock and bolt on the front door.The street was still, save for
the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early
rounds.The chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the
entry for the newspaper.Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall.She sat long behind the curtains in her father's little library, the
thoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of
another day.Once she stole softly back to
the entry, self-indulgent and ashamed, to rehearse again the bitter and
the sweet of that scene of the Sunday before.She summoned up the image
of the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened
servants.She seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his
face, to hear again the clear-cut tones of his voice as he advised
her.Then she drew back, frightened, into the sombre library,
conscience-stricken that she should have yielded to this temptation
then, when Clarence--She dared not follow the thought, but she saw the
light skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night.If he were spared, she prayed for strength to
consecrate herself to him A book lay on the table, and Virginia took
refuge in it.And her eyes glancing over the pages, rested on this
verse:--

       "Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,
        That beat to battle where he stands;
        Thy face across his fancy comes,
        And gives the battle to his hands."The paper brought no news, nor mentioned the ruse to which Captain Lyon
had resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to Illinois.Newspapers were not as alert then as now.Colonel Carvel was off early
to the Arsenal in search of tidings.He would not hear of Virginia's
going with him.Captain Lige, with a surer instinct, went to the river.Twice Virginia was summoned to her aunt, and
twice she made excuse.It was the Captain who returned first, and she
met him at the door."He is alive," said the Captain, tremulously, "alive and well, and
escaped South."She took a step toward him, and swayed.For a
brief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great
armchair that was the Colonel's."Lige," she said, "--are you sure that this is not--a kindness?""No, Jinny," he answered quickly, "but things were mighty close.They struck out straight
across, but they drifted and drifted like log-wood.And then she began
to fill, and all five of 'em to bail.The
five soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the Arsenal.They
hunted all night, but they didn't find Clarence.And they got taken off
to the Arsenal this morning.""I knew that much this morning," he continued, "and so did your pa.But
the Andrew Jackson is just in from Memphis, and the Captain tells me
that he spoke the Memphis packet off Cape Girardeau, and that Clarence
was aboard.She picked him up by a miracle, after he had just missed a
round trip through her wheel-house."CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING A CAPITALIST

A cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from Carondelet
to North St.The crowds liked best to go to
Compton Heights, where the tents of the German citizen-soldiers were
spread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the
city's reservoir.Thence the eye stretched across the town, catching the
dome of the Court House and the spire of St.Away to the west,
on the line of the Pacific railroad that led halfway across the state,
was another camp.Then another, and another, on the circle of the fan,
until the river was reached to the northward, far above the bend.Within
was a peace that passed understanding,--the peace of martial law.Without the city, in the great state beyond, an irate governor had
gathered his forces from the east and from the west.Letters came and
went between Jefferson City and Jefferson Davis, their purport being
that the Governor was to work out his own salvation, for a while
at least.Louis, struck in a night by the fever of
militarism, arose and went to Glencoe.Prying sergeants and commissioned
officers, mostly of hated German extraction, thundered at the door
of Colonel Carvel's house, and other houses, there--for Glencoe was
a border town.They searched the place more than once from garret to
cellar, muttered guttural oaths, and smelled of beer and sauerkraut, The
haughty appearance of Miss Carvel did not awe them--they were blind
to all manly sensations.The Colonel's house, alas, was one of many in
Glencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place
toward which the feet of the young men strayed.Good evidence was
handed in time and time again that the young men had come and gone, and
red-faced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns, and implied
that Beauty had had a hand in it.Councils of war were held over the
advisability of seizing Mr.Carvel's house at Glencoe, but proof was
lacking until one rainy night in June a captain and ten men spurred up
the drive and swung into a big circle around the house.The Captain
took off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door, more gently than
usual.The Captain was given an
audience more formal than one with the queen of Prussia could have been,
Miss Carvel was infinitely more haughty than her Majesty.Was not the
Captain hired to do a degrading service?Indeed, he thought so as he
followed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals
as he opened a closet door or looked under a bed.He was a beast of the
field, of the mire.How Virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to
pass her!Her gown would have been defiled by his touch.And yet the
Captain did not smell of beer, nor of sauerkraut; nor did he swear in
any language.He did his duty apologetically, but he did it.He pulled
a man (aged seventeen) out from under a great hoop skirt in a little
closet, and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in
the Captain's face.Sandra went to the bedroom.This was little Spencer Catherwood, just home from a
military academy.Spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined Captain to the
headquarters, where he caused a little embarrassment.No damning
evidence was discovered on his person, for the pistol had long since
ceased to be a firearm.And so after a stiff lecture from the Colonel
he was finally given back into the custody of his father.Despite the
pickets, the young men filtered through daily,--or rather nightly.Presently some of them began to come back, gaunt and worn and tattered,
among the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of
thousands on the levee.And they took them (oh, the pity of it!)Lynch's slave pen, turned into a Union prison of
detention, where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send
their disorderly and insubordinate <DW65>s.They were packed away, as
the miserable slaves had been, to taste something of the bitterness
of the <DW64>'s lot.So came Bert Russell to welter in a low room whose
walls gave out the stench of years.How you cooked for them, and schemed
for them, and cried for them, you devoted women of the South!You spent
the long hot summer in town, and every day you went with your baskets
to Gratiot Street, where the infected old house stands, until--until one
morning a lady walked out past the guard, and down the street.She was
civilly detained at the corner, because she wore army boots.If you were a young lady of the proper principles
in those days, you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat, and stood
in line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent
young officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar.He had little time to be courteous.He was not to be dazzled by a bright
gown or a pretty face; he was indifferent to a smile which would have
won a savage.His duty was to look down into your heart, and extract
therefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you
loved ere he could be sent north to Alton or Columbus.My dear, you
wish to rescue him, to disguise him, send him south by way of Colonel
Carvel's house at Glencoe.At least, he will
have died for the South.First politics, and then war, and then more politics, in this our
country.Your masterful politician obtains a regiment, and goes to war,
sword in hand.He fights well, but he is still the politician.It
was not a case merely of fighting for the Union, but first of getting
permission to fight.Camp Jackson taken, and the prisoners exchanged
south, Captain Lyon; who moved like a whirlwind, who loved the Union
beyond his own life, was thrust down again.A mutual agreement was
entered into between the Governor and the old Indian fighter in command
of the Western Department, to respect each other.How Lyon chafed, and paced the Arsenal walks while he might have
saved the state.Then two gentlemen went to Washington, and the next
thing that happened was Brigadier General Lyon, Commander of the
Department of the West.Would General Lyon confer with the Governor of Missouri?Yes, the
General would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but
his Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the
General deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously
preserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,
deserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals."Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that
my Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops
into the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will
into, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of
Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in
any matter, however unimportant, I would" (rising and pointing in turn
to every one in the room) "see you, and you, and you, and you, and every
man, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried."Then, turning
to the Governor, he continued, "This means war.In an hour one of my
officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines."And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he
turned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and
clanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was
lying dead beside Wilson's Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he
would have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who
fought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,
and curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by
the river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments
on the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the
northwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through
the streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the
Battle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;
bright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,
and rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and
cried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to
be revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the
soul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like
the veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the
color-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of
the sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and
pushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim
lists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!"The City
of Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and
the following Confederate wounded (prisoners)."In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm
boats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now
bearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields
thousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,
gathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their
red cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,
walked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided
their faces.He wrung Richter's hand on the landing-stage.The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by."You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you," he said."Now" (and he shrugged his shoulders), "now have we many with no cares
to go.I have not even a father--" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who
was standing by, holding out a bony hand."God bless you, Carl," said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his
ears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as
she backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were
the gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the
edge of the landing.Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the
Judge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office
where the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door
behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book.No, it was
not Whittlesey, but Hardee's "Tactics."He shut it with a slam, and went
to Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested
citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about
face.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of
them.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the
wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments
passed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did
not often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known
to go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because
they were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,
nor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in
the night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,
too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his
master.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May
he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,
and which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind
of them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the
necessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than
Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.Hopper rose from
his chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it
uneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a
smile was on his face.Carvel's chair with
a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a
thought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper
which had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly
closed, as if in pain.Hopper," he said, "these Eastern notes are due this week, are they
not?""There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that
there is no money to pay them," said he, with a certain pompous attempt
at severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made
it as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those
contemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut
short many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked
out of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,
when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr."These notes cannot be met," he repeated, and his voice was near to
breaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the
partition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, "I cal'late these
notes can be met."The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell
to the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it."There isn't a bank in town
that will lend me money.I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who
can spare it, sir."Suavity was come upon
it like a new glove and changed the man.Now
he had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in
leather and mahogany offices."I will take up those notes myself, sir."cried the Colonel, incredulously, "You?"There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his
nature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not
beam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and
friendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and
unnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of
those who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we
are thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little
bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel
had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life
had been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation
that made him tremble."I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,
Colonel.Here followed an interval
of sheer astonishment to Mr."And you will take my note for the amount?"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face
the new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the
man was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.He reviewed
his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to
the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing
with which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige
and Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He
would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money
he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had
left the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those
Eastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern
gentleman.His house would bring nothing
in these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his
chin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the
third time stopped abruptly before him."Where the devil did you get this money, sir?""I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,"
he said."It don't cost me much to live.The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened."You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it."Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of
paper from a pigeonhole."These be some of my investments," he answered, with just a tinge of
surliness."I cal'late they'll stand inspection.I ain't forcing you to
take the money, sir," he flared up, all at once."I'd like to save the
business."He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save
God knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name
which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he
drew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed
them he spoke:

"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper," said he, "And as a business man
you must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St."One moment, sir," cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his
full height."Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or
your security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my
word is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.""I'm not afraid, Colonel," answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at
geniality.He was, in truth, awed at last."If you
were--this instant you should leave this place."He sat down, and
continued more calmly: "It will not be long before a Southern Army
marches into St."Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,
Mr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith.And if
Eliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here."Leave that to me, Colonel," he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that
business which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I
thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk
that day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those
notes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.It was the
signal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the
store; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld
Mr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands."Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,
befo'--befo' she done left us?"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading
voice."Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n
Lige?""Ephum," said the Colonel, sadly, "I had a letter from the Captain
yesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in
Yankee pay."Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, "But de Cap'n's yo' friend,
Marse Comyn.He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn.He ain't in de army, suh.""And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum," answered the Colonel, quietly."But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments."Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that
night.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many
halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the
city.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the
entrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol
shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States
Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and
fingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion
and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market
House.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the
battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a
while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,
unnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into
Mr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out
of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned."Wal, I jest reckon," is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the
appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of
genteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and
his face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was
lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes."Hullo, Ford," he said, jocularly."Howdy, Cap," retorted the other."Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,
fo' sure.Gov'ment
ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon."Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face
that the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously
at the new line of buttons on his chest."I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time," said he."Wal, I jest reckon," asserted Mr."Cap'n
Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.Hopper,
Cap'n Wentworth.""You interested in
mules, Mr."I don't cal'late to be," said.Let us hope that our worthy
has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He
grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,
"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?""It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all
day in the sun."Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,
that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down
town.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,
it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by
Mr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that
the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart
people a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor
smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly
air, Mr.Hopper turns to Ford--"Don't lose no time in presenting them
vouchers at headquarters," says he.And
there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we
have an investigation, we'll whistle.He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but
his face is not a delight to look upon, "Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich
man some day."And because I ain't got no capital, I only get
four per cent.""Don't one-twenty a day suit you?"And you've got horse contracts, and
blanket contracts besides.What's to prevent my goin' south
when the vouchers is cashed?""Then your mother'll have
to move out of her little place."NEWS FROM CLARENCE

The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the
Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine.Thousands of our population, by the
sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment.When gaunt
famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should
inquire the cause.Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that
abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.'The wheels of
fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time.Let
us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of
the guillotine.But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape
without a little pity for the aristocrats?Do you think that many of
them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into
their homes!Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they
sat at breakfast, "why do you persist it wearing that old gown?It has
gotten on my nerves, my dear.You really must have something new made,
even if there are no men here to dress for.""Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things.I do not think that I ever
dressed to please men.""Tut, tut; my dear, we all do.We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of
fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for
a visit this autumn?I am having a fitting at
Miss Elder's to-day."She did not reply as she poured out her
aunt's coffee."Jinny," said that lady, "come with me to Elder's, and I will give you
some gowns.If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine,
you could dress decently.""I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian," answered the girl."I do
not need the gowns.Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I
can use it for a better purpose."Colfax arranged her lace pettishly."I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.""Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow
night."But you have no idea where
Clarence is."exclaimed her aunt, "I would not trust him.How do you know
that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army?Wasn't
Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's
to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?"She laughed at the
recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too."Puss hasn't been
around much since.I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks
of people.""I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and
Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment," Mrs.Colfax
went on, "It won't be long now.""Oh, you can't have read the papers.And don't you remember the letter
Maude had from George?They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt
Lillian.And half of Price's men have no arms at all."Colfax, "bring me a newspaper."All we know is that Lyon has left
Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming,
Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day."Colfax burst into tears, "Oh, Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so
cruel!"That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly
eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed
a letter to Mrs.In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand
another, in a "Jefferson Davis" envelope, and she thrust it in her
gown--the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen
Clarence, and that he was well.In two days an answer might be left
at Mr.But she must be careful what she wrote, as the
Yankee scouts were active.Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man.Glory and uniform became
him well, but danger and deprivation better.The words he had written,
careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride.Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when
the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the
captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had
floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had
contrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by.And how by a
miracle the moon had risen.When the great Memphis packet bore down upon
him, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of;
and set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into
trouble.In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing
himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife.Virginia
would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this
guise.The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties
from date to date.For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains
and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of
resistance in Missouri.Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living
on greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade
(so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where
the bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's
orders.Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the
Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and
that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville.Footsore,
but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was
retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad
a plight as himself.They travelled together, until one day some rough
farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders
of a creek and arrested all three for Union spies.Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper
captain of the State Dragoons.His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good
Southerners), likewise laughed when Mr.Colfax and the two others were
brought before him.His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp
which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.Louis in butternuts and
rawhide boots?""Give me a razor," demanded Clarence, with indignation, "a razor and a
suit of clothes, and I will prove it."A suit of clothes You know not what you ask."George Catherwood was
brought in,--or rather what had once been George.Now he was a big
frontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into
his trousers in place of a sword.He recognized his young captain of
dragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the
cabin.The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which
the Governor's soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way
south, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who
were their images.This was Price's army, but Price had gone ahead into
Kansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their
aid and save the state."Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have
   seen this country rabble.How you would have laughed, and cried,
   because we are just like them.In the combined army two thousand
   have only bowie-knives or clubs.Some have long rifles of Daniel
   Boone's time, not fired for thirty years.And the impedimenta are a
   sight.Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and
   even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and
   feather beds.But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen
   and Yankees just as we are.Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees
   haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under
   Colonel Rives.I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,
   Jefferson.Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we
   march into St."COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July."We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by <DW53> Creek and killed--we
   don't know how many.Tell Maude that George distinguished himself
   in the fight."We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers.We cheered
   until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold
   buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars.General McCulloch
   has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform.But how to
   clothe and feed and arm our men!We have only a few poor cattle,
   and no money.We shall whip the
   Yankees before we starve."Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which
her dear boy was forced to endure.He, who was used to linen sheets and
eider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the
best table in the state, was reduced to husks."But, Aunt Lillian," cried Virginia, "he is fighting for the South.If
he were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud
of him."Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to
Virginia.How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even
the candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away!He was happy,
though wretched because he could not see her.It was the life he had
longed for.he was proving his usefulness
in this world.He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden."Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would
   come of our not being able to work?How I wish you could see us
   felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,
   and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage.I can see
   you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us."It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew.Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began.Sad
to relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the
front,--those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which
were made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the
war, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers."Why should not our soldiers have them, too?"They were never so happy as when sewing on them against
the arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those
families separated from their dear ones by a great army.Clarence might
die, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were
brought a prisoner to St.How Virginia envied Maude because the
Union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother
Tom, at least!How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and
brothers were at the front, this privilege!We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to
be a spy was to be a patriot.Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon
countries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable.Compare, with a
prominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St.Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a
few people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille.Our own provost marshal was
hissed in the street, and called "Robespierre," and yet he did not fear
the assassin's knife.Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in
a Union city (their own city).No women were thrown into prison, it is
true.Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street
corner before the provost's guard.Once in a while a detachment of
the Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a
street and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear,
only to encounter another detachment in the alley.One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the
Carvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to
Virginia's room, the door of which she burst open.she cried, "Puss Russell's house is surrounded by Yankees,
and Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!"said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her
last year's bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red."Because," said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation "because they waved
at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen.Russell's house under guard--Puss had a
small--"

"Confederate flag," put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself."And she waved it between the shutters," Eugenie continued."And some
one told, the provost marshal.He has had the house surrounded, and the
family have to stay there.""Then," said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, "then each one of the
family is to have just a common army ration.They are to be treated as
prisoners.""Oh, those Yankees are detestable!"As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall
pay for it ten times over."She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with
its red and white ribbons, before the glass.Then she ran to the closet
and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings."Wait for me,
Genie," she said, "and we'll go down to Puss's house together.It may
cheer her to see us.""But not in that dress," said Eugenie, aghast.And her eyes flashed so
that Eugenie was frightened.Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from
beneath her black lashes.It was about five in the afternoon when they
started out together under Virginia's white parasol, Eugenie's slimmer
courage upheld by her friend's bearing.We must remember that
Virginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our
great-grandmothers experienced when the British held New York.It was
as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South.Elderly
gentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile
in admiration,--some sadly, as Mr.Young gentlemen found an
excuse to retrace their steps a block or two.But Virginia walked on
air, and saw nothing.She was between fierce anger and exaltation.She
did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard
in front of Puss Russell's house (these men were only human, after all);
she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the
corner, who could not resist a murmur of delight.The citizen sergeant
only smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white.Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.Russell won't let her," said Virginia,
disconsolately, "Genie, let's go to headquarters, and show this Yankee
General Fremont that we are not afraid of him."Eugenie's breath was taken away by the very boldness of this
proposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and
hero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came
back from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It
still stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and
very wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall
and broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by
elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.In short, the house is of that type built
by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best
stood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would
not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A
spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall
of dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,
security, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under
the black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven
the owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost
buried in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the
old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with
a sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and
west-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came
in sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk
was rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance.He had
just returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military
were wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our
army dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's
body-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street
before the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd
that feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern
military eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering
uniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,
and scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of
Southern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command
escaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of
the mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the
gate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put
foot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again
to be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,
who smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie's knees
trembled.She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony."Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn't
been so bold!""Hush," said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with
a look.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the
insolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces
of those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?"Oh, I hope he will arrest me," she said passionately, to Eugenie."He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell."No, those were not
the words, surely.He bowed very
low and said:

"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the
sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments."What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?But he was not
precipitate.Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing
which drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.And there she
stood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A
crowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers
in uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One
civilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the
gate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down
the side street.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,
startled her."May I have the pleasure," said that gentleman, "of accompanying you
home?"Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed."You must not come out of your way," she said."I am
sure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave
Eliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature
which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for
sweet girls; they cloyed.He
had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out
some of the vernacular."Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel," he answered, with a
shade of meaning."Then existence must be rather heavy for you," she said.She made
no attempt to introduce him to Eugenie."If we should have any more
victories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush," said
the son of Massachusetts."Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of
its stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton."Virginia turned quickly, "Oh, how dare you?""How dare you
speak flippantly of such things?"His suavity was far from overthrown."I assure you that I want to see the
South win."What he did not know was that words seldom convince women.But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time."Do
you cal'late," said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish
ruin to his country?""But you are a Yankee born," she exclaimed."There be a few sane Yankees," replied Mr.A remark
which made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a
smile.But much against her will he walked home with her.She was indignant by
the time she reached Locust Street.He had never dared do such a thing
before, What had got into the man?Was it because he had become
a manager, and governed the business during her father's frequent
absences?Hopper's politics, he would always be to
her a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides
almost bumped into them.He paused looked back, and bowed as if
uncertain of an acknowledgment.He had
been very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was
threadbare.When she looked again, he had covered half the block.Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr.Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his
enjoyment.It was part of the fruits of his reward.He wished in that
short walk that he might meet Mr.Cluyme and Belle, and every man and
woman and child in the city whom he knew.From time to time he glanced
at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a
bit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey.For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of
enjoyment in the progress of the game.Many and many a night in the bare
little back room at Miss Crane's, Eliphalet had gloated over the very
event which was now come to pass.Not a step of the way but what he had
lived through before.The future is laid open to such men as he.Since he had first seen the
black cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he
rehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place
a week before.A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for
this first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the
right to walk in her company.The words he had prepared--commonplace, to
be sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal
stream.The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after
a reason for it all.She brightened when she saw her father at the
doors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to
Eliphalet coldly."Why, bless us, Jinny," said the Colonel, "you haven't been parading the
town in that costume!You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow
night.laughed he, patting her under the chin, "there's no
doubt about your sentiments, anyhow.""I've been over to Puss Russell's house," said she, breathless."They've
closed it up, you know--" (He nodded.)"And then we went--Eugenie and I,
to headquarters, just to see what the Yankees would do.""You must take care, honey,"
he said, lowering his voice."They suspect me now of communicating with
the Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and
to stand by your colors.But this sort of thing," said he, stroking the
gown, "this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only
sets spies upon us.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes
standing in the alley last night for three hours.""Pa," cried the girl, "I'm so sorry."Suddenly searching his face with
a swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and
lined."Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must
not go off on any more trips.""It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant
duties--Jinny--"

"Yes?"The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still
standing at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as
Eliphalet pulled off his hat,

"Howdy, Colonel?"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen
by a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she
yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she
knew not what.Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly
as ever.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor."Won't--won't you come in, Mr.Virginia started

"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel," he answered; easily."I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter."Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,
she shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her
there.The man's face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself
on the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still
leering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,
she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the
stairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in
fear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,
heard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to
leave her father alone with him.Colfax
ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at
that lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed
what it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,
and gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's
pain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,
but preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a
guest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would
have given it to a governor."Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke," he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his
way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered."The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper," his landlady remarked, "where have you been so late?""I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea
with 'em," he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed's room later than usual that
night.THE SCOURGE OF WAR

"Virginia," said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, "I
am going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a
person as Comyn had here to tea last night."It is safe to say that she had never accurately
gauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection
for her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall
person of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not
what Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank
into a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had
thrust into her hand."There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek," said Virginia, in an
emotionless voice."General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we
should be thankful.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their
way here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from
Springfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to
eat or drink.""At what time shall I order the carriage
to take you to Bellegarde?"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown."Oh,
let me stay," she cried, "let me stay."As you please, Aunt Lillian," she answered."You know that you may
always stay here.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have
anything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it
before Pa."Oh, Jinny," sobbed the lady, in tears again, "how can you be so cruel
at such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for
Colonel Carvel's house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and
Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which
she had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at
Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed
back by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket
which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first
hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were
laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the
new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have
their hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun
reeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard
floor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were
the first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to
appal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed
on the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she
declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an
ordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the
waiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia
busy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed
eyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman's clothes,
stained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At
Virginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh
water, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe
some of the broth from Virginia's basket.For the first time since the
war began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the
questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged
the place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to
work in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have
been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down
the names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night
writing to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until
he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken
face.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that
rose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to
join her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while
in this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at
the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in
mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right
band.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,
thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the
girl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of
her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning
that he might listen:

"You have a wife?""A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.""I shall write to your wife," said the lady, so gently that Virginia
could scarce hear, "and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he
added, "God bless you, lady."Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned
her face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them
wet in her own.Nobility, character,
efficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large
features, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had
seen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her."Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man's pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head."He has
fainted," he said.The surgeon
smiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of
amputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,
a clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice," he said, "I shall be glad to get you permission
to take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and
then added, "We must have one more to help us.""I am afraid we must go, dear," he said, "your aunt is getting
impatient.""Won't you please go without me, Pa?""Perhaps I can be of
some use."The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went
away.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of
astonishment.Brice's searching gaze that brought the color
to the girl's, face."Thank you, my dear," she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the
carriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood
against the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude
and skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly
cut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough
bandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary
surgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to
him, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained
her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the
stairs on her father's arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, "God will reward you for this act.You have
taught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles."Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The
mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was
filled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice
was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with
hers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen's traits
seemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had
labored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His
work, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief
second had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished
him, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and
watch by the sergeant's pallet.Virginia's eyes followed her up the
stairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With
her foot on the step Virginia paused."Pa," she said, "do you think it would be possible to get them to let us
take that Arkansan into our house?""Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like," said the Colonel."Here he
comes now, and Anne."It was Virginia who put the question to him."My dear," replied that gentleman, patting her, "I would do anything
in the world for you.I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia," he added, soberly, "it is such acts as yours to-day that give
us courage to live in these times.""Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on
the face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to
him with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived
by the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to
throw out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had
had his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, "is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.""Even to an enemy," the General put in, "By George, Brinsmade, unless I
knew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,
he may have his Arkansan."Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not
say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview
his Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an
audience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent
in affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men
like Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows
in one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with
beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The
General might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions
of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was
a royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a
glittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that
these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of
thing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less
in communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all
their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two
hours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,
you discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the
General's fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and
worthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will
be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep
of security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We
shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army
of comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy
when it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the
Western Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women
who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with
truth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler
hero than he was never under a man's hand.For the glory of generals
fades beside his glory.Brice home from
her trying day in the hospital.Stephen, just returned from drill
at Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his
entreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the
porch behind the house, where there was a little breeze."Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen," she said."It was
while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost
his arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here."It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow," she said."I saw
the--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away
I had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind
me, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the
man, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get
help.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss
Carvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you
bought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that
they offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?""She is a wonderful creature," his mother continued.And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to
make?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them."The good
lady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her
capability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always
been a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must
it have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her
downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the
building, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something
to her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I
saw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that
place since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so
when I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such
politeness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,
and he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is
watched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating
with the Confederate leaders."I hope they will not get into any trouble.""I hope not, mother," said Stephen.It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the
Iron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards
drawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen
caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their
countrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran
on his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.Judge Whipple, grim
and silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when
the train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes
were piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of
Captain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill
where brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new
country and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a
hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the
great trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the
bugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,
stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first
of many to be laid on Richter's grave.And yet he had not filled it
with sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look
upon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the
earnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his
father before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their
bodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with
Father Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering
at sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant
Napoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,
his wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a
thankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder
man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In
Carl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.His, too,
had been the sacrifice.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate
that great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the
oppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY

One chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black
mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was
caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched
over them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were
pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a
man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his
feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a
ragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed
down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,
lay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the
surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of
others like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of
November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and
prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been
written.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when
they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls
of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found
time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his
correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and
midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already
overtaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains
of articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a 
print that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit
old clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas
was drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers
were unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,
and the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care
for the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and
the verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No."Inasmuch," said the General, "as the Secession army had driven these
people from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to
support them."He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent
"disloyalists" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten
thousand dollars."They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent," cried
Mr.Who were
to be on this mysterious list of "Sixty"?That was the all-absorbing
question of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous
ones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax
lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared
would break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,
gave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one
morning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the
newspaper:-- "For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well
to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand
dollar list.""Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when
you know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to
pay.We are the only women of importance in the city."That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to
Bellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were
left in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been
hired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,
long-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or
pacing the floor restlessly.He was observed
night and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to
conceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her
he would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of
the night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years
had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of
Christmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the
store, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily
into the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The
Captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he
would confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be
lighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of
apple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the
big parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his
Christmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house.Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss
them as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it
cannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood
looking out of the sitting-room window.A man's figure muffled in
a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had
seen the day before at Mr."Pa," she cried, "do you think he is coming here?""Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put
it in the garret."The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is."Then he added,
strangely enough for him, "God's will be done."And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with
his apron on."Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing
figure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came
out and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and
a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear
to relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from
his inner pocket a paper."Colonel Carvel," said he, "by order of Major General Halleck, I serve
you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars
for the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven
from their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such
personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will
satisfy the demand against you.""You may tell the
General that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my
right mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me."It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to
dinner.He had gone into many houses that week;
had seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women
whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their
loyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl
who had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his
eyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully
pulled his goatee, and laughed gently."Lordy, we haven't got three
hundred and fifty dollars to our names," said he.That fierce valley of the
Missouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is
sometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet
melts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock
deep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor
anything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,
accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States
Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,
watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who
came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his
French ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply
filling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance
hard to describe sat on her honest black face.I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me."An embarrassed
silence, and then from Mammy, "Whaffor you laffin at?""Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't.Ef he was, you ain't come here
'quirin' in dat honey voice.""You tink I
dunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an'
to steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n.You come heah when young Marse
ain't to home ter rob him.""Ned, whaffor you hidin'
yonder?Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over
Marse Comyn's gun."The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled
by this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it
was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort."Who is
you to come heah 'quiring fo' her!I ain't agwine--"

"Mammy!"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at
her bandanna."Mammy, what is all this noise about?""These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's
blongin's.I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body."He caught sight of the face of
Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly."I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize
personal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel."Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back."I do not see how
I am to prevent you," she said.I--I can't tell you how sorry I am.Then he
entered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around
him."I expect all that we want is right here," he said.And at the sight of
the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he
walked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany
stool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,
standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother's.It had once stood in the brick
house of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice
lay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.No more, of an evening
when they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play
them over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his
cigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl
who held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his
side.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had
played them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those
days, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter."Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey.Dis ain't no place for us,
I reckon."Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she
pronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders."Oh, de good
Lawd'll burn de wicked!"Virginia went back into the room
and stood before the deputy."Isn't there something else you could take?"I have a necklace--"

"No, miss.And there ain't nothing quite
so salable as pianos."She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and
that was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood
what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could
touch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany
velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and,
last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near
the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's
parties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once
more, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the
stairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION

"Stephen," said the Judge, in his abrupt way, "there isn't a great deal
doing.Let's go over to the Secesh property sales."The seizures and intended sale of
secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in
the city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as
unjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may
only be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any
goods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day
because it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember
it.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the
only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very
plainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at
that house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,
pretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,
in sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the
Judge leaning on his arm."Stephen," said he, presently, "I guess I'll do a little bidding."And, if he really wished to bid,
Stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him."You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose," said the Judge."Then," said the Judge, tartly, "by bidding, we help to support starving
Union families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.""I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple."He did not see the smile on the
Judge's face."Then you will bid in certain things for me," said Mr.Here
he hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench."Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I've got the
chance to buy it cheap."There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,
Stephen managed to say:-- "You'll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so
that a wagon nearly ran over his toes."I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to
say these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,
which was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of
Virginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had
actually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with
the piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they
came to Morgan's great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and
hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and
ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom
they spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might
see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's
household goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was
packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly
against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing
all in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way
fiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a
secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,
it was at the Judge's suggestion that a blue provost's guard was called
in later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before
the public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to
many a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the
children had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which
the little feet had worn in the corner.Those were the chairs the little
hands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the
armchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to
common gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and
here in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family
carriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the
happy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have
dropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the
family went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,
whose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one
day grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern
aristocrats.Catherwood, his face
haggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her
silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want
to see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been
taken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the
Judge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was
shouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the
stand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction."Now, gentlemen, and ladies," said the seller, "this here is a genuine
English Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the
celebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky."He lingered fondly over the
names, that the impression might have time to sink deep."This here
magnificent instrument's worth at the very least" (another pause)
"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated
in the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top
octave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard."Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were
who gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention
of committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which
penetrated to St.The owner was
a seedy man with a straw-, drunkard's mustache.He was leaning
against the body of Mrs.Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those
about him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was
followed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a
warning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came
out with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life
has been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed
himself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to
the floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he
stood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish
to do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and
there were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little
apartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have
said of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold
anything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for
the fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?"Give me a strong and consistent enemy," some great personage has said,
"rather than a lukewarm friend."Three score and five years the Judge
had lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more
that day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his
name with bitterness.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up
his cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out
a sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel's assessment.Many recall
to this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth
of itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in
admiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking
neither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the
day which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel
Carvel with the marshal's compliments, and put back into the cold parlor
where they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to
put down the carpet, but by Virginia's orders the rolls were stood up in
the corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no
sign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had
bought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the
narrow stairs into the Judge's office.Whipple's orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of
papers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally
set up.The Judge watched the
proceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,
yet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him
the key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of
man to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn
he had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,
as a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge
of tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once
they made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of
recruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely
a day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For
Stephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove
to make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the
Bellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the
girl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending
the destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The
Brinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving
camp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade's, when the day's duty was done, the young Union officers
used to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That
house, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this
history has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who
would never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such
young ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as
their interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,
and there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was
usually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade
himself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in
the afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface
of which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the
sky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed
fields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which
swayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne's cheeks.Before
they realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde
estate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the
<DW72> above the withered garden."The shutters are up," said Stephen.Colfax had
come out here not long a--"

"She came out for a day just before Christina," said Anne, smiling, "and
then she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of
the two women on the list of Sixty.""It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,"
said Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain
Sunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house
and sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was
the smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying
ice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, "how she loved to romp!What good
times we used to have here together!"But you could not make her show
it.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting
at the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not
let me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running
away.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?""The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black
cloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,
searching look."I think that we ought to go back."They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those
vivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their
substance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her
spirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her
face which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to
him alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,
even if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen
stood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright
gowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade's voice
mingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some
familiar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the
voice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen's hand in a warm
grasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The
military frock, which fitted the man's character rather than the man,
was carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an
expanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the
collar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache
was cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose
high, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost
straight, but combative."The boy doesn't remember me," said the gentleman, in quick tones,
smiling at Mr."Yes, sir, I do," Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star
on the shoulder strap, and said."Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen," Mr."Won't
you sit down, General?""No," said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and
mischief, Stephen thought."So you've heard of me since we met, sir?"Guess you heard I was crazy," said the General, in his downright
way."He's been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade," the
General went on rapidly."I'll make 'em eat their newspapers for saying
I was crazy.That's the Secretary of War's doings.Ever tell you what
Cameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,
when I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House.Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,
After lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He
asked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the
Potomac to Kansas.Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles
of front.Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we
are in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You
give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.''Two hundred
thousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands
in the air.says he, 'where are they to come from?''The
northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't
accept,' said I.Secretary, you'll need 'em all and
more before we get done with this Rebellion.'Well, sir, he was very
friendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed
out.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm
crazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered
to report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia
because he believes the lies."Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two
before, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in
front of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who
took his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could
believe them."They have to print something, General," he said."I'll give 'em something to print later on," answered the General,
grimly."Brinsmade, you fellows did have
a session with Fremont, didn't you?Anderson sent me over here last
September, and the first man I ran across at the Planters' House was
Appleton. ''To see Fremont,'
I said.'You don't think
Fremont'll see you, do you?''Well,' says Tom, 'go
'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian
prince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of
senators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you
may get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in
a hundred,' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his
chief-of-staff.'Next morning," the General continued in a staccato
which was often his habit, "had breakfast before daybreak and went
'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts."More
Californians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging
over the register.""Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General," said Mr."Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were
awarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn't his fault that the
inexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get
rich."To be sure
he was--didn't get along with Blair.These court-martials you're having
here now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we'll hear now how
those fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each
other on the stand is better than the theatre."Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set
this matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings
of the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules
was that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for
Virginia's piano against the Judge."Come, Stephen," said the General, abruptly, "run and snatch one of
those pretty girls from my officers."They deserve more, sir," answered Stephen.Whereupon the General laid
his hand impulsively on the young man's shoulder, divining what Stephen
did not say.said be; "you are doing the work in this war, not we.We
do the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you
gentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don't you
go to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have
in reserve.""You've had military
training of some sort?""He's a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir," said Mr.Brinsmade,
generously, "and the best drillmaster we've had in this city.He's seen
service, too, General."Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General
cried:-- "It's more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a
soldier.Let's see what kind of a strategist he'll make.Brinsmade, have
you got such a thing as a map?"Brinsmade had, and led the way back
into the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a
single vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was
giving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his
pocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.Then he drew a line from
Columbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry."Now, Stephen," said he, "there's the Rebel line.Show me the proper
place to break it."Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the
first, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River."Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that's
how I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there's a man named Grant down in
that part of the country.Ever heard of him,
Brinsmade?He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I
was.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May
morning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock."I saw him," he cried; "he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois
Road.But surely this can't be the same man who seized Paducah and was
in that affair at Belmont."They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after
the war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for
a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made 'em march halfway across the
state instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess
he is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke
loose when they got into the town.The Rebs
came back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,
you remember hearing about that."Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the
top of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on
the boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a
cigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,"
cried the General, excitedly, "what do you think he did?Hanged if he
didn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole
length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the
steamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so
astonished they didn't even shoot the man."And now, Stephen," he added, "just you run off and take hold
of the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent
you."It was little Tiefel, now a first
lieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few
days' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, and he had
a sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that
bloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he
should at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of
a dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup
together in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel
forgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man's
tales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel
cried out:

"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl."He is no more crazy than I am," said Stephen, warmly--

"Is he not?"answered Tiefel, "then I will show you a mistake.You
recall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,
and he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.Now up
gets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and
marches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says
he, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,
and this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says
he, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at
Sedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into
camp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops
may be handled.'""If that's insanity," cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the
little man; "then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows
how a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope's and
Steele's forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to
look into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it."And Stephen brought
down his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman's prophecy of the quiet
general who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole
country bummed with Grant's praises.Moving with great swiftness and
secrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore
Foote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman
had indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to
besiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with
him too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading
with sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy
and wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the
drays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way
along the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General
seized him unceremoniously by the shoulder."Good-by, Stephen," he said."Good-by, General," said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands."Ordered to Paducah," said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards
into an empty cabin."Brice," said he, earnestly, "I haven't forgotten
how you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are
useful here.I say, don't go in unless you have to.I don't mean force,
you understand.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or
write me a letter.That is," he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen's
white teeth with approbation, "if you're not afraid to serve under a
crazy man."It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of
Stephen's reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS

Summer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon
the city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat
with which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast
armies were drawing breath for greater ones to come."Jinny," said the Colonel one day, "as we don't seem to be much use in
town, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe."Virginia, threw her arms around her father's neck.For many months
she had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his
usefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and
his army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and
his aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine
morning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was
contemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city
without a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost
Marshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,
each waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal's clerks, and waiting
for that officer's signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,
and fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,
and readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not
to."Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?"Ballington trying not to look indignant
as he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's
desk, the one word: "Spot!"breaks the intense silence, which is one way
of saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged
that night at Government expense."Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?"asked the
Marshal, genially.The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow."I reckon I'll wait
till next week, Captain," said Mr."It's pretty hot to travel
just now."There were many in the office who
would have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable
than ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels
were to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was
a certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have
guardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed
this oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and
came away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but
Colonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had
never tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot
gasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,
under Virginia's care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern
prison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep
over the "Idylls of the King."But he was admiring, and grateful, and
wept when he went off to the boat with the provost's guard, destined
for a Northern prison.He had taken her away from
her aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her
occupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of
Price's rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The
favor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving
another sufferer the same comfort.One of
the mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel
Carvel's house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid
of the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper's visits to Locust Street had
continued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to
dwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the
platitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was
thankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father's sake, of course, that Virginia bore with
him.She tried to be just, and it
occurred to her that she had never before been just.Again and again she
repeated to herself that Eliphalet's devotion to the Colonel at this
low ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect
him.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee
and a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if
virtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take
advantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who
spent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper
had always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill
work.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion
was not left behind.Could it be that
there was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as
the kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The
worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself
now, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner
in Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject."I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," she said."Not that I like him
any better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he
would have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would
not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business
when the war is over."She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper."You are a good girl, Jinny," he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the
city, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia's horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order
was promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the
ten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate
the roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely
popular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship
made haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the
English Consul whose claims on her Majesty's protection were vague, to
say the least.For the first time,
when Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not
there."I don't blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees," she said."Then why doesn't he fight for the South he asked"

"Fight for the South!""I reckon not, too," said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk
with the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort
the papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone
by.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some
incident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his
hand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered
them all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he
was noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in
to ask Eliphalet's whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual
became importunate."You don't know nothin' about him, you say?""I 'low I kin 'lighten you a little.""Good day, sir," said the Colonel."I guess you'll like to hear what I've got to say."Carvel in his natural voice, "show this man out."Ford slunk out without Ephum's assistance.But he half turned at the
door, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia."Oh, Pa," she cried, in alarm, "what did he mean?""I couldn't tell you, Jinny," he answered.But she noticed that he was
very thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not
returned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for
him.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them
all tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they
had brought, which lay unfolded on her father's desk.It was signed
Stephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole
charge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel
war, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping
in the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her
cheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and
Ned and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom
of which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and
brought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her
father, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above
the Merimec, listening to the crickets' chirp, and watching the day fade
upon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to
smoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of
the porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe
and Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her
thoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon
she had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter
coming toward her."Honey, dey's comp'ny up to de house.He's
on de porch, talkin' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some
twenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered
down more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober
creation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was
unheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture
of annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,
swept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house."How-dy-do, Miss Virginia," he cried pleasantly."Your father had a
notion you might be here."Her greeting would have frozen a man
of ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet
showed.There was something in
the man's air to-day.Her words seemed to relieve some tension in him."Well, I did, first of all.You're considerable smart, Miss Jinny, but
I'll bet you can't tell me where I was, now.""I cal'lated it might interest you to know
how I dodged the Sovereign State of Missouri.General Halleck made an
order that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars.Then I was drafted into the Abe Lincoln Volunteers; I paid a
substitute.And so here I be, exercising life, and liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.""If your substitute gets
killed, I suppose you will have cause for congratulation."Eliphalet laughed, and pulled down his cuffs."That's his lookout,
I cal'late," said he.He glanced at the girl in a way that made her
vaguely uneasy.She turned from him, back toward the summer house.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure."I've heard considerable about the beauties of this place.Would you
mind showing me 'round a bit?"Not since that first evening in Locust Street had it taken on such
assurance, And yet she could not be impolite to a guest."Certainly not," she replied, but without looking up.He came to the summer house, glanced around it with apparent
satisfaction, and put his foot on the moss-grown step.She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and
stood facing him, framed in the climbing roses.He drew back,
staring in astonishment at the crimson in her face.She had been groping
wildly for excuses, and found none."Because," she said, "because I ask you not to."With dignity: "That
should be sufficient.""Well," replied Eliphalet, with an abortive laugh, "that's funny, now.Womenkind get queer notions, which I cal'late we've got to respect and
put up with all our lives--eh?"Her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her
whim.And she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at
home--it was nothing less.She strove still to hide her
resentment."There is a walk along the bluff," she said, coldly, "where the view is
just as good."But she purposely drew him into the right-hand path, which led, after
a little, back to the house.Despite her pace he pressed forward to her
side."Miss Jinny," said he, precipitately, "did I ever strike you as a
marrying man?"Virginia stopped, and put her handkerchief to her face, the impulse
strong upon her to laugh.Eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into
the common commercial Yankee.He was in love, and had come to ask her
advice."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she
answered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The
Sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across
from the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,
and the little eyes receded comically, like a pig's."Well, I've been thinking serious of late about getting married," he
continued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don't cal'late
to be a sentimental critter.I'm not much on high-sounding phrases, and
such things, but I'd give you my word I'd make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that
was the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis
without a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I'd be a rich man before
I left it.If I was to die now, I'd have kept that promise.I'm not
thirty-four, and I cal'late I've got as much money in a safe place as a
good many men you call rich.I'm not saying what I've got, mind you.I've stopped chewing--there was a time when I
done that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a
rebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead
against it.You wouldn't like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn't," she
said."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal
twang."Well, as I was saying, I've about got ready to settle down, and
I've had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her
bewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set
eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for
you to marry.'I'm plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work
right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I'm a plain business man with no frills.You're the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You'll need a man
with a fortune, and a big one; you're the sort to show it off.I've got
the foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I
tell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper
will be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,
his confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment
was still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,
as he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision
arose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She
thought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this
proposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet's
face, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who
rose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried
by--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes
over the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be
thought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had
lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would
buy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent
desire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for
many a day."You--won't--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with
the shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back
against a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over
the bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and
indiscretion entered his soul.You've got no notion of my
money, I say."If you owned the whole of
California, I would not marry you."He
slipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew
out some papers."I cal'late you ain't got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he
said; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You're poor, but I guess
you don't know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel's a man of honor,
ain't he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she
stayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain't much use in your lookin' over
them papers.I'll tell you what they say: they
say that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a
physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal'late you despise me, don't you?"he went on, as if that, too,
gave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel's a beggar but for me.All you've got to do is to say you'll be my
wife, and I tear these notes in two.(He
made the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company's an old firm,--a
respected firm.You wouldn't care to see it go out of the family, I
cal'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path
wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in
front of the house.His
pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent
forward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and
mine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar
posture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,
stroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they
sought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I'm
some use yet awhile.It isn't right that I should idle here, while
the South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a
Pennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel
had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay
flowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that
his heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,
and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the
glory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I
reckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I do
not come back, or occasion should arise, find Lige.Let him take you to
your Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert
House when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I
won't pry into your heart, honey.I
like the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father's hand and held
its fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned's
voice rose in the still evening air."Sposin' I was to go to N' Orleans an' take sick and die,
     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter's
bandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain't ramshacked de premises fo' you
bof.De co'n bread's gittin' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her
little leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had
found a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and
there she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his
hand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard
his firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST

We are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is
approaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no
Christmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.The brown river, excited by rains,
whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was
crisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless
spirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent
hold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled
by a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue
uniform.Rain nor heat nor
tempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was
left of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,
and the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers
and teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater
Mississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled
iron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had
never before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal
citizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the
city.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses
and slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid
down certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave
out his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of
speculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The
speculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the
bales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under
Pharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than
their descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours
materially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which
cost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came
to a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,
were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and
men,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and
thither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with
naval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river's bank watched the pillar of smoke
fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the
Commander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is
America."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers'
cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of
the torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted
two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in
the morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's
highway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose
a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have
delighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the
Mississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the
Parrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;
no snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon
and foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,
past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past
long-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of
a home.It spread out by brigade
and division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling
through the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts
began to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a
narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the
bank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their
heads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn
hands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with
shells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back
through the forests on that short winter's afternoon, dragging their
wounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in
the solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack
and repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which
tore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in
thick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his
lips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral's gunboat that night, but when
he returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of
officers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused
at a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning
jack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,
a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket
from Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army
core, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went
off to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a
self-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took
command.He smoked incessantly in his
cabin.He had look in his face that
boded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted
as nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to
Vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the
city, on the pasty mud behind the levee's bank were dumped Sherman's
regiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might
arrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of
the batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing
off stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the
branches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept
by inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of
Vicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the
batteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of
saws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news
of an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with
caps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and
the snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little
fighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the
detachment put off in the little 'Diligence' and 'Silver Wave'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and
cottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments
went by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General
Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with
their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the
Rebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon
waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently
the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black
Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a
second detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were
heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until
the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws
stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day
the General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in
a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered
among the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o'clock Saturday morning when
the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,
bedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a
young lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of
tobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the
Admiral--"

The General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper
which he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff
officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith
and all men here across creek to relief at once.I'll take canoe through
bayou to Hill's and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You're not going through that sewer in a
canoe without an escort!""I guess they won't look for a needle in that haystack," the General
answered."Get back to your
regiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that
followed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he
thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black
labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue
of the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman
himself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them
on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the
little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's
reply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the
boat holds together, General."The boughs hammered
at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell
like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a
half.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his
hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep
backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their
heads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found
a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the
day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing
further the stream below the fleet."The Admiral's in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet
the General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move
backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from
the cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on
the right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads
with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How
Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a
memorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny
horse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of
that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the
drops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on
the deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he
rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose
daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly
the only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,
did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass
in his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the
swamp?"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain
wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name
is Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at
Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat
from St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and
astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer
the way to General Sherman's headquarters.The officer, who was greatly
impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge
which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house
up to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn't Brinsmade.Come right in, come
right in and take dinner.I'll send
and tell Grant you're here.Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your
friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of
fever and bad food long ago.""I guess a
good many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I've come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses
are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly
the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the
two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The
General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in
the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their
faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond
them."That's poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They
tell me he can't live," and "That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish
some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep
well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no
peace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole
corps on duty to watch him."As long as
I live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed
inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our
churches.""I guess that's so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on
him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have
you ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may
remember talking to him one evening at my house."He
paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,
when Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,
for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone
and gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked
Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He
has spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go
to war.The first thing I hear of
him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his
cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter
to sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company
on the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I
shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he
swept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge
leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him
to report here at once.Brice's company were swinging axes when the
orderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his
boot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he
gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his
clothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room
where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,
smoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the
table.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced
on the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,
as always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was
tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small
wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in
Sherman.The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice,
somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man
says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly
over him as he added:

"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head
to heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,
and Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that
formal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be
rejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her
well, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which
your mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he
deplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,
but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his
little room.We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother,
to stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss
Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at
the mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored
for it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her
father's before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The
thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely
sweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I
should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite
me.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,
and--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very
curious expression, spoke up."That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to
Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the
package from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,
the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who
should come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a
cracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I
think you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted
it."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I've been
thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round
and talk it over with you first.That isn't strictly according to
the rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I
remember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways
What was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him
a lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting
me on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort
Henry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned
forward."And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come
into this war, let me know.'Then he said gravely, but with just a
suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you
wouldn't be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's
shoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn't."A STRANGE MEETING

The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure
turned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the
history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither
for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise
with equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work
gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And
by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and
suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports
swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the
sound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a
base--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the
country clear of forage.Confederate generals in
Mississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen
Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on
a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one
talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile
of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that
seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain
Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not
changed a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,
artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their
plaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where
the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by
the rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias
and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,
save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood
tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out
below.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous
repulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs
into the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army
settled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that
narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold
agonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring
back what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks
beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big
shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could
be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of
smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and
deepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of
blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along
the rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her
vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants
disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down
the trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the
ground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the
narrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps
were so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and
the other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,
sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white
side of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were
indulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses
rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who
replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens
of Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the
Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour
of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files
wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the
enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the
Jackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle
crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not
the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was
the stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were
dimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot
blast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of
shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as
arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty
thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the
crater's edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran
across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon
tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on
a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at
Vicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the
Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old
into the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she
had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think
or care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting
of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner
biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and
gone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war
does not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg
surrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See
the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds
of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the
blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms
are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when
the counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for
months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk.The
coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke
quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a
wistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man
as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday
of their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General
Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter
from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from
afar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its
face blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old
four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the
tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the
foot.So much for one of the navy's shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was
acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and
with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her
his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him
good by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money
from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that
he might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that
he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your
way.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long
mustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,
"you've brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we'd
been fo'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of
himself.He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his
attempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack
of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He
wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so
that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen's rank, "so we won't qua'l as to
who's host heah.One thing's suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I've been
heah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children
down in the Palmetto State.I can't offer you a dinner, seh.We've
eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to
interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.)"But I can offer
you something choicer than you have in the No'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel
remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army.My name is
Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have
the advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and
thereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like
straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit
seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor
justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with
still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which
his new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping
chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees
felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed
across from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your
damned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,
and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he
"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>
came down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company
was stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a
matter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our
sap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious
cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore
musket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive
bullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our
officers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One
fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He's the pride of
our Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope
man.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to
your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses
in De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the
face of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick
of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his
dinner in Vicksburg.He's pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the
Colonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain't a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you
might be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I'd
hate to see him die.The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get
care and good air and good food."He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce
grip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don't look
like the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his
former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,
where the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the
magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby
Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched
on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was
a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,
beside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which
seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture
of restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the
angles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has
slept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more
handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit
burned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he
dragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, "does he look as
bad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,
and bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was
pitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging
at his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"

"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was
passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor
from a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special
detestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the
memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia
had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now
that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was
unfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the
instrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the
sick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that
seemed to rouse him.And then, with
some vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,
"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you're too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North
to-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of
the room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He's sick--and God Almighty,
he's proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went
straight to Stephen's heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned
proud--But we ain't cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet
again--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we
may as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of
a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to
recognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this
glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of
them."Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not
change, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a
log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"

"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after
that.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran
these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their
gunners.""I'd like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he
was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He's
rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can
be sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as
long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to
send him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I'll bet he didn't
thank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods
are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They
never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like
the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how
they hate a Yankee!He's a cousin of that
fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a
pity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my
advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.""I'm glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when
Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to
do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how
he flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital
steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE

Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past
at Colonel Carvel's house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,
proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How
Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom
her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none
was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax's prattle about the
fashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I'm sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river
stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown.The girl, with her hand on the
wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,
across the Illinois prairie."I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news
travels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,
telling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of
silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness.Certainly, if
Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,
news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to
her house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has
lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee
yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old
man.""The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,"
replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She
thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying
patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence
of the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had
taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the
day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside.The
marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in
spite of all barriers.Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he
would speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light
would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia
to see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into
slumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge
from this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit
to herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen's letters to
the Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty
of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday
Virginia had read one of these to Mr.Well
that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was
not there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it
not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on
him, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit
at Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of
Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we'll make short work of the
Rebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as
she repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange
that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia
on the stairway.Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she
must have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But
Virginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her
heart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was
thankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old
Nancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have
more room and air.And Colonel Carvel's name had
never once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they
toiled against the river's current, while horror held her.Horror lest
her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by
the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was
not yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of
wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at
Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been
Colonel Carvel's!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that
was dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,
he was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia
sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning
quivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the
gravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell
on a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among
the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia's choice of
her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,
had drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia
herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke
of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best
friend were a Yankee--"

Judge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of
the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I
guess you don't understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last
of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of
letting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though
devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence
gave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;
or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of
the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the
roses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this
merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through
which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and
comforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the
brightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen
gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the
graceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers
everywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,
there was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all
laughter.He said it over to himself
many, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes
upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded
her face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,
as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she
did not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who
were gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling
for her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the
war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very
like it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not
give them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,
imploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love
him, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives
together, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence
Colfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power
of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to
heights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the
mistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly
miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had
she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain
times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison
Colfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission
to send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow
came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's
report that he was fit for duty once more.He
was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport
Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from
Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the
Confederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men
who made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and
the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and
yet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness
of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the
corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still
in its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and
Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his
white head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his
southward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to
take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were
standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around
the corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear
him.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so
dear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is
there, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob
de light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the
four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the
lawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found
his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier
who brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up
to see me."He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am.I
reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned
and <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage
was flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under
the spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his
cousin's face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed
intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the
bushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner
of the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage
stopped.Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card
figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court
House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway
which led to the Judge's rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,
flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's
arms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the
Yankees catch you--"

"They won't catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her
out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she
searched his own."I'm not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was
nearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a
man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and
heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist.He's the oldest friend
I've got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"

"Pa, you've been in battle?""And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a
while: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last
through the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up
everything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son
came home.She is a noble woman--"

"Her son?"Silas has done nothing
the last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before
he dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked
down at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around
the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,
"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see
if he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she
might have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing
beside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny.He was
a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,
pos' has'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the
stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps
Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open
the door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I
reckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am
afraid they are watching the place.""I don't think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after
dark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her
father's sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have
dragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long
he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an
eternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel
stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these
many years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give
you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no
other reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was
dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"

Mr.How many men do you think would risk their
lives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now
die happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I
thank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me
to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I
hope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were
dying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not
leave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in
this world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so
much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent.And
how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield
covered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father's arm as they
leaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of
the night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those
who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the
flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for
a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes.Of the old days,
of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her
father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how
sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose
and say:

"It's my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn
that he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon
this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard
that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She
wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only
one who had ever been known to break the Judge's will.Virginia's
eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,
smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers,
but not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and
softened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up
from the Judge's face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,
and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between
mother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought
of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence
from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from
the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk
in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line
of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf
on Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached
out and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a
high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other
side of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was
his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man
who lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North."A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome
that the servants were constantly complaining.""That seems similar to our case," said the lady, smiling, as she
interrupted the reading."One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into
the next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately
open.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,
laces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away
vigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be
found in the room."When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in
spreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry."He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to
him, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case
of the large kitchen clock."The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his
place of refuge when he was in disgrace."One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for
dinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon
managed to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam
fowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and
began plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the
servants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in
such a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Monkey was chained up, and soon died."Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,
"I wonder how old that monkey was.""The book does not mention his age, my dear."I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;
and then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'""If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,"
remarked the lady."His company does not begin to compensate for the
trouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and
tractable.""And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?""I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better
kind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny
tricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I
knew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I
should be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; "O, mamma, I wouldn't
have one of my pets killed for any thing."Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but
she wisely said nothing.I don't want to think about such awful
things."The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently
she said, "Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but
first I must explain to you what a sounding-board is."In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the
pulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was
thought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the
congregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my
grandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a
sounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would
fall on the minister's head and kill him."There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept
in his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,
which was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he
went out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out
of sight, on his way to church."But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under
his arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the
opportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,
ran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board."Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on
the congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle."The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much
enjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the
sounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was
unconscious of his presence."When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with
laughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it
his duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action
of his hands and arms."The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every
motion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the
countenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the
most solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity
appear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,
every word being enforced by great energy of action."All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with
ardor and exactness."The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man
and his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of
composure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one
of the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the
irreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the
merriment."Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal
standing on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his
might, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly
exasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey
removed, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to
recover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed."CHAPTER V.

JACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching
mice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to
good account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,
determined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,
and shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his
comfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every
thing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and
well secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this
treatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup
tureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over
the place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke
shivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup
tureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he
began to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on
the upper shelf."There is something good," he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,
raspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,
disappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in
a corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave
a scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a
thousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her
that this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,
who began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his
stomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his
excess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an
experiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new
mischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,
laughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as
he said, "We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;
but you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.""Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?""I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I
can find any for you."He opened the book, and then asked,--

"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in
their cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the
animal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there
till he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;
that is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,
and which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The
facility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the
branches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it
makes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,
it is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it
to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I'm sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile
tail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the
hay mow."But here is an
account of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black
hands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called
Hoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be
one of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to
death; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy
great quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by
the natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone
would compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us
that their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are
raised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in
which they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A
hand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum
in Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures
or hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other
substances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they
do not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general
cry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she
exclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a
difference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very
fond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount
them on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,
and if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most
beautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from
its extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at
liberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in
order to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a
wife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every
attention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much
cruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than
usual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,
after winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and
drew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave
her a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he
descended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great
indignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no
means always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one
more story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,
complied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this
chapter on Minnie's pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented
to his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress
used sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him
run up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,
ran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and
chattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,
'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally
leaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled
himself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth
open, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former
experience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at
cleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the
handle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he
relinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and
boots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering
all the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole
and all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &
Martin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was
a nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found
Sprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and
arranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he
heard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as
though nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was
given him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his
finger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the
other, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed
himself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped
out and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

73    "good morning," changed to 'good morning,'
112   pet monkey."Then she remembered
his middle name was Lyman, and said quickly, "I'll take it, please."She stepped into the carriage, and told the man to go find a directory
and look for Lewis Lyman Lockwood.The groom returned in a few minutes
and said there was such a name down in the book as a lawyer, and that
his office was such a number on Broadway; it must be near Liberty."Go
there," said Miss Catherwaight.Her determination was made so quickly that they had stopped in front of
a huge pile of offices, sandwiched in, one above the other, until they
towered mountains high, before she had quite settled in her mind what
she wanted to know, or had appreciated how strange her errand might
appear.Lockwood was out, one of the young men in the outer office
said, but the junior partner, Mr.Latimer, was in and would see her.She had only time to remember that the junior partner was a dancing
acquaintance of hers, before young Mr.Latimer stood before her smiling,
and with her card in his hand.Lockwood is out just at present, Miss Catherwaight," he said, "but
he will be back in a moment.Won't you come into the other room and
wait?I'm sure he won't be away over five minutes.She saw that he was surprised to see her, and a little ill at ease as
to just how to take her visit.He tried to make it appear that he
considered it the most natural thing in the world, but he overdid it,
and she saw that her presence was something quite out of the common.This did not tend to set her any more at her ease.She already regretted
the step she had taken.What if it should prove to be the same Lockwood,
she thought, and what would they think of her?Lockwood," she said, as she
followed him into the inner office."I fear I have come upon a very
foolish errand, and one that has nothing at all to do with the law.""Not a breach of promise suit, then?""Perhaps it is only an innocent subscription to a most worthy charity.I
was afraid at first," he went on lightly, "that it was legal redress you
wanted, and I was hoping that the way I led the Courdert's cotillion
had made you think I could conduct you through the mazes of the law as
well.""No," returned Miss Catherwaight, with a nervous laugh; "it has to do
with my unfortunate collection.This is what brought me here," she said,
holding out the silver medal."I came across it just now in the Bowery.The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr.Lockwood would
like to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what
had become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him."Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished
speaking, and was examining it carefully.He looked up with just a touch
of color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly."Please don't be offended," said the fair collector.You've heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think
I meant to add this to it.But, indeed, now that I have had time to
think--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was
so interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn't stop to
consider.That's the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over
other people's feelings, and runs away with one.I beg of you, if you do
know anything about the coin, just to keep it and don't tell me, and I
assure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself."Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal
in his hand."I hardly know what to say," he began slowly.You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop.Well, of
course, you know Mr.Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation."This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at
the time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the
silver and pawned it, I suppose.Lockwood would have given more for
it than any one else could have afforded to pay."He paused a moment,
and then continued more rapidly: "Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne.Lockwood and he were friends when they
were boys.They were Damon
and Pythias and that sort of thing.They roomed together at the State
college and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made
nothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with
Fuller & Mowbray.It was while they were at school that they had these
medals made.There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it.Well, they continued to live and work together.They were both orphans
and dependent on themselves.I suppose that was one of the strongest
bonds between them; and they knew no one in New York, and always spent
their spare time together.They were pretty poor, I fancy, from all
Mr.Lockwood has told me, but they were very ambitious.They were--I'm
telling you this, you understand, because it concerns you somewhat:
well, more or less.They were great sportsmen, and whenever they could
get away from the law office they would go off shooting.I think they
were fonder of each other than brothers even.Lockwood
tell of the days they lay in the rushes along the Chesapeake Bay waiting
for duck.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his
life.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or
snipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know
people; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great
deal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the
reigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with
that favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for
a while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially
favored.Lockwood never spoke of it
to me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought
the other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the
woman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion
of their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the
wrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that
is all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved
hand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly
ashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to
tread.Of course I might
have known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,
could I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn't if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid
her eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,
and rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,
and when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not
shown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned
from the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about
it a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given
up the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried
in her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another's story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to
know, she thought, as he and Mr.Then
she decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors
as it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a
recital of her afternoon's adventure, of which she had no doubt but he
would also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during
the dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she
allowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair
without disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me
about?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the
evening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a
card and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled
over his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a
nervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I'm quite sure it is
intended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some
keepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with
his name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn't go down, dear; I'll see him.It was I he asked for,
I'm sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it
must be for Mr.He did not like to disturb
his after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and
refolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;
"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood
once, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded
before he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were
engaged, and people did say that young Lockwood's chances at that time
were as good as mine.He was very attentive,
though; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which
she had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his
head uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I
speaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and
paused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not
altogether unblamable, in a woman's having two men quarrel about her,
neither of whom was the woman's husband.And yet this girl of whom
Latimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no
wrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way
with one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed
against her cheeks.It now seemed to her very
sad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city
and meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued
that her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would
have brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have
known, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that
had she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,
said something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her
mother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward
to greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of
the old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she
wished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer
had accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she
recognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in
the background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had
called to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand
as he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as
though caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had
the honor of being one of your mother's younger friends.That was before
she was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl
gravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old
enough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly
like your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was
very kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by
misunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and
I was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding
continued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to
himself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very
good of you.I don't know why I should keep it though, now, although I
was distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of
a time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend
who gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to
know each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a
lawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do
not know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down
at it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why
you and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it
was she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have
understood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble
she had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each
other.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a
coincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm
that her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don't
give it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am
sure he is still your friend at heart.Don't think I am speaking hastily
or that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if
friends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go
without a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a
very light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very
much, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I
brought back his pledge.""It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the
old man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still
holds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once
had for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I
thank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,
and--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,
as if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not
be shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden
determination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne's house at once,
to-night.I will see if this has
or has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should
be fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of
dishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be
your doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank
you for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God
bless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking
down at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office
had been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize
in the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the
cold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not
meet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I
have seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the
last ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and
Henry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take
a holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would
put the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days
afterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a
manner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place
in his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether
he succeeds or not?""You can
understand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I
would not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the
prettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached
the home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to
argue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking
before the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for
the first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard
Mr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he
waited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in
with his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,
something light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He
crossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing
the papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a
snap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little
while," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few
weeks' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS


It was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart
and a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was
cross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to
try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had
not appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into
a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin
swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he
pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to
be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in
having some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older
girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and
gazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk
leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,
so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained
where he was."I s'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school
voice, "there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see
from the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could
see all there is to see," said the third, "except what there's in the
middle where the island is.""I guess it's mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and
that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals
like that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and
unreservedly to listen."My, but I'd like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,
under her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up
anxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain't you having a good time
'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on
the swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,
they should not gratify it."Why, it costs more'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open
car," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but
blinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the
red seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to
the eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go
around in one of those things, and--and hasn't brought the change with
her, you know, I'm sure I should be very glad if she'd allow me to send
her around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply
and in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't
know," she said with dignity; "but if you're going anyway and want
company--"

"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself
riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from
the East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can't go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on
the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He
looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,
"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the
paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very
loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves
and crop.The three little girls
placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle
one, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent
ecstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it
careened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the
motion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would
see him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by
the bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to
play the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges
of the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling
their feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the
possibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,
although the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a
supposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he
ever enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a
record-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to
Van Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,
all the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that
ordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long
hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man
who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had
done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with
A Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How're you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around
the world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to
your young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late
guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,
and utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"
stammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these
young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at
him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber
grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the
swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now
you can take trips for a week without stopping.Don't try to smuggle in
any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that
he had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his
reward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls
proceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were
sunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of
a big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather
riding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR


There had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her
there, he accepted young Travers's suggestion to go over to Jersey City
and see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally
known as the Black Diamond.They covered up all signs of their evening
dress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for
the smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and
they also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was
acting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered
at their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the
platform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that
the "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their
patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even
whispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money
to back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in
itself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,
but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the
sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered
with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should
hold.It was two o'clock before "Dutchy" Mack's backer threw the sponge
into the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another
reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely
held the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as
Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get
anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation
and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus
McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room
of a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was
too late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs
tipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had
thrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk
facings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the
red glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the
reporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the
gentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they
were."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van
Bibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed
directly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may
think at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,
but it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like
this one would come across something that could not be explained away
something mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson's Suicide
Club.Dickens once told James Payn that the
most curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged
man who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the
owner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the
ground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the
sash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man's hand,
and he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come
across anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,
and at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in
imagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me
from barred windows nor 'white hands waved from a passing hansom.'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such
adventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,
and always ends in a police court or with a 'found drowned' in the North
River."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and
shivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the
side door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man
who tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling
her way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink
with them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were
in consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep
again immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and
pyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great
city is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,
sometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs
in a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and
characters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told
them that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh
air swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around
their throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the
cross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and
of the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off
to a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had
been asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the
man to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber
determined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays
up until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance
he had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and
the fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead
as so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out
of the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street
was quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van
Bibber's footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great
house at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was
walking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the
brown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door
in this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it
opened cautiously, and a man's head appeared in it for an instant and
was withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber
stopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the
street.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying
inside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to
frighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of
must belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured
himself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would
have liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in
adventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped
and caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of
the door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked
cautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the
only noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had
rested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to
open the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it
heavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down
directly on the other's head and shoulders.He could see the top of the
man's head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he
held a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of
different sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below
had robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for
his having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his
treasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a
fight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed
by the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the
two bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of
society, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top
of the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him
and shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his
movements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped
upon the man's head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk
with him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but
before the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,
Van Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his
hand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly
to where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up
I'll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous
inclination to add, "and I'll probably miss you," but subdued it.The
burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but
sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a
degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won't move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening
in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down
and ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven't got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You're a pretty
poor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won't go back--I won't go
back there alive.I've served my time forever in that hole.If I have to
go back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it.But
I won't serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to
prison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you
where I've been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the
life out of my legs.I couldn't hurt you if
I wanted to.I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am.And
now you're going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty
years, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my
time so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one
hand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps
of the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was
driving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn't
waste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn't.I knew this place and
I wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I'd have to
wait until I earned it, and I couldn't wait.I haven't seen my wife
for seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of
that--seven years.Seven years without
seeing your wife or your child!And they're straight people, they are,"
he added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took
another name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join 'em,
and I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he
added, dropping his face in his hands, "I've got to go back.And I had
meant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An' I don't care whether you believe
it or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn't say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with
grave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar
looked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest
suggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was
because of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved
Van Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I
suppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought
to give you up.""I'll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that's bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don't know
whether you're lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I
very much doubt it; but I'll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,
and I'll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station
and rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw
those bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the
milkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your
pockets, and don't try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful
look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he
was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept
just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to
what he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,
but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived
in the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of
relief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I
suppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town
for half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a
half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the
restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his
eyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave
him some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of
the station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and
clerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and
crossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter
laid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the
papers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance
on the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With
greater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the
"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias
"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had
been traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van
Bibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of
his whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are
confident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who
helped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to
get out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim
contentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don't know.Some bacon and eggs and
green things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN


Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer
about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found
the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that
has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the
country.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,
he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where
some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well
cooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about
them, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling
horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables
were unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in
a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed
the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late
breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most
remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a
young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young
man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth
moved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in
a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed
French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly
well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be
dining alone with so young a man."It wasn't my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I
know he would be out of town?Your
cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they're not my
cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much
different."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about
'em often; never seen 'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what
followed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,
and though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they
did not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not
unkindly."It doesn't seem to me that you are exactly rising to the
occasion.""Well, I don't know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of
town now.You go on and eat something, and I'll get a directory and look
up a lot of clergymen's addresses, and then we can make out a list and
drive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his
vacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at
five this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River
to-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They'll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that's all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you're the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away
with.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing
enough two days ago, and now you don't help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don't say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going
to make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a
best man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish
registry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been
at home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression
of his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her
handkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he
turned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van
Bibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston
family named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who
was Van Bibber's particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual
recognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had
dashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay
this chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish
came up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you
going?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;
then I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had
seen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and
that they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were
to depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said
they could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said
the elder brother, doubtfully."That's so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I
brought 'em here not more'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back
to the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to
Jersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon
as they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the
marriage, only too young, you know."Don't mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple
trembling on the terrace, "I've sent your brother off to Chicago.I
do not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a
honeymoon.But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it.Now,
if you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you
two babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of
whom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she
was very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying
circumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as
though they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least
forty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,
who would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or
a witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod
agent.Why you were not married
respectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but
a kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor
scandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names
into all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and
you will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just
rely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It's all going to
come out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially
good."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,
where he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have
the church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a
district-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn't matter
much whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,
but they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be
lunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first
went to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found
Mrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,
who had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the
Boston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to
secrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom
everybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly
invited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told
them that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then
he sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall
River boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van
Arnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got
into another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van
Bibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever
appeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge
yachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the
other fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but
the bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her
prospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of
the men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he
had ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and
the assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men
insisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the
absence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a
handful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at
the club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I
will send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will
read like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of
the season.And yet I can't help thinking--"

"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can't help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish's
older brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the
shade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he
added, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should
leave it alone."Green, Edward, The Moors, Welshpool.Griffin, F. W., Borough Fen, Peterborough.Welch, William, North Rauceby, Grantham, Lincs.Clark, A.

the prizes at the Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent, fixed the
type to find favour at other important shows.Very often the same
judges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the
same season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning
Shires.On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its
Council from as many counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection.For instance, Warwickshire--a great
county for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them--Mr.Potter--had recently come from Lockington
Grounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William.For many
years Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has
hailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number
of breeders of Shire horses.No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out.It is no light task, and nobody
but an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,
and Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,
whereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book
is 4200.The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their
old title of “War Horses.”




CHAPTER XIV

THE EXPORT TRADE


Among the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of
the Shire were the Americans.Very few London shows had been held
before they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take
across the Atlantic.Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse
Society granted 1264 export certificates.A society to safeguard the
interests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks
of Mr.A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in
his introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have
first-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour
to secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of
enhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England
and America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by
exercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to
pedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only
reap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to
this country.”

From the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June
3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of
Canada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the
merits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many
good Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was
118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United
States and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire
Classes.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done
is Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to
fifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be
extended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about
the stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore
they have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their
breeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to
extinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for
building up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred
re-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910
the number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if
the export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,
English breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British
Empire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial
prizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire
Horse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign
and Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES

The following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”
for 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--

    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is
    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal
    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,
    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,
    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in
    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire
    horses became known, and the more they came into competition
    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught
    purposes were appreciated.’

    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have
    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of
    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,
    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire
    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries
    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade
    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further
    development.The number of export certificates granted by the
    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal
    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire
    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,
    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,
    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and
    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a
    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,
    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,
    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more
    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present
    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings
    continue to be scarce and dear.”


THE NUMBER EXPORTED

“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year
or two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those
that go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is
worked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the
admiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,
except in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers
is to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than
on the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put
are also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very
high prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same
spirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal
could be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire
it is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is
unquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most
important horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the
breed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial
farmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a
similar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large
railway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a
binder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West
Territory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in
the stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are
keeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough
for their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only
kind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which
is certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the
native draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING

“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,
which is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire
horse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows
like Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at
the best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an
increase in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of
a thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;
but the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be
over, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have
declined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the
record average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general
average for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the
highest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being
1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre
Champion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and
Chancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,
1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases
of Mr.These figures show that the
worth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and
it is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is
by no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there
is ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in
view and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions
it behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American
word, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they
come to ‘the stud farm of the world.’

“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock
which has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly
emphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British
market being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of
males, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which
breeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood
famous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as
showing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after
year if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of
merit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply
of mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring
societies, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade
sires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,
and the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS

“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for
Shires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,
but from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either
forming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not
been responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable
that with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western
Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to
help the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be
useful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well
known, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an
average of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British
breeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest
fairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus
further the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the
export trade.”

It may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and
Lord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of
America for exhibition.CHAPTER XV

PROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS


Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge
cups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name
is mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show
of 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased
the second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.)He is
remembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short
legs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been
found at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan
and Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the
Filly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a
very high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,
which won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him
750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord
Rothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in
1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as
models of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in
1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win
highest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through
Lord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as
a two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,
so we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central
figure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Woldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the
Tring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire
Horse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased
Windley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the
Tandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the
Lockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir
Walpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King
blood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at
the Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a
brilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.
Ewart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at
Peterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt
deserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD

At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased
Dunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,
for 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won
second and third for him in London the same month, this being the first
show at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by
Messrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas
created quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so
for nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is
Mollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is
Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased
privately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines
is Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,
won first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards
selling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With
such animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,
although they do not come from the district known to the law makers of
old as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”


THE PENDLEY FEMALES

One of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at
the shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.J. G. Williams, Pendley
Manor, Tring.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under
notice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord
Egerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having
been first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest
Princess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup
winner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the
Tring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by
a female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest
King.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the
later acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and
reserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the
Royal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.Williams joined the
Shire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London
Championship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD

After Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that
the disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the
Edgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission
to the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,
1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and
half brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown
in London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry
in 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries
were made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize
yearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,
the own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold
Blue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize
yearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill
Forest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,
Ltd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.In future Edgcote
promises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its
Shorthorns.DUCAL STUDS

A very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace
the Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton
Nunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the
stud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke
of Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class
stud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker
Mars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the
Norwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912
for his popular owner.OTHER STUDS

Among those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old
English type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves
a foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of
stud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for
massive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree
which traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the
year 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire
weighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where
several sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave
860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he
sold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of
years, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by
Lord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen
to found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the
Shire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two
entries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which
reference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in
London, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall
Menestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild
as a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve
Champion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at
Shire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of
the Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion
honours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.A. Grandage, has
now been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,
his first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in
1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of
Lincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825
guineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,
seeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two
following years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are
likely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,
Highfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with
Rokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he
has taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and
has the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced
mare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second
highest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old
stallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London
ten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the
Winslow Shire Horse Society, and died.Another bad loss to Sir Arthur
and to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,
seeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest
King, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be
mentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,
first as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by
Redlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future
before the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame
achieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,
of Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore
Baronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for
the best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,
Danesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on
both occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of
admirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his
parade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but
Mr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove
otherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered
quite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of
high-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,
and a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge
(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.Salomons at the Tandridge
dispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of
1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury
Coronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his
class, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,
by the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both
being three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,
no matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who
has been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased
Danesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes
before re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes
Marathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and
fillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and
other meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,
Garstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,
King’s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won
first with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough
took first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and
mares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick
Champion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these
Lancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late
Mr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities
and keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged
in London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.This being a
record in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great
Show of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished
London winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom
(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the
Challenge Cup winning mare of 1907.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous
to mention in detail.Another very
impressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe’s
Premier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of
celebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a
great sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate
for thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw’s opinion
of him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton
sires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray
King, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when
sold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud
through several decades of last century, and that a large number have
been travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has
been done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the
influence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book
like this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that
they are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,
therefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz.Thomas
Ewart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud
of the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was
dispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of
which is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires
of Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at
Danesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking
over the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire
breeding quite successfully on his own account.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over
the Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let
the Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last
and worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate
means faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither
landowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be
mentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon
Menestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at
the 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,
who won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards
selling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree
with him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the
exhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable
horse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth
prize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter’s King’s Choice
above mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and
space permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his
best colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement
for the breed from a farmer’s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter
Gilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first
Shire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the
late Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by
Spark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby
sale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse
Society; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by
presenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering
1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)
at the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI

THE FUTURE OUTLOOK


This book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the
absorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is
the good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of
agriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a
certain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more
particularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three
seasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses
coming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together
with a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including
the weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no
provision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the
guns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and
most others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals
who have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered
mountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable
for mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or
drawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,
horse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,
particularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal
merchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry
users have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy
horses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they
have ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they
do, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the
necessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got
plenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,
“grow more wheat.”

If this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at
least to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,
that more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land
has to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home
and delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam
waggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or
standing idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare
does not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value
from the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years
old, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make
room for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and
most satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field
implements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of
the Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by
the Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--

“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live
stock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord
that Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the
rent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”

Most landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,
therefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have
done during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember
the Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth
seedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen.As long as there is
sowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.“Far back in the ages
      The plough with wreaths was crowned;
    The hands of kings and sages
      Entwined the chaplet round;
    Till men of spoil disdained the toil
      By which the world was nourished,
    And dews of blood enriched the soil
      Where green their laurels flourished:
    Now the world her fault repairs--
      The guilt that stains her story;
    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares
      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,
      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth
      Through endless generations,
    The art that calls her harvests forth
      And feeds the expectant nations.”

VINTON & COMPANY, LTD., 8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON, E.C.So also in charges of infantry, whether the battalion so
armed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley
of one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank
companies, must produce the most decisive effects.Neither can it be
doubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might
make the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their
rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur manœuvres.In
like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,
or for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such
occasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as
shewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark
that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited
than the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by
means of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both
carcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from
the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of
the third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or
three vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the
storming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest
stress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not
therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket
carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as
the 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the
10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a
Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell
thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_
throwing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the
_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question
that an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,
is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of
ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow
succession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,
and a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the
general basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due
proportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be
attained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to
exceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily
        produce more destruction than when they happen in
        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as
        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of
fortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is
the only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried
into a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets
may accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is
infinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would
enable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only
to scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or
passage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;
but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,
while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as
to the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets.The
frame is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of
the legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for
which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,
therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,
each of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it
with the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by
the haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the
frame being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into
the stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by
a trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men
are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail
set, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually
prevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to
the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;
it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself
discharged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a
six-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is
evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as
well as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or
tanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and
an attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as
from its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is
no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the
marine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the
burthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,
so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the
point of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:
insomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest
mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the
smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell
Rockets recochét in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is
another use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be
passed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a
ship by boarding.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short
stick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the
Rocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with
10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes
are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by
hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,
so as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual
destruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst
the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by
the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect
has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when
they enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER
SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;
by which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these
ships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending
entirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided
in the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and
shell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly
close together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and
top-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives
for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these
racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents
uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which
can be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged
merely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a
considerable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen
to the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will
have returned into safety before any discharge takes place.It is
evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be
calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the
fire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in
the most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to
have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it
is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with
clouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power
of destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass
harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats
in towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely
precluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any
boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth
shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had
an opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French
Fleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was
ascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it
in the enemy.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire
Rockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every
vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the
gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the
smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;
the sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either
by iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the
Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,
as shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and
frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of
war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all
positions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any
possibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these
ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for
bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,
are capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even
24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description
of small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for
general service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be
fitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described
in Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or
the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a
small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside
of the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small
vessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not
carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:
it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore
OWEN’s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and
some with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig.4]




ROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition
which have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion
Rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell
Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and
light natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number
of inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the
24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to
the 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are
from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,
or bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks
are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in
the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in
each case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole
of this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same
facility as the medium and light parts.These Rockets are fired from
bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;
or they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may
also be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the
purposes of explosion.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less
diameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are
therefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the
demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been
realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not
its only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses
than can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project
which, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,
mortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers
of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to
specify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally
used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of
bombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders
them in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them
as medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds
of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and
may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,
either for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations
of three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks
in the centre also strongly bound together.The great art of firing
these _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by
priming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of
powder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42
and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the
32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch
howitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the
least Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed
either with shot or shell, for field service.The 24-pounder Rocket is
very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the
saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly
equal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,
is armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a
6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder
with a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast
expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing
the resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description
of case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity
of musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the
Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained
in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be
given in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates
the balls.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained
in a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in
the shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,
are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be
instantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,
by a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the
bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the
Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden
fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can
be necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is
regulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving
any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden
fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By
this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a
facility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar
operations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient
length for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they
are made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose
issuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell
and case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the
mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,
according to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements
used for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of
different sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they
belong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to
accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into
the stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix
it immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not
hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the
different natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of
speculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter
found a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or
projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of
combining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively
a shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the
Rocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is
required at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be
carried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as
in Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by
a slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the
air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the
parachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended
in the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will
continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere
for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will
float in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived
and unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the
disengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is
not only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every
Rocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal
case, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage
from humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board
of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less
than eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to
render them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere
expense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,
case, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable
as ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1–15]

CONCLUSION.Calculations proving the comparative Economy of the Rocket Ammunition,
both as to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the
expense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true
understanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest
mode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the
field.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,
which has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with
the 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._

If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used
instead of manual labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be
reduced four-fifths, which would lower the amount to about 18_s._
each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted, which I am
endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of
the projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the
comparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of

So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an
actual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains
more composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing
any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and
that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together
with the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of
throwing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the
use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed £5; and indeed,
on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that
a transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with
every thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while
on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the
requisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need
specifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,
when compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch
spherical carcass costs £1.17_s._ 11½_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the
32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, does not cost more than £1.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case
there is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11½_d._ Now the large
Rocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the
difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the
different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least
double, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the
other comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15
to 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in
the first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate
economy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to
the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than £3.10_s._ that is to
say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,
though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration
are half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is
evident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets
may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling
mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch
shell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or
conflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the
first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a
comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the
Rocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0

                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How

    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,

                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED
  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:


  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.“How can I, Jenny,” she exclaims
piteously, “when dad’s out there?I don’t know whatever I would do
if anything was to happen to dad.”

“Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,” the Scotchwoman says
reverently.“Ye’ll be in richt gude keepin’ then, an’ them ye love as
weel.”

But Ruby only wriggles again.She does not want Jenny’s solemn talk.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little
daughter’s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so
tedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and
cups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child’s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been
gazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby
hardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members
suffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother’s
fretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away
her heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.“Oh, me!” sighs the poor little girl.“Will he never come?”

Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged
with the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to
meet him.“Oh, dad darling!” she cries.“I did think you were never coming.Oh,
dad, are you hurt?” her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a
sling.“Only a scratch, little girl,” he says.“Don’t
frighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened?Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?”

“I didn’t know,” Ruby says.“And mamma was
frightened too.And when even Dick didn’t come back.Oh, dad, wasn’t it
just dreadful--the fire, I mean?”

Black Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the
house, hanging on her father’s uninjured arm.The child’s heart has
grown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her
down for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous
self again.“Dad,” the little girl says later on.They are sitting out on the
verandah, enjoying the comparative cool of the evening.“What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house is burnt down?It won’t
hardly be worth while his building another, now that he’s so old.”

Dad does not answer just for a moment, and Ruby, glancing quickly
upwards, almost fancies that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave.Perhaps he does not even wish her to mention the
name of the old man, who, but that he is “so old,” should now have been
in prison.“Old Davis will never need another house now, Ruby,” Dad answers,
looking down into the eager little upturned face.God has taken him away, dear.”

“He’s dead?” Ruby questions with wide-open, horror-stricken eyes.The little girl hardly hears her father as he goes on to tell her how
the old man’s end came, suddenly and without warning, crushing him in
the ruins of his burning cottage, where the desolate creature died
as he had lived, uncared for and alone.Into Ruby’s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act left for ever undone,
a kind word for ever unspoken.“And I can never do it now!” the child sobs.“He’ll never even know I
wanted to be kind to him!”

“Kind to whom, little girl?” her father asks wonderingly.And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs out her story.“I can never
do it now!” that is the burden of her sorrow.The late Australian twilight gathers round them, and the stars twinkle
out one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars
and the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one
little girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be “kind,”
and it may be that in His own good time--and God’s time is always the
best--He will let old Davis “know” also.[Illustration]




CHAPTER VII.“There came a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season.Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,
  ‘A day for gods to stoop,’ she answered ‘Ay,
  And men to soar.’”

                                          TENNYSON.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase
away.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED

  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.Bryden, has observed
that the beasts and birds of the deserts must have private stores of
water of which we know nothing.Bryden, however, has seen the
Sand-Grouse of South America on their flight to drink at a desert pool."The watering process is gone through with perfect order and without
overcrowding"--a hint to young people who are hungry and thirsty at
their meals."From eight o'clock to close on ten this wonderful flight
continued; as birds drank and departed, others were constantly arriving
to take their places.I should judge that the average time spent by
each bird at and around the water was half an hour."To show the wonderful instinct which animals possess for discovering
water an anecdote is told by a writer in the _Spectator_, and the
article is republished in the _Living Age_ of February 5.The question
of a supply of good water for the Hague was under discussion in Holland
at the time of building the North Sea Canal.Some one insisted that
the Hares, Rabbits, and Partridges knew of a supply in the sand hills,
because they never came to the wet "polders" to drink.Then one of the local engineers suggested that
the sand hills should be carefully explored, and now a long reservoir
in the very center of those hills fills with water naturally and
supplies the entire town.All this goes to prove to our mind that if Seals do not apparently
drink, if Cormorants and Penguins, Giraffes, Snakes, and Reptiles seem
to care nothing for water, some of them do eat wet or moist food, while
the Giraffe, for one, enjoys the juices of the leaves of trees that
have their roots in the moisture.None of these animals are our common,
everyday pets.If they were, it would cost us nothing to put water
at their disposal, but that they never drink in their native haunts
"can not be proved until the deserts have been explored and the total
absence of water confirmed."--_Ex._




  [Illustration: From col.CHICAGO COLORTYPE CO.,
                 CHIC.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Just how many species of Gulls there are has not yet been determined,
but the habits and locations of about twenty-six species have been
described.The American Herring Gull is found throughout North America,
nesting from Maine northward, and westward throughout the interior on
the large inland waters, and occasionally on the Pacific; south in
the winter to Cuba and lower California.This Gull is a common bird
throughout its range, particularly coast-wise.Goss in his "Birds of Kansas," writes as follows of the Herring
Gull:

"In the month of June, 1880, I found the birds nesting in large
communities on the little island adjacent to Grand Manan; many were
nesting in spruce tree tops from twenty to forty feet from the ground.It was an odd sight to see them on their nests or perched upon a limb,
chattering and scolding as approached."In the trees I had no difficulty in finding full sets of their eggs,
as the egg collectors rarely take the trouble to climb, but on the
rocks I was unable to find an egg within reach, the 'eggers' going
daily over the rocks.I was told by several that they yearly robbed the
birds, taking, however, but nine eggs from a nest, as they found that
whenever they took a greater number, the birds so robbed would forsake
their nests, or, as they expressed it, cease to lay, and that in order
to prevent an over-collection they invariably drop near the nest a
little stone or pebble for every egg taken."They do not leave their nesting grounds
until able to fly, though, half-grown birds are sometimes seen on the
water that by fright or accident have fallen.The nests are composed
of grass and moss.Some of them are large and elaborately made, while
others are merely shallow depressions with a slight lining.Three eggs
are usually laid, which vary from bluish-white to a deep yellowish
brown, spotted and blotched with brown of different shades.In many
cases where the Herring Gull has suffered persecution, it has been
known to depart from its usual habit of nesting on the open seashore.It is a pleasure to watch a flock of Gulls riding buoyantly upon the
water.They do not dive, as many suppose, but only immerse the head
and neck.They are omnivorous and greedy eaters; "scavengers of the
beach, and in the harbors to be seen boldly alighting upon the masts
and flying about the vessels, picking up the refuse matter as soon as
it is cast overboard, and often following the steamers from thirty
to forty miles from the land, and sometimes much farther."They are
ever upon the alert, with a quick eye that notices every floating
object or disturbance of the water, and as they herald with screams
the appearance of the Herring or other small fishes that often swim in
schools at the surface of the water, they prove an unerring pilot to
the fishermen who hastily follow with their lines and nets, for they
know that beneath and following the valuable catch in sight are the
larger fishes that are so intent upon taking the little ones in out of
the wet as largely to forget their cunning, and thus make their capture
an easy one.Very large flocks of Gulls, at times appearing many hundreds, are
seen on Lake Michigan.We recently saw in the vicinity of Milwaukee
a flock of what we considered to be many thousands of these birds,
flying swiftly, mounting up, and falling, as if to catch themselves,
in wide circles, the sun causing their wings and sides to glisten like
burnished silver.It is claimed that two hundred millions of dollars that should go to
the farmer, the gardner, and the fruit grower in the United States are
lost every year by the ravages of insects--that is to say, one-tenth of
our agricultural product is actually destroyed by them.The Department
of Agriculture has made a thorough investigation of this subject, and
its conclusions are about as stated.The ravages of the Gypsy Moth in
three counties in Massachusetts for several years annually cost the
state $100,000."Now, as rain is the natural check to drought, so birds
are the natural check to insects, for what are pests to the farmer
are necessities of life to the bird.It is calculated that an average
insectivorous bird destroys 2,400 insects in a year; and when it is
remembered that there are over 100,000 kinds of insects in the United
States, the majority of which are injurious, and that in some cases
a single individual in a year may become the progenitor of several
billion descendants, it is seen how much good birds do ordinarily
by simple prevention."All of which has reference chiefly to the
indispensableness of preventing by every possible means the destruction
of the birds whose food largely consists of insects.But many of our so-called birds of prey, which have been thought to
be the enemies of the agriculturist and have hence been ruthlessly
destroyed, are equally beneficial.Fisher, an authority on the
subject, in referring to the injustice which has been done to many of
the best friends of the farm and garden, says:

"The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day to
destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are persecuted unceasingly.This
has especially been the case with the Hawk family, only three of the
common inland species being harmful.These are the Goshawk, Cooper's
Hawk, and the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of which is rare in the
United States, except in winter.Cooper's Hawk, or the Chicken Hawk,
is the most destructive, especially to Doves.The other Hawks are of
great value, one of which, the Marsh Hawk, being regarded as perhaps
more useful than any other.It can be easily distinguished by its
white rump and its habit of beating low over the meadows.Meadow Mice,
Rabbits, and Squirrels are its favorite food.The Red-tailed Hawk, or
Hen Hawk, is another."It does not deserve the name, for according to
Dr.Fisher, while fully sixty-six per cent of its food consists of
injurious mammals, not more than seven per cent consists of poultry,
and that it is probable that a large proportion of the poultry and game
captured by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is made up of old, diseased,
or otherwise disabled fowls, so preventing their interbreeding with the
sound stock and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.It eats Ground
Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose picture we present to our readers, is
as useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety per cent of its food is
composed of injurious mammals and insects.The Sparrow Hawk (See BIRDS, vol.107) is another useful member
of this family.In the warm months Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other
insects compose its food, and Mice during the rest of the year.Swainson's Hawk is said to be the great Grasshopper destroyer of the
west, and it is estimated that in a month three hundred of these birds
save sixty tons of produce that the Grasshopper would destroy.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.On account of the value of its skin, this interesting animal is much
sought after by those who take pride in their skill in securing it.It is commonly known by its abbreviated name of <DW53>, and as it is of
frequent occurrence throughout the United States, every country boy is
more or less acquainted with its habits.As an article of food there is
much diversity of opinion respecting its merits.It is hunted by some
for the sport alone, which is doubtless to be lamented, and by others
who enjoy also the pleasure of a palatable stew.As a pet it is also
much prized.The food of the Raccoon consists in the main of small animals and
insects.The succulent Oyster also is a favorite article of its diet.It bites off the hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the animal in
fragments with its paws.Like the Squirrel when eating a nut, the
Raccoon usually holds its food between its fore paws pressed together
and sits upon its hind quarters when it eats.Poultry is also enjoyed
by it, and it is said to be as destructive in the farm yard as the Fox,
as it only devours the heads of the fowl.When taken young the <DW53> is easily tamed, but often becomes blind soon
after its capture.This is believed to be produced by the sensitiveness
of its eyes, which are intended only to be used by night.As it is
frequently awakened by day it suffers so much from the glare of light
that its eyes gradually lose their vision.If it must be confined
at all it should be in a darkened place.In zoological gardens we
have frequently seen several of these animals exposed to the glaring
sunlight, the result of ignorance or cruelty, or both.Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at home in a tree, which is the usual
refuge when danger is near, and not being very swift of foot, it is
well that it possesses this climbing ability.According to Hallock,
the <DW53>s' abode is generally in a hollow tree, oak or chestnut, and
when the "juvenile farmer's son comes across a _Coon tree_, he is
not long in making known his discovery to friends and neighbors, who
forthwith assemble at the spot to secure it."The "sport" is in no
sense agreeable from a humane point of view, and we trust it will cease
to be regarded as such by those who indulge in it."The Raccoon makes a
heroic struggle and often puts many of his assailants _hors de combat_
for many a day, his jaws being strong and his claws sharp."The young ones are generally from four to eight, pretty little
creatures at first and about as large as half-grown Rats.They are very
playful, soon become docile and tame, but at the first chance will
wander off to the woods and not return.The <DW53> is a night animal and
never travels by day; sometimes it is said, being caught at morning far
from its tree and being unable to return thither, it will spend the
hours of daylight snugly coiled up among the thickest foliage of some
lofty tree-top.It is adroit in its attempts to baffle Dogs, and will
often enter a brook and travel for some distance in the water, thus
puzzling and delaying its pursuers.A good sized Raccoon will weigh from fifteen to twenty pounds.The curiosity of the Raccoon is one of its most interesting
characteristics.It will search every place of possible concealment for
food, examine critically any object of interest, will rifle a pocket,
stand upright and watch every motion of man or animal, and indeed show
a marked desire for all sorts of knowledge.Raccoons are apparently
happy in captivity when properly cared for by their keepers.Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.Whether in consequence of the effective working of the Wild Birds'
Charter or of other unknown causes, there can be no doubt in the
minds of observant lovers of our feathered friends that of late years
there has been a great and gratifying increase in their numbers in
and around London, especially so, of course, in the vicinity of the
beautiful open spaces which do such beneficent work silently in this
province of houses.But even in long, unlovely streets, far removed
from the rich greenery of the parks, the shabby parallelograms, by
courtesy styled gardens, are becoming more and more frequently visited
by such pretty shy songsters as Linnets, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Finches, who, though all too often falling victims to the predatory
Cat, find abundant food in these cramped enclosures.Naturally some
suburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,
which, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless
grip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may
occasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Even
the towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of
Westminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering
chimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be
found in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the
irrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in
considerable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident
on the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn
Square, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair
or more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and
whose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their
surroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the
part of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their
nests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,
persist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or
terrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._




  [Illustration: From col.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,
in that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being
no larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.The Pigmy is an
inhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar
to those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity
is implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to
reconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,
and its investigations are pursued until "the dire answer to all
inquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank."The Pigmy
Antelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may
be considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate
workmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and
their place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They
came from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,
increased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro
from the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the
Cassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds
alighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,
daylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured
during the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was
after birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being
fairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels
of the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,
while the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the
flat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with
many turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were
invariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,
both sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above
the surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand
into their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its
vise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.The rookeries of the
Murres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the
sea.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered
along the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only
by means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._




THE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Blue Jay
imitated, as you will remember, in the story "The New Tenants,"
published in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve
either of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what
a lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop
down into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off
a Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than
Chickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird
once in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am
hungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the
barnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve
the name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber
are the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old
crow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in
a soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When
we build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady
Red-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old
lady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on
he rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go
to his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid
of them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to
rout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him
to the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently
follows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little
assailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,
as well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to
know it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits
the woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,
Moles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or
Bob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the
timber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its
natural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might
destroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from
the perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long
time without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this
species from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine
days after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and
he allowed them to hatch and rear their young.One winter during his
absence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found
them building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time
in a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that
they become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which
they vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within
their limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being
especially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of
Winter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though
it does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or
four--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown.According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the
variation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this
must be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species
vary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of
the wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,
while thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,
that, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous
curiosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its
Doves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to
every lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that
they fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless
numbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found
on the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but
as a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,
however, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage
is of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally
one of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a
handful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand
or shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed
a pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of
San Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one
intentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will
crowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until
you can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread
for their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who
must certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger
makes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,
and in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are
found perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally
we will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never
appear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell
tower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite
roosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and
the extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:

Centuries ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,
and army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic
and cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as
a port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as
a consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather
indifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by
one and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they
stood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during
one of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city
had been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming
to such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of
lack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow
the city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups
on the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,
when lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon
the city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned
supreme, and men asked each other: "What new calamity is this?"As the
cloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,
which, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, "The Doves!It
appears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times
for Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,
there would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace
and happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of
attacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet
also stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity
would reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves
would leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it
was told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,
but they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of
Venice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San
Marco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous
Doges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the
palace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What
a boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the
doomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now
deserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that
they may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._




BUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,
creeping caterpillars" should be almost as numerous in October as in
the balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some
parts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year
for the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not
quite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect
condition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and
remain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these
delicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of
the mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current
Literature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,
and they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines
as the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the
ground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders
their identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and
September.All June and July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal
foliage.The "little wood brownies," or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over
the shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers
in the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several
other small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily
distinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are
tailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some
of the varieties with specks of white or blue."Their presence in the gardens and meadows," says a recent writer,
"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element
of gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding
wayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among
them might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his
path.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,
and they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to
investigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings
high into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can
only claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers
into all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with
torn and faded wings."[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they
would call me that than stupid, however."Look pleasant," said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,
and I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy
head, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering
so sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave
of sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat
brow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like
a robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You
couldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the
dead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for
a Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest
stream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout
in the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing
by his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the
water and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes
to be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap
go my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,
the ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up
their long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the
hillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,
and other Birds.For dessert I have
only to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and
grapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat
and saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of
traps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more
southern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state
of Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,
according to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in
this country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does
that proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and
the smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and
differs from him in being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary and black."He
also differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect
one, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the
Fox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels
very much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,
however, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the
scent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil
of a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or
five cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers
they assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very
likely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by

abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol.It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.On his right hand was a representation
of heaven, and on the left, of hell.Heaven was made to appear like a
bright, beautiful, and glorious place.A wall of pink color surrounded
it, and in the center was a spring of clear water.In the midst of this
spring stood a tree, bearing on every limb a lighted candle, and on the
top, the image of Christ and a dove.Hell was surrounded by a black wall, within which, there was also a
spring; but the water was very black, and beside it stood a large black
image, with horns on its head, a long tail, and a large cloven foot.The
place where it stood was in deep shadow, made to resemble, as neatly
as possible, clouds and darkness.The priest led me up to this fearful
object, and placed me on one side of it, while he stood on the other;
but it would turn away from him towards me, roll up its great eyes, open
its mouth and show its long white tusks.The priest said it turned from
him, because he was a good man, and I was very wicked.He said that it
was the devil, come up from the bottomless pit to devour me; and if I
said such wicked words again, it would carry me off.I was very much
frightened, for I then thought that all he said was true; that those
images, which I now know were strung on wires were really what they were
made to represent.In fact, until I was fifteen years old, I really believed that the image
I then saw was an evil spirit.But since that time, I have been made
to know that the priests themselves are the only evil spirits about the
place.Priest Dow then led me back to the nursery, and left me with the
Superior.But he soon came, back, saying he "knew what I was thinking
about; that I had wicked thoughts about him; thought he was a bad man,
and that I wished to leave him and go to my father;" Now this was all
true, and the fact that he knew it, frightened me accordingly.It was a
sure proof that what Father Darity said was true.But how could I ever
be safe, if they could thus read the inmost secrets of my soul?I did
dislike them all very much indeed and I could not help it.How then
could I avert the consequences of this deep aversion to convent life,
since it could not be concealed?Was it possible for me so far to
conquer myself, as to love the persons with whom I lived?How many
nights did I lie awake pondering this question, and resolving to make
the effort.I was, of course, too young to know that it was only by
shrewd guessing, and a general knowledge of human nature, that he was
enabled to tell my thoughts so correctly."Now," said he, "for indulging these dreadful thoughts, I shall take you
back to the devil, and give you up to him."I was frightened before; but
I have no words to describe my feelings when he again led me back, and
left me beside the image, saying, as he closed the door, "If the devil
groans three times, and the Lord does not speak, you must stay here
until to-morrow at this time."I trembled so that I could hardly stand,
and when, after a few moments, a sound like a groan fell upon my ears, I
shrieked in the extremity of terror.[Footnote: Cioui, formerly a Benedictine Monk, giving an account of his
imprisonment at Rome, after his conversion says:--

"One evening, after listening to a discourse filled with dark images of
death, I returned to my room, and found the light set upon the ground.I took it up and approached the table to place it there, but what was
my horror and consternation at beholding spread out upon it, a whitened
skeleton!Before the reader can comprehend my dismay, it is necessary
he should reflect for a moment on the peculiarities of childhood,
especially in a Romish country, where children are seldom spoken to
except in superstitious language, whether by their parents or teachers:
and domestics adopt the same style to answer their own purposes,
menacing their disobedient charges with hobgoblins, phantoms and
witches.Such images as these make a profound impression on tender
minds, leaving a panic terror which the reasoning of after years is
often unable entirely to efface.There can be no doubt but that this
pernicious habit, is the fruit of the noxious plant fostered in the
Vatican.Rising generations must be brought up in superstitious terror,
in order to render them susceptible to every kind of absurdity; for this
terror is the powerful spring, employed by the priests and friars, to
move at their pleasure families, cities, provinces, nations.Although
in families of the higher order, this method of alarming infancy is much
discountenanced, nevertheless, it is impossible but that it should in
some degree prevail in the nursery.Nor was it probable that I should
escape this infections malady, having passed my whole days in an
atmosphere, charged more than any other with that impure miasma
priest-craft."]Then immediately I heard the question, and it seemed to come from the
figure of Christ, "Will you obey?I answered in
the affirmative as well as I could, for the convulsive sobs that shook
my frame almost stopped my utterance.I now know that when the priest
left me, he placed himself, or an assistant, behind a curtain close to
the images, and it was his voice that I heard.But I was then too young
to detect their treacherous practices and deceitful ways.On being taken back to the Superior, I was immediately attacked with
severe illness, and had fits all night.It seemed to me that I could
see that image of the devil everywhere.If I closed my eyes, I thought
I could feel him on my bed, pressing on my breast, and he was so heavy I
could scarcely breathe.I was very sick, and suffered much bodily pain,
but the tortures of an excited imagination were greater by far, and
harder to bear than any physical suffering.For long years after, that
image haunted my dreams, and even now I often, in sleep, live over again
the terrors of that fearful scene.I was sick a long time; how long I do
not know; but I became so weak I could not raise myself in bed, and they
had an apparatus affixed to the wall to raise me with.For several days
I took no nourishment, except a teaspoonful of brandy and water which
was given me as often as I could take it I continued to have fits every
day for more than two years, nor did I ever entirely recover from the
effects of that fright.Even now, though years have passed away, a
little excitement or a sudden shock, will sometimes throw me into one of
those fits.During this illness I was placed under the care of an Abbess whom they
called St.There were many other Abbesses in the convent, but
she was the principal one, and had the care of all the clothing.If
the others wished for clean clothes, they were obliged to go to her for
them.In that way I saw them all, but did not learn their names.They
approached me and looked at me, but seldom spoke.This I thought very
strange, but I now know they dared not speak.One day an Abbess came to
my bed, and after standing a few moments with the tears silently flowing
down her cheeks, asked me if I had a mother.I told her I had not, and I
began to weep most bitterly.I was very weak, and the question recalled
to my mind the time when I shared a father's love, and enjoyed my
liberty.Then, I could go and come as I chose, but now, a slave for
life, I could have no will of my own, I must go at bidding, and come at
command.This, I am well aware, may seem to some extravagant language;
but I use the right word.I was, literally, a slave; and of all kinds of
slavery, that which exists in a convent is the worst.I say, THE WORST,
because the story of wrong and outrage which occasionally finds its way
to the public ear, is not generally believed.You pity the poor black
man who bends beneath the scourge of southern bondage, for the tale
comes to you from those who have seen his tears and heard his groans.But you have no tears, no prayers, no efforts for the poor helpless
nun who toils and dies beneath the heartless cruelty of an equally
oppressive task-master.No; for her you have no sympathy, for you do not
believe her word.Within those precincts of cruelty, no visitor is ever
admitted.No curious eye may witness the secrets of their prison-house.Consequently, there is no one to bear direct testimony to the truth of
her statements.Even now, methinks, I see your haughty brow contract,
and your lip curl with scorn, as with supreme contempt you throw down
these pages and exclaim, "'Tis all a fiction.O, that the strong arm
of the law would interpose in our behalf!--that some American Napoleon
would come forth, and break open those prison doors, and drag forth to
the light of day those hidden instruments of torture!There would then
be proof enough to satisfy the most incredulous, that, so far from being
exaggerated, the half has not been told.Will you not
arise in your might, and demand that these convent doors be opened, and
"the oppressed" allowed to "go free"?Or if this be denied, sweep from
the fair earth, the black-hearted wretches who dare, in the very face
of heaven, to commit such fearful outrages upon helpless, suffering
humanity?How long--O how long will you suffer these dens of iniquity
to remain unopened?How long permit this system of priestly cruelty to
continue?Would that I might forever wander
from it--that I might at once blot from memory's page, the fearful
recollection that must follow me to my grave!Yet, painful as it is
to rehearse the past, if I can but awaken your sympathy for other
sufferers, if I can but excite you to efforts for their deliverance, it
is all I ask.The Abbess saw how deeply I was grieved, and immediately left the room.Bridget told me not to cry, for she would be a mother to me as long
as I remained with her, and she was true to her promise.Another sister,
who sometimes came to my room, I believe was crazy.She would run up to
my bed, put her hand on me, and burst into a loud and hearty laugh.This
she repeated as often as she came, and I told the Abbess one day, I did
wish that sister would not come to see me, for she acted so strange, I
was afraid of her.She replied, "do not care for her; she always does
just so, but we do not mind her; you must be careful what you say," she
continued, "for if you speak of her before any of the sisters, they may
get you into trouble."When I began to get better, I had a sharp appetite for food, and was
hungry a great part of the time.One of the sisters used to bring me a
piece of bread concealed under her cape and hide it under my pillow.How she obtained it, I do not know, unless she saved it from her own
allowance.It was very easy for her to hide it in this way, for the nuns
always walk with one hand under their cape and the other by the side.Truly, in this instance, "bread eaten in secret" was "pleasant."Of
all the luxuries I ever tasted, those stolen bits of bread were the
sweetest.During my illness I thought a great deal about my father, and wondered
why he did not come to see me, as he had promised.I used to cry for him
in my sleep, and very often awoke in tears.Bridget sought in every
possible way to make me forget him, and the priest would tell me that I
need not think so much about him, for he no longer cared for me.He
said the devil had got him, and I would never see him again.These cruel
words, so far from making me forget, served to awaken a still greater
desire to see him, and increased my grief because I was denied the
privilege.In the room with me, were six other little girls, who were all sick at
the same time, and St.Bridget took care of us all For two of the little
girls, I felt the greatest sympathy.They were quite young, I think not
more than three years of age, and they grieved continually.They made
no complaint, did not even shed a tear, but they sobbed all the time,
whether asleep or awake.Of their history, I could learn nothing at that
time, except the fact, that they were taken from their parents for the
good of their souls.I afterwards overheard a conversation that led me
to think that they were heirs to a large property, which, if they were
out of the way, would go to the church.But it is of what I know, and
not what I think, that I have undertaken to write, and I do know that
the fate of those little girls was hard in the extreme, whatever might
have been the cause of their being there.Torn from parents and friends while yet
in early childhood--doomed while life is spared, to be subject to the
will of those who know no mercy--who feel no pity, but consider it a
religious duty to crush, and destroy all the pure affections--all the
exquisite sensibilities of the human soul.Yet to them these hapless
babes must look for all the earthly happiness they could hope to enjoy.They were taught to obey them in all things, and consider them their
only friends and protectors.I never saw them after I left that room,
but they did not live long.I was glad they did not, for in the cold
grave their sufferings would be over and they would rest in peace.O, how little do Protestants know the sufferings of a nun!and truly
no one can know them except by personal experience.One may imagine the
most aggravated form of cruelty, the most heart-rending agonies, yet I
do believe the conception of the most active imagination would fall
far short of the horrible reality.I do not believe there was one happy
individual in that convent, or that any one there, if I except the lady
Superior, knew anything of enjoyment.Life with them was a continual
round of ceaseless toil and bitter self-denial; while each one had some
secret grief slowly but surely gnawing away the heart-strings.I have
sometimes seen the Abbess sitting by the bedside of the sick, with her
eyes closed, while the big tears fell unchecked over her pale cheeks.When I asked her why she wept, she would shake her head, but never
speak.I now know that she dare not speak for fear of punishment.The abbesses in the various parts of this convent are punished as much
as the nuns, if they dare to disobey the rules of the priests; and if
the least of these are broken in the presence of any one in the house,
they will surely tell of it at confession.In fact, they are required
to do this; and if it is known that one has seen a rule broken, or a
command disobeyed, without reporting it, a severe punishment is sure to
follow.Thus every individual is a spy upon the rest; and while every
failure is visited with condign punishment, the one who makes the most
reports is so warmly approved, that poor human nature can hardly resist
the temptation to play the traitor.Friendship cannot exist within
the walls of a convent, for no one can be trusted, even with the most
trifling secret.Whoever ventures to try it is sure to be betrayed.While I was sick Father Darity came often to see me, and by his kindness
succeeded in gaining my affections.I was a great favorite with him;
he always called me his little girl, and tried in every way to make me
contented.He wished to make me say that I was happy there, that I
liked to live with them as well as with my father.But I could never be
persuaded to say this, for it was not the truth, and I would not tell a
falsehood unless forced to do so.He said I must be a good girl, and he
hoped I would sometime see better times, but I could never see my father
again, and I must not desire it.He advised me, however hard it might
be, to try and love all who came into the nunnery, even those who were
unkind, who wished to injure me or wound my feelings.He told me how
Jesus Christ loved his enemies; how he died for them a cruel death on
the cross; how, amid his bitter agonies, he prayed for them, and with
his expiring breath he cried, "Father, forgive them, they know not what
they do.""And now," said he, "can you do as Jesus Christ did?He has
set you an example, can you not follow it?""No, sir," I replied, "I
cannot love those who punish me so cruelly, so unjustly.I cannot love
the little girl who reported what I said in the yard, when she said as
bad things as I did.""But you forget," said he, "that in doing this she
only obeyed the rules of the house.She only did her duty; if you
had done yours, you would have reported her.""I'll never do that," I
exclaimed, emboldened by his kindness."It is a bad rule, and--" "Hush,
hush, child!""Do you know to whom you are
speaking?and do you forget that you are a little girl?I must give you a penance for those naughty words,
and you will pray for a better spirit."He said much more to me, and
gave me good advice that I remember much better than I followed.He
enjoined if upon me to keep up good courage, as I would gain my health
faster.He then bade me farewell, telling me not to forget, to repeat
certain prayers as a penance for my sin in speaking so boldly.O, did
he think when he talked to me so kindly, so faithfully, that it was his
last opportunity to give me good advice?Did he know that he left me to
return no more?I saw nothing unusual in his appearance, and I did not
suspect that it was the last time I should see his pleasant face and
listen to his kindly voice.I loved that man, and bitter were the tears
I shed when I learned that I should never see him again.The Abbess
informed me that he was sent away for something he had done, she did not
know what.He had a
kind heart; he could feel for the unfortunate, and that, with the Roman
Catholics, is an "unpardonable sin."CHAPTER V.

CEREMONY OF CONFIRMATION.I continued to regain my health slowly, and the Abbess said they would
soon send me back to the nursery.I could not endure the thought of
this, for I had the greatest fear of the Abbess who had the charge of
that department.Bridget was as kind
as she dare to be.She knew full well that if she allowed herself to
exhibit the least feeling of affection for those children, she would be
instantly removed, and some one placed over them who would not give way
to such weakness.We all saw how it was, and loved her all the more
for the severity of her reproofs when any one was near.With tears,
therefore, I begged to be allowed to stay with her; and when the priest
came for me, she told him that she thought I had better remain with her
till I gained a little more strength.To this he consented, and I was very grateful indeed for the kindness.Wishing in some way to express my gratitude, as soon as I was able I
assisted in taking care of the other little girls as much as possible.Bridget, in turn, taught me to read a little, so that I could learn
my prayers when away from her.She also gave me a few easy lessons in
arithmetic, and instructed me to speak the Celt language.She always
spoke in that, or the French, which I could speak before, having learned
it from the family where I lived after my father gave up his saloon.They were French Catholics and spoke no other language.As soon as I was sufficiently recovered to leave my room, I was taken to
the chapel to be confirmed.Before they came for me, the abbess told me
what questions would be asked, and the answers I should be required
to give.She said they would ask me if I wished to see my father; if I
should like to go back to the world, etc.To these and similar questions
she said I must give a negative answer."But," said I, "that will be a
falsehood, and I will not say so for any of them."From my
heart I pity you; but it will be better for you to answer as I tell
you, for if you refuse they will punish you till you do.Remember," she
added, emphatically, "remember what I say: it will be better for you
to do as I tell you.""But why do
they wish me to tell a lie?""They do not wish you to tell a
lie," she replied; "they wish you to do right, and feel right; to be
contented and willing to forget the world.""But I do not wish to forget
the world," I said."I am not contented, and saying that I am will not
make me feel so."It is right for you to
obey," she replied, with more severity in her tone than I ever heard
before."Do you know," she continued, "that it is a great sin for you
to talk so?"I exclaimed, in astonishment; "why is it a sin?""Because," she replied, "you have no right to inquire why a command
is given.Whatever the church commands, we must obey, and that, too,
without question or complaint.If we are not willing to do this, it
is the duty of the Bishop and the priests to punish us until we are
willing.All who enter a convent renounce forever their own will.""But
I didn't come here myself," said I; "my father put me here to stay a few
years.When I am eighteen I shall go out again.""That does not make any
difference," she replied."You are here, and your duty is obedience.But my dear," she continued, "I advise you never again to speak of going
out, for it can never be.By indulging such hopes you are preparing
yourself for a great disappointment.By speaking of it, you will,
I assure you, get yourself into trouble.You may not find others
so indulgent as I am; therefore, for your own sake, I hope you
will relinquish all idea of ever leaving the convent, and try to be
contented."Such was the kind of instruction I received at the White
Nunnery.I did not feel as much disappointed at the information that I
was never to go into the world again as she had expected.I had felt for
a long time, almost, indeed, from my first entrance, that such would be
my fate, and though deeply grieved, I was able to control my feelings.The great day at length came for which the Abbess had been so long
preparing me.I say great, for in our monotonous life, the smallest
circumstance seemed important.Moreover, I was assured that my future
happiness depended very much upon the answers, I that day gave to the
various questions put to me.When about to be taken to the chapel, St.Bridget begged the priest to be careful and not frighten me, lest it
should bring on my fits again.I was led into the chapel and made to
kneel before the altar.The bishop and five priests were present, and
also, a man whom I had never seen before, but I was told he was the
Pope's Nuncio, and that he came a long way to visit them.I think this
was true, for they all seemed to regard him as a superior.I shall never
forget my feelings when he asked me the following questions, which I
answered as I had been directed."How
many persons are there in God?""Three; the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.""Do you
wish to go back and live with your father?""Do you think you
can live all your life with us."He then said,
"You will not fare any better than you have hitherto, and perhaps not
as well."It was with the greatest difficulty that I could control my
feelings sufficiently to answer this last question.But remembering
what the Abbess had told me, I suppressed my tears, and choked down
the rising sob.Surely those men must have known that I was telling a
falsehood--that the profession I made was not in accordance with my real
sentiments.For myself, I then felt, and still feel that the guilt was
not mine.The Bishop was then told to hear my confession, after which, a priest
took some ointment from a small box, and rubbed it on my forehead, and
another priest came with a towel and wiped it off.Bridget, with whom I remained, as long as I was in the White
Nunnery.On my tenth birthday, the Bishop came to the Abbess very early in the
morning, and informed her that I was to take the White Veil that day,
and immediately after the ceremony, I would leave for the Grey Nunnery
in Montreal.He desired her to make all the necessary preparation, and
take her leave of me, as she would not see me again.This was sad news
for us both, for I felt that she was my only friend, and I knew that she
felt for me, the most sincere affection.She gave me much good advice in
reference to my future conduct, and with tears exhorted me to be kind,
cheerful, and obedient.I was going to a new place, she said, and if I
was a good girl, and sought to please my superiors, I would find some
one to be kind to me.She advised me to try and appear contented
in whatever situation I might be placed, and above all other
considerations, never disobey the least command."Obedience," she again
repeated, "is the rule in all convents, and it will be better for you to
obey at once, and cheerfully, and willingly comply with every request,
than to incur displeasure and perhaps punishment, by any appearance of
reluctance or hesitation.If there is any one thing that you dislike to
do, be sure that you do not betray your feelings, for if you do, that
will be the very thing they will require of you; and I assure you, if
you once become the object of suspicion or dislike, your condition will
be anything but agreeable.You will be marked and watched, and required
to do many unpleasant things, to say the least.Therefore I hope you
will perform all your duties with a cheerful and willing spirit."Bitterly did I grieve at the thought of being separated from the only
being on earth who seemed to care for me.In the anguish of the moment,
I wished I might die.Bridget reproved me, saying encouragingly
that death was the coward's refuge, sought only by those who had not the
resolution to meet, endure, or overcome the trials of life.She exhorted
me to courage, perseverance and self denial, saying that if I fought
life's battle bravely, I would have my reward.She changed all my clothes, and assisted me to put on a white dress
and cape, and a white cap and veil.She then gave me a card of good
behavior, embraced me for the last time, and led me out to the Bishop,
who was waiting to conduct me to the chapel where the ceremony was to be
performed.I there met ten other little girls, who, like myself, were compelled
to take upon themselves vows they did not understand, and thus, by an
apparently voluntary act, consign themselves to slavery for life.They
were all strangers to me, sent here, as I afterwards learned, from some
nunnery in Ireland, where they had friends who were too solicitous for
their welfare.The priests do not wish the nuns to see friends from the
world, and they will frame almost any plausible excuse to prevent it.But when the friends become too urgent, as they sometimes do, and their
inventive powers are taxed too severely, or if the task of furnishing so
many excuses become too irksome, the poor hapless victims are sent
off to some other nunnery, and the friends are told that they were not
contented, and wished to go to some other place, and that they, generous
creatures that they are, have at length, after much solicitation, kindly
consented to their removal.And this too, when they know that these very
girls are grieving their lives away, for a sight of those dear friends,
who, they are confidently assured, are either dead, or have entirely
forgotten them!Can the world of woe itself furnish deceit of a darker
dye?The Bishop led me up to the altar, and put a lighted candle into my
hand.He then went under the altar, on which a lighted candle was
placed, and soon returned followed by two little boys whom they called
apostles.They held, each, a lighted torch with which they proceeded to
light two more candles.On a table near the altar, stood a coffin, and
soon two priests entered, bearing another coffin, which they placed
beside the other.A white cloth was spread over them, and burning
candles placed at the head and foot.These movements frightened me
exceedingly, for I thought they were going to kill me.Forgetting in my terror that I was not allowed to speak, I asked the
Bishop if he was going to kill me.he exclaimed, "O no;
don't be frightened; I shall not hurt you in the least.But it is our
custom, when a nun takes the veil, to lay her in a coffin to show that
she is dead to the world.I told him
she did not, but I did not dare to tell him that I supposed she felt
so bad when she found I must leave her, that she entirely forgot it.He
then asked very pleasantly, which of the two coffins I liked the best,
saying I could have my choice.This was
true, for although he assured me to the contrary, I still believed he
was about to kill me, and I cared very little about my coffin.They were
both large enough for a grown person, and beautifully finished, with a
large silver plate on the lid.The Bishop took me up in his arms, and
laid me in one of them, and bade me close my eyes.I lay in that coffin a long time, as it seemed to me, without the least
motion.I was so much alarmed, I felt as though I could not even lift
a finger.Meantime the Bishop and priests read alternately from a book,
but in a language I could not understand.Occasionally they would come
and feel my hands and feet, and say to each other, "She is very cold."I believe they were afraid I should die in their hands, of fear.When
at last they took me up, they told me that I would carry that coffin
to Montreal with me--that I would be laid in it when robed for the
grave--and that my bones would moulder to dust in it.I shall never
forget the impression these words made on my mind.There was something
so horrible in the thought of carrying a coffin about with me all my
life, constantly reminding me of the shortness of time, and the sure
approach of death, I could not endure it.Gladly would I have left it,
costly and elegant as it was, choosing rather to run the risk of being
buried without one, but this was not allowed.I could have no choice in
the matter.I was taken to a small room, and a woman
assisted me to change my clothes again, and put on the Grey Nunnery
suit.This consisted of a grey dress and shoes, and a black cap.Each
nunnery has a peculiar dress which every nun is required to wear.Thus,
on meeting one of them, it is very easy to tell what establishment she
belongs to, and a run-away is easily detected.On leaving the chapel, I
was taken to the steamboat, with the other ten girls, accompanied by a
priest.Our coffins were packed in cotton, and placed on the boat with
us.On our arrival at Montreal, we found a priest and two nuns waiting
for us to conduct us to the nunnery.It is four
stories high, besides the basement.It occupies a large space of ground,
I do not know how much, but it is a very extensive building.The roof
is covered with tin, with a railing around it, finished at the top with
sharp points that look like silver, about a foot in length, and
three feet apart.Over the front door there is a porch covered with a
profusion of climbing plants, which give it a beautiful appearance.The building stands in a large yard, surrounded on all sides by a high
fence, so high indeed, that people who pass along the street can see
no part of the nunnery except the silver points on the roof.The top of
this fence is also finished with long iron spikes.Every thing around
the building seems expressly arranged to keep the inmates in, and
intruders out.In fact it would be nearly impossible for any one to gain
a forcible or clandestine admittance to any part of the establishment.There are several gates in the fence, how many I do not know, but the
front gate opens on St.Over each of the gates hangs a bell,
connected with the bells in the rooms of the Superior and Abbesses,
which ring whenever the gate is opened.There is always a guard of two
men at each gate, who walk up and down with guns upon their shoulders.While attempting to give a brief description of this building, I may as
well say that it is constructed with non-conductors between the walls,
so that the ringing of a bell, or the loudest shriek, could not be heard
from one room to the other.The reader will please bear this in mind, as
the reason for the precaution will appear in the course of my narrative.The priest, who met us as we left the boat, conducted us to the front
door and rang the bell.Soon a lady appeared, who drew a slide in the
middle of the door, exposing one pane of glass.Through this she looked,
to see who was there, and when satisfied on this point, opened the
door.Here let me remark, that since I left the nunnery, I have heard of
another class of people who find it convenient to have a slide in their
door; and if I am not very much mistaken, the character of the two
houses, or rather the people who live in them, are very much
alike, whether they are nunneries of private families, Catholics or
Protestants.Honest people have no need of a slide in the door, and
where there is so much precaution, may we not suppose that something
behind the curtain imperatively calls for it?It is an old adage, but
true notwithstanding, that "where there is concealment, there must be
something wrong."In the hall opposite the front door were two other doors, with a
considerable space between them.The right hand door was opened by the
door-tender, and we entered a room furnished in the plainest manner, but
every thing was neat, and in perfect order.Instead of chairs, on two
sides of the room a long bench was fastened to the sides of the house.They were neither painted, nor cushioned, but were very white, as was
also the floor, on which there was no carpet.Beside the door stood
a basin of holy water, and directly opposite, an image of the Saviour
extended on the cross which they call a crucifix.Here we were left a few moments, then the door-keeper came back, and
asked us if we would like to see the Black Cloisters; and if so, to
follow her.She led us back into the hall, and in the space between the
two doors that I mentioned, she unlocked a bar, and pulling it down,
touched a spring, and immediately a little square door slid back into
the ceiling.Across this door, or window or whatever they called it,
were strong bars of iron about one inch apart.Through this aperture
we were allowed to look, and a sad sight met my eyes.As many as fifty
disconsolate looking ladies were sitting there, who were called Black
Nuns, because they were preparing to take the Black Veil.They were all
dressed in black, a black cap on the head, and a white bandage drawn
across the forehead, to which another was attached, that passed under
the chin.These bandages they always wore, and were not allowed to lay
aside.They sat, each one with a book in her hand, motionless as so many
statues.Not a finger did they move, not an eye was raised, but they
sat gazing upon the page before them as intently as though life itself
depended upon it.Our guide informed us that they were studying the
[footnote] Black Book preparatory to taking the Black Veil and entering
the Cloister.It was very large, with a
white cover, and around the edge a black border about an inch wide.[Footnote: "The Black Book, or Praxis Sacra Romance Inquisitionis, is
always the model for that which is to succeed it.This book is a large
manuscript volume, in folio, and is carefully preserved by the head of
the Inquisition.It is called Libro Nero, the Black Book, because it
has a cover of that color; or, as an inquisitor explained to me, Libro
Necro, which, in the Greek language, signifies 'The book of the dead.'"In this book is the criminal code, with all the punishments for every
supposed crime; also the mode of conducting the trial, so as to elicit
the guilt of the accused; and the manner of receiving accusations.I had
this book in my hand on one occasion, and read therein the proceedings
relative to my own case; and I moreover saw in this same volume some
very astounding particulars; for example, in the list of punishments I
read concerning the bit, or as it is called by us THE MORDACCHIA, which
is a very simple contrivance to confine the tongue, and compress it
between two cylinders composed of iron and wood and furnished with
spikes.This horrible instrument not only wounds the tongue and
occasions excessive pain, but also, from the swelling it produces;
frequently places the sufferer in danger of suffocation.This torture is
generally had recourse to in cases considered as blasphemy against
God, the Virgin, the Saints, or the Pope.So that according to the
Inquisition, it is as great a crime to speak disparagingly of a pope,
who may be a very detestable character, as to blaspheme the holy name
of God.Be that as it may, this torture has been in use till the present
period; and, to say nothing of the exhibitions of this nature which were
displayed in Romanga, in the time of Gregory 16th., by the Inquisitor
Ancarani--in Umbria by Stefanelli, Salva, and others, we may admire
the inquisitorial seal of Cardinal Feretti, the cousin of his present
holiness, who condescended more than once to employ these means when he
was bishop of Rieti and Fermo."Dealings with the Inquisition, by the
Rev.Giacinto Achilli D. D., late Prior and Visitor of the Dominican
Order, Head Professor of Theology and Vicar of the master of the Sacred
Apostolic Palace, etc., etc., page 81.]Our curiosity being satisfied as far as possible, we returned to the
side room, where we waited long for the lady Superior.When at length
she came, she turned to me first, as I sat next the door, and asked me
if I had anything to show in proof of my former good character.I gave
her my card; she looked at it, and led me to the other side of the room.The same question was asked of every girl in turn, when it was found
that only four beside myself had cards of good behavior.The other six
presented cards which she said were for bad behavior.They were all
placed together on the other side of the room; and as the Superior was
about to lead them away, one of them came towards us saying that she
did not wish to stay with those girls, she would rather go with us.The Superior drew her back, and replied, "No, child; you cannot go with
those good girls; you would soon learn them some of your naughty ways.If you will do wrong, you must take the consequences."Then, seeing that
the child really felt very bad, she said, in a kinder tone, "When you
learn to do right, you shall be allowed to go with good girls, but not
before."I pitied the poor child, and for a long time I hoped to see her
come to our room; but she never came.They were all led off together,
and that was the last I ever saw of any of them.I was taken, with the other four girls, to a room on the second floor.Here we found five cribs, one for each of us, in which we slept.Our
food was brought to us regularly, consisting of one thin slice of fine
wheat bread for each of us, and a small cup of milk.It was only in
the morning, however, that the milk was allowed us, and for dinner and
supper we had a slice of bread and a cup of water.This was not half
enough to satisfy our hunger; but we could have no more.For myself I
can say that I was hungry all the time, and I know the others were also;
but we could not say so to each other.We were in that room together
five weeks, yet not one word passed between us.We did sometimes smile,
or shake our heads, or make some little sign, though even this was
prohibited, but we never ventured to speak.We were forbidden to do
so, on pain of severe punishment; and I believe we were watched all the
time, and kept there, for a trial of our obedience.We were employed in
peeling a soft kind of wood for beds, and filling the ticks with it.We
were directed to make our own beds, keep our room in the most perfect
order, and all our work in the middle of the floor.The Superior came up
every morning to see that we were thoroughly washed, and every Saturday
she was very particular to have our clothes and bed linen all changed.As every convenience was provided in our rooms or the closets adjoining,
we were not obliged to go out for anything, and for five weeks I did not
go out of that room.My bed was then brought from Quebec, and we were moved to a large square
room, with four beds in it, only two of which were occupied.We were
then sent to the kitchen, where in future, we were to be employed in
cleaning sauce, scouring knives and forks, and such work as we were able
to do.As we grew older, our tasks were increased with our strength.I
had no regular employment, but was called upon to do any of the drudgery
that was to be done about the house.The Superior came to the kitchen
every morning after prayers and told us what to do through the day.Then, in her presence we were allowed five minutes conversation, a
priest also being present.For the rest of the day we kept a profound
silence, not a word being spoken by any of us unless in answer to a
question from some of our superiors.In one part of the building there was a school for young ladies, who
were instructed in the various branches of education usually taught in
Catholic schools.Many of the scholars boarded at the nunnery, and all
the cooking and washing was done in the kitchen.We also did the cooking
for the saloons in Montreal.If this did not keep us employed, there
were corn brooms and brushes to make, and thus every moment was fully
occupied.Not a moment of leisure, no rest, no recreation, but hard
labor, and the still more laborious religious exercises, filled up the
time.It was sometimes very annoying to me to devote so many hours to
mere external forms; for I felt, even when very young, that they were
of little worth.But it was a severe trial to our temper to make so many
pies, cakes, puddings, and all kinds of rich food, which we were never
allowed to taste.The priests, superiors, and the scholars had every
luxury they desired; but the nuns, who prepared all their choice
dainties, were never permitted to taste anything but bread and water.I am well aware that this statement will seem incredible, and that
many will doubt the truth of it; but I repeat it: the nuns in the Grey
Nunnery, or at least those in the kitchen with me, were allowed no food
except bread and water, or, in case of illness, water gruel.The Grey Nunnery is said to be an orphan's home, and no effort is spared
to make visitors believe that this is the real character of the house.I suppose it is true that one part of it is devoted to this purpose; at
least my Superior informed me that many children were kept there; and
to those apartments visitors are freely admitted, but never to that part
occupied by the nuns.We were never allowed to communicate with people
from the world, nor with the children.In fact, during all the time I
was there, I never saw one of them, nor did I ever enter the rooms where
they were.In the ladies' school there were three hundred scholars, and in our
part of the house two hundred and fifty nuns, besides the children who
belonged to the nunnery.Add to these the abbesses, superiors, priests,
and bishop, and one will readily imagine that the work for such a family
was no trifling affair.In this nunnery the Bishop was the highest authority, and everything was
under his direction, unless the Pope's Nuncio, or some other high
church functionary was present.I sometimes saw one whom they called
the Archbishop, who was treated with great deference by the priests, and
even by the Bishop himself.The Holy Mother, or Lady Superior, has power over all who have taken or
are preparing to take the veil.Under her other superiors or abbesses
are appointed over the various departments, whose duty it is to look
after the nuns and novices, and the children in training for nuns.The
most rigid espionage is kept up throughout the whole establishment; and
if any of these superiors or abbesses fail to do the duty assigned
them, they are more severely punished than the nuns.Whenever the Lady
Superior is absent the punishments are assigned by one of the priests.Of these there were a large number in the nunnery; and whenever we
chanced to meet one of them, as we sometimes did when going about the
house, or whenever one of them entered the kitchen, we must immediately
fall upon our knees.No matter what we were doing, however busily
employed, or however inconvenient it might be, every thing must be
left or set aside, that this senseless ceremony might be performed.The
priest must be honored, and woe to the poor nun who failed to move with
sufficient alacrity; no punishment short of death itself was thought too
severe for such criminal neglect.Sometimes it would happen that I would
be engaged in some employment with my back to the door, and not observe
the entrance of a priest until the general movement around me would
arrest my attention; then I would hasten to "make my manners," as the
ceremony was called; but all too late.I had been remiss in duty, and no
excuse would avail, no apology be accepted, no forgiveness granted; the
dreaded punishment must come.While the nuns are thus severely treated, the priests, and the Holy
Mother live a very easy life, and have all the privileges they wish.So far as the things of this world are concerned, they seem to enjoy
themselves very well.But I have sometimes wondered if conscience did
not give them occasionally, an unpleasant twinge; and from some things I
have seen, I believe, that with many of them, this is the fact.They may
try to put far from them all thoughts of a judgment to come, yet I
do believe that their slumbers are sometimes disturbed by fearful
forebodings of a just retribution which may, after all, be in store for
them.But whatever trouble of mind they may have, they do not allow it
to interfere with their worldly pleasures, and expensive luxuries.They
have money enough, go when, and where they please, eat the richest food
and drink the choicest wines.In short, if sensual enjoyment was
the chief end of their existence, I do not know how they could act
otherwise.The Abbesses are sometimes allowed to go out, but not unless
they have a pass from one of the priests, and if, at any time, they have
reason to suspect that some one is discontented, they will not allow any
one to go out of the building without a careful attendant.My Superior here, as in the White Nunnery, was very kind to me.I
sometimes feared she would share the fate of Father Darity, for she had
a kind heart, and was guilty of many benevolent acts, which, if known,
would have subjected her to very serious consequences.I became so much
attached to her, that my fears for her were always alarmed when she
called me her good little girl, or used any such endearing expression.The sequel of my story will show that my fears were not unfounded; but
let me not anticipate.Sorrows will thicken fast enough, if we do not
hasten them.I lived with this Superior one year before I was consecrated, and it
was, comparatively, a happy season.I was never punished unless it was
to save me from less merciful hands; and then I would be shut up in a
closet, or some such simple thing.The other four girls who occupied the
room with me, were consecrated at the same time.The Bishop came to our room early one morning, and took us to the
chapel.At the door we were made to kneel, and then crawl on our hands
and knees to the altar, where sat a man, who we were told, was the
Archbishop.Two little boys came up from under the altar, with the
vesper lamp to burn incense.I suppose they were young Apostles, for
they looked very much like those we had seen at the White Nunnery, and
were dressed in the same manner.The Bishop turned his back, and they
threw incense on his head and shoulders, until he was surrounded by a
cloud of smoke.He bowed his head, smote upon his breast, and repeated
something in latin, or some other language, that we did not understand.We were told to follow his example, and did so, as nearly as possible.This ceremony over, the Bishop told us to go up on to the altar on our
knees, and when this feat was performed to his satisfaction, he placed a
crown of thorns upon each of our heads.These crowns were made of
bands of some firm material, which passed over the head and around the
forehead.On the inside thorns were fastened, with the points downward,
so that a very slight pressure would cause them to pierce the skin.This
I suppose is intended to imitate the crown of thorns which our Saviour
wore upon the cross.But what will it avail them to imitate the
crucifixion and the crown of thorns, while justice and mercy are so
entirely neglected?What will it avail to place a crown of thorns upon
a child's head, or to bid her kneel before the image of the Saviour, or
travel up stairs on her knees, while the way of salvation by Christ is
never explained to her; while of real religion, holiness of heart,
and purity of life she is as ignorant as the most benighted, degraded
heathen?Is it rational to suppose that the mere act of repeating
a prayer can heal the wounded spirit, or give peace to a troubled
conscience?Can the most cruel penance remove the sense of guilt, or
whisper hope to the desponding soul?I have tried it long enough
to speak with absolute certainty.For years I practiced these senseless
mummeries, and if there were any virtue, in them, I should, most
certainly have discovered it.But I know full well, and my reader knows
that they cannot satisfy the restless yearnings of the immortal mind.They may delude the vulgar, but they cannot dispel the darkness of the
tomb, they cannot lead a soul to Christ.On leaving the chapel after the ceremony, I found a new Superior,
waiting for us at the door to conduct us to our rooms.We were all very
much surprised at this, but she informed us that our old Superior died
that morning, that she was already buried, and she had come to take her
place.I could not believe this story, for she came to us as usual that
morning, appeared in usual health, though always very pale, and made no
complaint, or exhibited any signs of illness.She told us in her kind
and pleasant way that we were to be consecrated, gave us a few words of
advice, but said nothing about leaving us, and I do not believe she even
thought of such a thing.Little did I think, when she left us, that I
was never to see her again.In just two hours and a half
from that time, we were told that she was dead and buried, and another
filled her place!I wonder if they thought we
believed it!But whether we did or not, that was all we could ever know
about it.No allusion was ever made to the subject, and nuns are not
allowed to ask questions.However excited we might feel, no information
could we seek as to the manner of her death.Whether she died by
disease, or by the hand of violence; whether her gentle spirit
peacefully winged its way to the bosom of its God, or was hastily driven
forth upon the dagger's point, whether some kind friend closed her eyes
in death, and decently robed her cold limbs for the grave, or whether
torn upon the agonizing rack, whether she is left to moulder away in
some dungeon's gloom, or thrown into the quickly consuming fire, we
could never know.These, and many other questions that might have been
asked, will never be answered until the last great day, when the grave
shall give up its dead, and, the prison disclose its secrets.After the consecration we were separated, and only one of the girls
remained with me.We were put into a large
room, where were three beds, one large and two small ones.In the large
bed the Superior slept, while I occupied one of the small beds and the
other little nun the other.Our new Superior was very strict, and we
were severely punished for the least trifle--such, for instance, as
making a noise, either in our own room or in the kitchen.We might not
even smile, or make motions to each other, or look in each other's face.We must keep our eyes on our work or on the floor, in token of humility.To look a person full in the face was considered an unpardonable act of
boldness.On retiring for the night we were required to lie perfectly
motionless.We might not move a hand or foot, or even a finger.At
twelve the bell rang for prayers, when we must rise, kneel by our beds,
and repeat prayers until the second bell, when we again retired to rest.On cold winter nights these midnight prayers were a most cruel penance.It did seem as though I should freeze to death.But live or die, the
prayers must be said, and the Superior was always there to see that we
were not remiss in duty.If she slept at all I am sure it must have
been with one eye open, for she saw everything.But if I obeyed in this
thing, I found it impossible to lie as still as they required; I would
move when I was asleep without knowing it.This of course could not be
allowed, and for many weeks I was strapped down to my bed every night,
until I could sleep without the movement of a muscle.I was very anxious
to do as nearly right as possible, for I thought if they saw that I
strove with all my might to obey, they would perhaps excuse me if I did
fail to conquer impossibilities.In this, however, I was disappointed;
and I at length became weary of trying to do right, for they would
inflict severe punishments for the most trifling accident.In fact, if
I give anything like a correct account of my convent life, it will be
little else than a history of punishments.Pains, trials, prayers, and
mortifications filled up the time.Penance was the rule, to escape it
the exception.I neglected at the proper time to state what name was given me when I
took the veil; I may therefore as well say in this place that my convent
name was Sister Agnes.CONFESSION AND SORROW OF NO AVAIL.It was a part of my business to wait upon the priests in their rooms,
carry them water, clean towels, wine-glasses, or anything they needed.When entering a priest's room it was customary for a child to knock
twice, an adult four times, and a priest three times.This rule I
was very careful to observe.Whenever a priest opened the door I was
required to courtesy, and fall upon my knees; but if it was opened by
one of the waiters this ceremony was omitted.These waiters were the
boys I have before mentioned, called apostles.It was also a part of my
business to wait upon them, carry them clean frocks, etc.One day I was carrying a pitcher of water to one of the priests, and it
being very heavy, it required both my hands and nearly all my strength
to keep it upright.On reaching the door, however, I attempted to hold
it with one hand (as I dare not set it down), while I rapped with the
other.In so doing I chanced to spill a little water on the floor.Just
at that moment the door was opened by the priest himself, and when he
saw the water he was very angry.He caught me by the arm and asked what
punishment he should inflict upon me for being so careless.I attempted
to explain how it happened, told him it was an accident, that I was very
sorry, and would try to be more careful in future.But I might as well
have said that I was glad, and would do so again, for my confession,
sorrow, and promises of future obedience were entirely thrown away,
and might as well have been kept for some one who could appreciate the
feeling that prompted them.He immediately led me out of his room, it being on the second floor, and
down into the back yard.Here, in the centre of the gravel walk, was
a grate where they put down coal.This grate he raised and bade me
go down.I obeyed, and descending a few steps found myself in a coal
cellar, the floor being covered with it for some feet in depth.On this
we walked some two rods, perhaps, when the priest stopped, and with a
shovel that stood near cleared away the coal and lifted a trap door.Through this we descended four or five steps, and proceeded along
a dark, narrow passage, so low we could not stand erect, and the
atmosphere so cold and damp it produced the most uncomfortable
sensations.By the light of a small lantern which the priest carried in
his hand, I was enabled to observe on each side the passage small doors,
a few feet apart, as far as I could see.Some of them were open, others
shut, and the key upon the outside.In each of these doors there was
a small opening, with iron bars across it, through which the prisoner
received food, if allowed to have any.One of these doors I was directed
to enter, which I did with some difficulty, the place being so low, and
I was trembling with cold and fear.The priest crawled in after me
and tied me to the back part of the cell, leaving me there in midnight
darkness, and locking the door after him.I could hear on all sides, as
it seemed to me, the sobs, groans, and shrieks of other prisoners,
some of whom prayed earnestly for death to release them from their
sufferings.For twenty-four hours I was left to bear as I best could the pains and
terrors of cold, hunger, darkness, and fatigue.I could neither sit or
lie down, and every one knows how very painful it is to stand upon the
feet a long time, even when the position can be slightly changed; how
much more so when no change can be effected, but the same set of muscles
kept continually on the stretch for the space of twenty-four hours!Moreover, I knew not how long I should be kept there.The other
prisoners, whose agonizing cries fell upon my ears, were evidently
suffering all the horrors of starvation.Were those terrible sufferings in reserve for me?And then came the thought so often present with me while in the
convent, "If there is a God in heaven, why does He permit such things?What have I done that I should become the victim of such cruelty?I involuntarily exclaimed, "save me from this terrible death."At the close of twenty-four
hours, the Lady Superior came and released me from my prison, told me to
go to the priest and ask his forgiveness, and then go to my work in the
kitchen.I was very faint and weak from my long fast, and I resolved
never to offend again.I verily thought I could be careful enough to
escape another such punishment.But I had not been in the kitchen one
hour, when I chanced to let a plate fall upon the floor.It was in
no way injured, but I had broken the rules by making a noise, and the
Superior immediately reported me to the priest.He soon appeared with
his bunch of keys and a dark lantern in his hand.He took me by the ear
which he pinched till he brought tears to my eyes, saying, "You don't
try to do well, and I'll make you suffer the consequences."I did not
reply, for I had learned that to answer a priest, or seek to vindicate
myself, or even to explain how things came to be so, was in itself
a crime, to be severely punished.However unjust their treatment,
or whatever my feelings might be, I knew it was better to suffer in
silence.Unlocking a door that opened out of the kitchen, and still keeping hold
of my ear, he led me into a dark, gloomy hall, with black walls, and
opening a door on the right, he bade me enter.This room was lighted
by a candle, and around the sides, large iron hooks with heavy chains
attached to them, were driven into the wall.At the back part of the
room, he opened the door, and bade me enter a small closet.He then put
a large iron ring over my head, and pressed it down upon my shoulders.Heavy weights were placed in my hands, and I was told to stand up
straight, and hold them fifteen minutes.Had my
life depended upon the effort, I could not have stood erect, with those
weights in my hands.The priest, however, did not reprove me.Perhaps he
saw that I exerted all my strength to obey, for he took out his watch,
and slowly counted the minutes as they passed.Ere a third part of the
time expired, he was obliged to release me, for the blood gushed from
my nose and mouth, and I began to feel faint and dizzy.The irons were
removed, and the blood ceased to flow.I was then taken to another room, lighted like the other, but it was
damp and cold, and pervaded by a strong, fetid, and very offensive odor.The floor was of wood, and badly stained with blood.At least, I
thought it was blood, but there was not light enough to enable me to
say positively what it was.In the middle of the room, stood two long
tables, on each of which, lay a corpse, covered with a white cloth.The
priest led me to these tables, removed the cloth and bade me look upon
the face of the dead.They were very much emaciated, and the features,
even in death, bore the impress of terrible suffering.We stood there a
few moments, when he again led me back to his own room.He then asked
me what I thought of what I had seen.Having taken no food for more than
twenty-four hours, I replied, "I am so hungry, I can think of nothing
else.""How would you like to eat those dead bodies?""I would
starve, Sir, before I would do it," I replied.said he,
with a slight sneer."Yes indeed," I exclaimed, striving to suppress my
indignant feelings.Frightened at my own temerity in
speaking so boldly, I involuntarily raised my eye.The peculiar smile
upon his face actually chilled my blood with terror.He did not,
however, seem to notice me, but said, "Do not be too sure; I have seen
others quite as sure as you are, yet they were glad to do it to save
their lives; and remember," he added significantly, "you will do it too
if you are not careful."He then ordered me to return to the kitchen.At ten o'clock in the morning, the nuns had a slice of bread and cup
of water; but, as I had been fasting, they gave me a bowl of gruel,
composed of indian meal and water, with a little salt.A poor dinner
this, for a hungry person, but I could have no more.At eleven, we went
to mass in the chapel as usual.It was our custom to have mass
every day, and I have been told that this is true of all Romish
establishments.Returning to my work in the kitchen, I again resolved
that I would be so careful, that, in future they should have no cause
for complaint For two days I succeeded.Yes, for two whole days, I
escaped punishment.This I notice as somewhat remarkable, because I was
generally punished every day, and sometimes two or three times in a day.On the third morning, I was dusting the furniture in the room occupied
by the priest above mentioned, who treated me so cruelly.The floor
being uncarpeted, in moving the chairs I chanced to make a slight noise,
although I did my best to avoid it.He immediately sprang to his feet,
exclaiming, "You careless dog!Then taking me
by the arms, he gave me a hard shake, saying, "Have I not told you that
you would be punished, if you made a noise?But I see how it is with
you; your mind is on the world, and you think more of that, than you do
of the convent.But I shall punish you until you do your duty better."He concluded this choice speech by telling me to "march down stairs."Of
course, I obeyed, and he followed me, striking me on the head at every
step, with a book he held in his hand.I thought to escape some of the
blows, and hastened along, but all in vain; he kept near me and drove
me before him into the priests sitting-room.He then sent for three more
priests, to decide upon my punishment.A long consultation they held
upon "this serious business," as I sneeringly thought it, but the result
was serious in good earnest, I assure you.For the heinous offence of
making a slight noise I was to have dry peas bound upon my knees, and
then be made to crawl to St.Patrick's church, through an underground
passage, and back again.This church was situated on a hill, a little
more than a quarter of a mile from the convent.Between the two
buildings, an under-ground passage had been constructed, just large
enough to allow a person to crawl through it on the hands and knees.It
was so low, and narrow, that it was impossible either to rise, or turn
around; once within that passage there was no escape, but to go on to
the end.They allowed me five hours to go and return; and to prove that
I had really been there, I was to make a cross, and two straight lines,
with a bit of chalk, upon a black-board that I should find at the end.O, the intolerable agonies I endured on that terrible pathway!Any
description that I can give, will fail to convey the least idea of the
misery of those long five hours.It may, perchance, seem a very simple
mode of punishment, but let any one just try it, and they will be
convinced that it was no trifling thing.At the end, I found myself in
a cellar under the church, where there was light enough to enable me to
find the board and the chalk.I made the mark according to orders, and
then looked around for some means of escape.Strong iron bars firmly secured the only door, and a very slight
examination convinced me that my case was utterly hopeless.I then tried
to remove the peas from my swollen, bleeding limbs, but this, too, I
found impossible.They were evidently fastened by a practised hand; and
I was, at length, compelled to believe that I must return as I came.I
did return; but O, how, many times I gave up in despair, and thought
I could go no further!How many times did I stretch myself on the cold
stones, in such bitter agony, that I could have welcomed death as a
friend and deliverer!What would I not have given for one glass of cold
water, or even for a breath of fresh air!My limbs seemed on fire,
and while great drops of perspiration fell from my face, my throat and
tongue were literally parched with thirst.But the end came at last, and
I found the priest waiting for me at the entrance.He seemed very angry,
and said, "You have been gone over your time.There was no need of it;
you could have returned sooner if you had chosen to do so, and now,
I shall punish you again, for being gone so long."At first, his
reproaches grieved me, for I had done my best to please him, and I did
so long for one word of sympathy, it seemed for a moment, as though my
heart would break.Had he then spoken one kind word to me, or manifested
the least compassion for my sufferings, I could have forgiven the past,
and obeyed him with feelings of love and gratitude for the future.Yes,
I would have done anything for that man, if I could have felt that he
had the least pity for me; but when he said he should punish me again,
my heart turned to stone.Every tender emotion vanished, and a fierce
hatred, a burning indignation, and thirst for revenge, took possession
of my soul.The priest removed the peas from my limbs, and led me to a tomb under
the chapel, where he left me, with the consoling assurance that "THE
DEAD WOULD RISE AND EAT ME!"This tomb was a large rectangular room,
with shelves on three sides of it, on which were the coffins of priests
and Superiors who had died in the nunnery.On the floor under the
shelves, were large piles of human bones, dry and white, and some of
them crumbling into dust.In the center of the room was a large tank of
water, several feet in diameter, called St.It occupied
the whole center of the room leaving a very narrow pathway between that,
and the shelves; so narrow, indeed, that I found it impossible to sit
down, and exceedingly difficult to walk or even stand still.I was
obliged to hold firmly by the shelves, to avoid slipping into the water
which looked dark and deep.The priest said, when he left me, that if I
fell in, I would drown, for no one could take me out.O, how my heart thrilled with superstitious terror when I heard the key
turn in the lock, and realized that I was alone with the dead!And that
was not the worst of it.For a few hours
I stood as though paralyzed with fear.A cold perspiration covered my
trembling limbs, as I watched those coffins with the most painful and
serious apprehension.Every moment I expected the fearful catastrophe,
and even wondered which part they would devour first--whether one would
come alone and thus kill me by inches, or whether they would all rise
at once, and quickly make an end of me.I even imagined I could see the
coffins move--that I heard the dead groan and sigh and even the sound of
my own chattering teeth, I fancied to be a movement among the dry bones
that lay at my feet.In the extremity of terror I shrieked aloud.Or who would care if
they did hear?I was surrounded by walls that no sound could penetrate,
and if it could, it would fall upon ears deaf to the agonizing cry for
mercy,--upon hearts that feel no sympathy for human woe.Some persons may be disposed to smile at this record of absurd and
superstitions fear.Had not the
priest said that the dead would rise and eat me?And did I not firmly
believe that what he said was true?I thought it could not be; yet as hour after hour passed
away, and no harm came to me, I began to exercise my reason a little,
and very soon came to the conclusion that the priests are not the
immaculate, infallible beings I had been taught to believe.Cruel
and hard hearted, I knew them to be, but I did not suspect them of
falsehood.Hitherto I had supposed it was impossible for them to do
wrong, or to err in judgement; all their cruel acts being done for the
benefit of the soul, which in some inexplicable way was to be benefited
by the sufferings of the body.Now, however, I began to question the
truth of many things I had seen and heard, and ere long I lost all faith
in them, or in the terrible system of bigotry, cruelty and fraud, which
they call religion.As the hours passed by and my fears vanished before the calm light of
reason, I gradually gained sufficient courage to enable me to examine
the tomb, thinking that I might perchance discover the body of my old
Superior.For this purpose I accordingly commenced the circuit of the
room, holding on by the shelves, and making my way slowly onward.One
coffin I succeeded in opening, but the sight of the corpse so frightened
me, I did not dare to open another.The room being brilliantly lighted
with two large spermaceti candles at one end, and a gas burner at the
other, I was enabled to see every feature distinctly.One of the nuns informed me that none but priests and Superiors are laid
in that tomb.When these die in full communion with the church, the body
is embalmed, and placed here, but it sometimes happens that a priest or
Superior is found in the convent who does not believe all that is taught
by the church of Rome.They desire to investigate the subject--to seek
for more light--more knowledge of the way of salvation by Christ.This,
with the Romanists is a great sin, and the poor hapless victim is at
once placed under punishment.If they die in this condition, their
bodies are cast out as heretics, but if they confess and receive
absolution, they are placed in the tomb, but not embalmed.The flesh, of
course, decays, and then the bones are thrown under the shelves.Never
shall I forget how frightful those bones appeared to me, or the cold
shudder that thrilled my frame at the sight of the numerous human skulls
that lay scattered around.Twenty-four hours I spent in this abode of the dead, without rest or
sleep.The attempt to obtain either would have been sheer madness, for
the least mis-step, the least unguarded motion, or a slight relaxation
of the firm grasp by which I held on to the shelves, would have plunged
me headlong into the dark water, from which escape would have been
impossible.For thirty hours I had not tasted food, and my limbs,
mangled and badly swollen, were so stiff with long standing, that, when
allowed to leave the tomb, I could hardly step.When the priest came to
let me out, he seemed to think it necessary to say something to cover
his attempt to deceive and frighten me, but he only made a bad matter
worse.He said that after he left me, he thought he would try me once
more, and see if I would not do my duty better; he had, therefore,
WILLED THE DEAD NOT TO EAT ME!AND THEY, OBEDIENT TO HIS WILL, WERE
COMPELLED TO LET ME ALONE!I did not reply to this absurd declaration,
lest I should say something I ought not, and again incur his
displeasure.Indeed, I was not expected to say anything, unless I
returned thanks for his unparalleled kindness, and I was not hypocrite
enough for that.I suppose he thought I believed all he said, but he was
greatly mistaken.If I began to doubt his word while in the tomb, this
ridiculous pretence only served to add contempt to unbelief, and from
that time I regarded him as a deceiver, and a vile, unscrupulous,
hypocritical pretender.It was with the greatest difficulty that I again made my way to the
kitchen.I was never very strong, even when allowed my regular meals,
for the quantity, was altogether insufficient, to satisfy the demands
of nature; and now I had been so long without anything to eat, I was
so weak, and my limbs so stiff and swollen, I could hardly stand.I
managed, however, to reach the kitchen, when I was immediately seated at
the table and presented with a bowl of gruel.O, what a luxury it seemed
to me, and how eagerly did I partake of it!It was soon gone, and I
looked around for a further supply.Another nun, who sat at the table
with me, with a bowl of gruel before her, noticed my disappointment when
I saw that I was to have no more.She was a stranger to me, and so pale
and emaciated she looked more like a corpse than a living person.She
had tasted a little of her gruel, but her stomach was too weak to retain
it, and as soon as the Superior left us she took it up and poured the
whole into my bowl, making at the same time a gesture that gave me to
understand that it was of no use to her, and she wished me to eat it I
did not wait for a second invitation, and she seemed pleased to see me
accept it so readily.We dared not speak, but we had no difficulty in
understanding each other.I had but just finished my gruel when the Superior came back and desired
me to go up stairs and help tie a mad nun.I think she did this simply
for the purpose of giving me a quiet lesson in convent life, and showing
me the consequences of resistance or disobedience.She must have known
that I was altogether incapable of giving the assistance she pretended
to ask.But I followed her as fast as possible, and when she saw how
difficult it was for me to get up stairs, she walked slowly and gave me
all the time I wished for.She led me into a small room and closed the
door.There I beheld a scene that called forth my warmest sympathy,
and at the same time excited feelings of indignation that will never be
subdued while reason retains her throne.In the center of the room sat
a young girl, who could not have been more than sixteen years old; and a
face and form of such perfect symmetry, such surpassing beauty, I never
saw.She was divested of all her clothing except one under-garment, and
her hands and feet securely tied to the chair on which she sat.A priest
stood beside her, and as we entered he bade us assist him in removing
the beds from the bedstead.They then took the nun from her chair and
laid her on the bedcord.They desired me to assist them, but my heart
failed me.I could not do it, for I was sure they were about to kill
her; and as I gazed upon those calm, expressive features, so pale and
sad, yet so perfectly beautiful, I felt that it would be sacrilege for
me to raise my hand against nature's holiest and most exquisite work.I
therefore assured them that I was too weak to render the assistance they
required.At first they attempted to compel me to do it; but, finding
that I was really very weak, and unwilling to use what strength I had,
they at length permitted me to stand aside.When they extended the poor
girl on the cord, she said, very quietly, "I am not mad, and you know
that I am not."To this no answer was given, but they calmly proceeded
with their fiendish work.One of them tied her feet, while the other
fastened a rope across her neck in such a way that if she attempted to
raise her head it would strangle her.The rope was then fastened under
the bedcord, and two or three times over her person.Her arms were
extended, and fastened in the same way.As she lay thus, like a lamb
bound for the sacrifice, she looked up at her tormentors and said, "Will
the Lord permit me to die in this cruel way?"The priest immediately
exclaimed, in an angry tone, "Stop your talk, you mad woman!"and
turning to me, he bade me go back to the kitchen.It is probable he saw
the impression on my mind was not just what they desired, therefore he
hurried me away.All this time the poor doomed nun submitted quietly to her fate.I
suppose she thought it useless, yea, worse than useless, to resist; for
any effort she might make to escape would only provoke them, and they
would torment her the more.I presume she thought her last hour had
come, and the sooner she was out of her misery the better.As for me,
my heart was so filled with terror, anguish, and pity for her, I could
hardly obey the command to leave the room.I attempted to descend the stairs, but was obliged to go very slowly on
account of the stiffness of my limbs, and before I reached the bottom of
the first flight the priest and the Superior came out into the hall.I
heard them whispering together, and I paused to listen.This, I know,
was wrong; but I could not help it, and I was so excited I did not
realize what I was doing.My anxiety for that girl overpowered every
other feeling.At first I could only hear the sound of their voices; but
soon they spoke more distinctly, and I heard the words.In an audible tone of voice, the
other replied, "We had better finish her."I knew well enough that they designed "to finish her," but to hear
the purpose announced so coolly, it was horrible.Was there no way that
I could save her?Must I stand there, and know that a fellow-creature
was being murdered, that a young girl like myself, in all the freshness
of youth and the fullness of health, was to be cut off in the very
prime of life and numbered with the dead; hurried out of existence and
plunged, unwept, unlamented, into darkness and silence?She had friends,
undoubtedly, but they would never be allowed to know her sad fate, never
shed a tear upon her grave!I felt that
if I lingered there another moment I should be in danger of madness
myself; for I could not help her.I could not prevent the consummation
of their cruel purpose; I therefore hastened away, and this was the last
I ever heard of that poor nun.I had never seen her before, and as I did
not see her clothes, I could not even tell whether she belonged to our
nunnery or not.CHAPTER X.

THE SICK NUN.On my return to the kitchen I found the sick nun sitting as we left her.She asked me, by signs, if we were alone.I told her she need not fear
to speak, for the Superior was two flights of stairs above, and no one
else was near.I assured her that
we were quite alone, that she had nothing to fear.She then informed me
that she had been nine days under punishment, that when taken from the
cell she could not stand or speak, and she was still too weak to walk
without assistance.said she, and the big tears rolled over her
cheeks as she said it, "I have not a friend in the world.You do not
know how my heart longs for love, for sympathy and kindness."I asked if
she had not parents, or friends, in the world.She replied, "I was born
in this convent, and know no world but this.You see," she continued,
with a sad smile, "what kind of friends I have here.O, if I HAD A
FRIEND, if I could feel that one human being cares for me, I should get
better.But it is so long since I heard a kind word--" a sob choked her
utterance.I told her I would be a friend to her as far as I could.She
thanked me; said she was well aware of the difficulties that lay in my
way, for every expression of sympathy or kind feeling between the nuns
was strictly forbidden, and if caught in anything of the kind a severe
correction would follow."But," said she "if you will give me a kind
look sometimes, whenever you can do so with safety, it will be worth a
great deal to me.You do not know the value of a kind look to a breaking
heart."She wept so bitterly, I feared it would injure her health, and to divert
her mind, I told her where I was born; spoke of my childhood, and of
my life at the White Nunnery.She wiped away her tears, and replied, "I
know all about it.I have heard the priests talk about you, and they say
that your father is yet living, that your mother was a firm protestant,
and that it will be hard for them to beat Catholicism into you.But I
do not know how you came in that nunnery.I told her
that I was placed there by my father, when only six years old.she exclaimed, and then added passionately, "Curse your
father for it."After a moments silence, she continued, "Yes, child;
you have indeed cause to curse your father, and the day when you first
entered the convent; but you do not suffer as much as you would if you
had been born here, and were entirely dependent on them.They fear
that your friends may sometime look after you; and, in case they are
compelled to grant them an interview, they would wish them to find you
in good health and contented; but if you had no influential friends
outside the convent, you would find yourself much worse off than you are
now."She then said she wished she could get some of the brandy from the
cellar.Her stomach was so weak from long fasting, it would retain
neither food or drink, and she thought the brandy would give it
strength.She asked if I could get it for her.The idea frightened me at
first, for I knew that if caught in doing it, I should be most cruelly
punished, yet my sympathy for her at length overcame my fears, and I
resolved to try, whatever might be the result.I accordingly went up
stairs, ostensibly, to see if the Superior wanted me, but really, to
find out where she was, and whether she would be likely to come down,
before I could have time to carry out my plan.I trembled a little,
for I knew that I was guilty of a great misdemeanor in thus boldly
presenting myself to ask if I was wanted; but I thought it no very great
sin to pretend that I thought she called me, for I was sure my motives
were good, whatever they might think of them.I had been taught that
"the end sanctifies the means," and I thought I should not be too hardly
judged by the great searcher of hearts, if, for once, I applied it in my
own way.I knocked gently at the door I had left but a few moments before.It was
opened by the Superior, but she immediately stepped out, and closed it
again, so that I had no opportunity to see what was passing within.She sternly bade me return to the kitchen, and stay there till she came
down; a command I was quite ready to obey.In the kitchen there was a
small cupboard, called the key cupboard, in which they kept keys of all
sizes belonging to the establishment.They were hung on hooks, each one
being marked with the name of the place to which it belonged.It was
easy for me to find the key to the cellar, and having obtained it, I
opened another cupboard filled with bottles and vials, where I selected
one that held half a pint, placed it in a large pitcher, and hastened
down stairs.I soon found a cask marked "brandy," turned the faucet, and
filled the bottle.But my heart beat violently, and my hand trembled
so that I could not hold it steady, and some of it ran over into the
pitcher.It was well for me that I took this precaution, for if I had
spilt it on the stone floor of the cellar, I should have been detected
at once.I ran up stairs as quickly as possible, and made her drink what
I had in the pitcher, though there was more of it than I should have
given her under other circumstances; but I did not know what to do
with it.If I put it in the fire, or in the sink, I thought they would
certainly smell it, and, there was no other place, for I was not allowed
to go out of doors.I then replaced the key, washed up my pitcher, and
secreted the bottle of brandy in the waist of the nun's dress.This
I could easily do, their dresses being made with a loose waist, and a
large cape worn over them.I then began to devise some way to destroy
the scent in the room.I could smell it very distinctly, and I knew that
the Superior would notice it at once.After trying various expedients to
no purpose, I at length remembered that I had once seen a dry rag set on
fire for a similar purpose.I therefore took one of the cloths from the
sink, and set it on fire, let it burn a moment, and threw it under the
caldron.I was just beginning to congratulate myself on my success, when I saw
that the nun appeared insensible, and about to fall from her chair.I
caught her in my arms, and leaned her back in the chair, but I did not
dare to lay her on the bed, without permission, even if I had strength
to do it.I could only draw her chair to the side of the room, put a
stick of wood under it, and let her head rest against the wall.I was
very much frightened, and for a moment, thought she was dead.She was
pale as a corpse, her eyes closed, and her mouth wide open.I soon found that
she was not dead, for her heart beat regularly, and I began to hope she
would get over it before any one came in.But just as the thought passed
my mind, the door opened and the Superior appeared.Her first words
were, "What have you been burning?I told her there was
a cloth about the sink that I thought unfit for use, and I put it
under the caldron.She then turned towards the nun and asked if she had
fainted.I told her that I did not know, but I thought she was asleep,
and if she wished me to awaken, and assist her to bed, I would do so.To
this she consented, and immediately went up stairs again.Glad as I was
of this permission, I still doubted my ability to do it alone, for I had
little, very little strength; yet I resolved to do my best.It was long,
however, before I could arouse her, or make her comprehend what I said,
so entirely were her senses stupified with the brandy.When at length I
succeeded in getting her upon her feet, she said she was sure she could
not walk; but I encouraged her to help herself as much as possible, told
her that I wished to get her away before any one came in, or we would
be certainly found out and punished.This suggestion awakened her fears,
and I at length succeeded in assisting her to bed.She was soon in a
sound sleep, and I thought my troubles for that time were over.In my fright, I had quite forgotten the brandy in her
dress.Somehow the bottle was cracked, and while she slept, the brandy
ran over her clothes.The Superior saw it, and asked how she obtained
it.Too noble minded to expose me, she said she drew it herself.I
heard the Superior talking to a priest about it, and I thought they were
preparing to punish her.I did not know what she had told them, but I
did not think she would expose me, and I feared, if they punished her
again, she would die in their hands.I therefore went to the Superior and told her the truth about it, for
I thought a candid confession on my part might, perchance, procure
forgiveness for the nun, if not for myself.But no; they punished us
both; the nun for telling the lie, and me for getting the brandy.For
two hours they made me stand with a crown of thorns on my head, while
they alternately employed themselves in burning me with hot irons,
pinching, and piercing me with needles, pulling my hair, and striking
me with sticks.All this I bore very well, for I was hurt just enough to
make me angry.When I returned to the kitchen again, the nun was sitting there alone.She shook her head at me, and by her gestures gave me to understand that
some one was listening.She afterwards informed me that the Superior was
watching us, to see if we would speak to each other when we met.I do
not know how they punished her, but I heard a priest say that she would
die if she suffered much more.Perhaps they thought the loss of that
precious bottle of brandy was punishment enough.But I was glad I got
it for her, for she had one good dose of it, and it did her good;
her stomach was stronger, her appetite better, and in a few weeks she
regained her usual health.One day, while at work as usual, I was called up stairs with the other
nuns to see one die.She lay upon the bed, and looked pale and thin, but
I could see no signs of immediate dissolution.Her voice was strong, and
respiration perfectly natural, the nuns were all assembled in her room
to see her die.Beside her stood a priest, earnestly exhorting her to
confess her sins to him, and threatening her with eternal punishment if
she refused.But she replied, "No, I will not confess to you.If, as
you say, I am really dying, it is with my God I have to do; to him alone
will I confess, for he alone can save.""If you do not confess to me,"
exclaimed the priest, "I will give you up to the devil.""Well," said
she, "I stand in no fear of a worse devil than you are, and I am quite
willing to leave you at any time, and try any other place; even hell
itself cannot be worse.I cannot suffer more there than I have here.""Daughter," exclaimed the priest, with affected sympathy, "must I give
you up?How can I see you go down to perdition?"I have already confessed my sins to God,
and I shall confess to no one else.Her manner of
saying this was solemn but very decided.The priest saw that she would
not yield to his wishes, and raising his voice, he exclaimed, "Then let
the devil take you."Immediately the door opened, and a figure representing the Roman
Catholic idea of his Satanic Majesty entered the room.He was very
black, and covered with long hair, probably the skin of some wild
animal.He had two long white tusks, two horns on his head, a large
cloven foot, and a long tail that he drew after him on the floor.He
looked so frightful, and recalled to my mind so vividly the figure that
I saw at the White Nunnery, that I was very much frightened; still I did
not believe it was really a supernatural being.I suspected that it was
one of the priests dressed up in that way to frighten us, and I now
know that such was the fact.We all feared the priests
quite as much as we should the Evil One himself, even if he should come
to us in bodily shape, as they pretended he had done.Most of the nuns
were very much frightened when they saw that figure walk up to the
bedside, taking good care, however, to avoid the priest, he being so
very holy it was impossible for an evil spirit to go near or even look
at him.The priest then ordered us to return to the kitchen, for said he, "The
devil has come for this nun's soul, and will take it with him," As we
left the room I looked around on my companions and wondered if they
believed this absurd story.I longed to ask them what they thought of
it, but this was not allowed.All interchange of thought or feeling
being strictly forbidden, we never ventured to speak without permission
when so many of us were present, for some one was sure to tell of it if
the least rule was broken.I was somewhat surprised at first that we were all sent to the kitchen,
as but few of us were employed there; but we were soon called back again
to look at the corpse.I was inexpressibly shocked at this summons, for
I had not supposed it possible for her to die so soon.But she was dead;
and that was all we could ever know about it.As we stood around the
bed, the priest said she was an example of those in the world called
heretics; that her soul was in misery, and would remain so forever; no
masses or prayers could avail her then, for she could never be prayed
out of hell.I continued to work in the kitchen as usual for many months after this
occurrence, and for a few weeks the sick nun was there a great part of
the time.Whenever we were alone, and sure that no one was near, we used
to converse together, and a great comfort it was to us both.I felt that
I had found in her one real friend, to sympathize with me in my grievous
trials, and with whom I could sometimes hold communication without fear
of betrayal.I had proved her, and found her faithful, therefore I
did not fear to trust her.No one can imagine, unless they know by
experience, how much pleasure we enjoyed in the few stolen moments that
we spent together.I shall never forget the last conversation I had with her.She came and
sat down where I was assisting another nun to finish a mat.She asked
us if we knew what was going on in the house."As I came from my room,"
said she, "I saw the priests and Superiors running along the halls, and
they appeared so much excited, I thought something must be wrong.As
they passed me, they told me to go to the kitchen, and stay there.Of course we did not know, for we had neither seen or
heard anything unusual."Well," said she, "they are all so much engaged
up stairs, we can talk a little and not be overheard.I want to know
something about the people in the world.Are they really cruel and
cold-hearted, as the priests say they are?When you was in the world
were they unkind to you?""On the contrary," I replied, "I would gladly
return to them again if I could get away from the convent.I should
not be treated any worse, at all events, and I shall embrace the-first
opportunity to go back to the world.""That is what I have always
thought since I was old enough to think at all," said she, "and I have
resolved a great many times to get away if possible.I suppose they tell
us about the cruelty in the world just to frighten us, and prevent us
from trying to escape.I am so weak now I do not suppose I could walk
out of Montreal even if I should leave the convent.But if I ever get
strong enough, I shall certainly try to escape from this horrible place.O, I could tell you things about this convent that would curdle the
blood in your veins."The other nun said that she had been once in the world, and every one
was kind to her."I shall try to get out again, some day," said she,
"but we must keep our resolutions to ourselves, for there is no one
here, that we can trust.Those whom we think our best friends will
betray us, if we give them a chance.I do believe that some of them
delight in getting us punished."The sick nun said, "I have never exposed any one and I never will.I
have the secrets of a great many hid in my breast, that nothing shall
ever extort from me."Here she was interrupted, and soon left the room.Whether she was under punishment, or was so
fortunate as to make her escape, I do not know.As no questions could
be asked, it was very little we could know of each other.If one of our
number escaped, the fact was carefully concealed from the rest, and if
she was caught and brought back, no one ever knew it, except those who
had charge of her.The other nun who worked in the room with me, watched
me very closely.Having heard me declare my intention to leave the first
opportunity, she determined to go with me if possible.At length the long sought opportunity arrived, and with the most extatic
joy we fled from the nunnery.The girl I have before mentioned, who
wished to go with me, and another nun, with whom I had no acquaintance,
were left in the kitchen to assist me, in taking charge of the cooking,
while the rest of the people were at mass in the chapel.A chance
presented for us to get away, and we all fled together, leaving the
cooking to take care of itself.We were assisted to get out of the yard,
but how, or by whom, I can never reveal.Death, in its most terrible
form would be the punishment for such an act of kindness, and knowing
this, it would be the basest ingratitude for me to name the individual
who so kindly assisted us in our perilous undertaking.How well do I remember the emotions that thrilled my soul when I found
myself safely outside the walls of that fearful prison!The joy of
freedom--the hope of ultimate success--the fear of being overtaken,
and dragged back to misery or death, were considerations sufficiently
exciting to agitate our spirits, and lend fleetness to our steps.With
trembling limbs, and throbbing hearts we fled towards the St.Following the tow-path, we hastened on for a few miles, when one
of the nuns became exhausted, and said she could go no further.She
was very weak when we started, and the excitement and fatigue produced
serious illness.We could not take her along
with us, and if we stopped with her, we might all be taken and carried
back.Must we leave her by the way-side?It was a fearful alternative,
but what else could we do?With sad hearts we took her to a shed near
by, and there we left her to her fate, whatever it might be; perchance
to die there alone, or what was still worse, be carried back to the
convent.It was indeed, a sorrowful parting, and we wept bitter tears
together, as we bade her a last farewell.I never saw or heard from her
again.We pursued our way along the tow-path for a short distance, when the
canal boat came along.We asked permission to go upon the boat, and the
captain kindly granted it, but desired us to be very still.He carried
us twelve miles, and then proposed to leave us, as he exposed himself to
a heavy fine by carrying us without a pass, and unattended by a priest
or Superior.We begged him to take us as far as he went with the boat,
and frankly told him our situation.Having no money to offer, we could
only cast ourselves on his mercy, and implore his pity and assistance.He consented to take us as far as the village of Beauharnois, and there
he left us.He did not dare take us further, lest some one might be
watching for us, and find us on his boat.It was five o'clock in the morning when we left the boat, but it was
a Roman Catholic village, and we did not dare to stop.All that day we
pursued our way without food or drink, and at night we were tired and
hungry.Arriving at a small village, we ventured to stop at the most
respectable looking house, and asked the woman if she could keep us over
night.She looked at us very attentively and said she could not.We did
not dare to call again, for we knew that we were surrounded by those who
would think they were doing a good work to deliver us up to the priests.Darkness came over the earth, but still weary and sleepy as we were, we
pursued our lonely way.I will not repeat our bitter reflections upon a
cold hearted world, but the reader will readily imagine what they were.Late in the evening, we came to an old barn.I think it must have
been four or five miles from the village.There was no house, or other
building near it, and as no person was in sight, we ventured to enter.Here, to our great joy, we found a quantity of clean straw, with which
we soon prepared a comfortable bed, where we could enjoy the luxury of
repose.We slept quietly through the night, and at the early dawn awoke,
refreshed and encouraged, but O, so hungry!Gladly would we have eaten
anything in the shape of food, but nothing could we find.The morning star was yet shining brightly above us, as we again started
on our journey.At length our hearts were cheered by the sight of a
village.The first house we came to stood at some distance from the
other buildings, and we saw two women in a yard milking cows.We called
at the door, and asked the lady for some milk."O yes," said she, with
a sweet smile, "come in, and rest awhile, and you shall have all you
want."She thought we were Sisters of Charity, for they often go about
visiting the sick, and praying with the people.It is considered a very
meritorious act to render them assistance, and speed them on their way;
but to help a runaway nun is to commit a crime of sufficient magnitude
to draw down the anathema of the church.Therefore, while we carefully
concealed our real character, we gratefully accepted the aid we so much
needed, but which, we were sure, would have been withheld had she known
to whom it was offered.After waiting till the cows were milked, and
she had finished her own breakfast, she filled a large earthen pan
with bread and milk, gave each of us a spoon, and we ate as much as
we wished.As we arose to depart, she gave each of us a large piece of
bread to carry with us, and asked us to pray with her.We accordingly
knelt in prayer; implored heaven's blessing on her household, and then
took our leave of this kind lady, never more to meet her on earth; but
she will never be forgotten.That day we traveled a long distance, at least, so it seemed to us.When
nearly overcome with fatigue, we saw from the tow-path an island in the
river, and upon it a small house.Near the shore a man stood beside a
canoe.We made signs to him to come to us, and he immediately sprang
into his canoe and came over.We asked him to take us to the island, and
he cheerfully granted our request, but said we must sit very still, or
we would find ourselves in the water.I did not wonder he thought so,
for the canoe was very small, and the weight of three persons sank it
almost even with the surface of the river, while the least motion would
cause it to roll from side to side, so that we really felt that we were
in danger of a very uncomfortable bath if nothing worse.We landed safely, however, and were kindly welcomed by the Indian
family in the house.Six squaws were sitting on the floor, some of them
smoking, others making shoes and baskets.They were very gayly dressed,
their skirts handsomely embroidered with beads and silk of various
colors.One of the girls seemed very intelligent, and conversed fluently
in the English language which she spoke correctly.But she did not
look at all like an Indian, having red hair and a lighter skin than the
others.She was the only one in the family that I could converse with,
as the rest of them spoke only their native dialect; but the nun who was
with me could speak both French and Indian.They treated us with great kindness, gave us food, and invited in to
stay and live with them; said we could be very happy there, and to
induce us to remain, they informed us that the village we saw on the
other side of the river, called St.Regis, was inhabited by Indians, but
they were all Roman Catholics.They had a priest, and a church where
we could go to Mass every Sabbath.Little did they imagine that we were
fleeing for life from the Romish priests; that so far from being an
inducement to remain with them, this information was the very thing to
send us on our way with all possible speed.We did not dare to stay,
for I knew full well that if any one who had seen us went to confession,
they would be obliged to give information of our movements; and if one
priest heard of us, he would immediately telegraph to all the priests
in the United States and Canada, and we should be watched on every side.Escape would then be nearly impossible, therefore we gently, but firmly
refused to accept the hospitality of these good people, and hastened to
bid them farewell.I asked the girl how far it was to the United States.She said it was
two miles to Hogansburg, and that was in the States.We then asked the
man to take us in his canoe to the village of St.Regis on the other
side of the river.He consented, but, I thought, with some reluctance,
and before he allowed us to land, he conversed some minutes with the
Indians who met him on the shore.We could not hear what they said, but
my fears were at once awakened.I thought they suspected us, and if so,
we were lost.But the man came back at length, and, assisted us from the
boat.If he had any suspicions he kept them to himself.Soon after we reached the shore I met a man, of whom I enquired when
a boat would start for Hogansburg.He gazed at us a moment, and then
pointed to five boats out in the river, and said those were the last
to go that day.They were then ready to start, and waited only for the
tow-boat to take them along.But they were so far away we could not get
to them, even if we dared risk ourselves among so many passengers.To stay there over night, was not to be thought of for a
moment.We were sure to be taken, and carried back, if we ventured to
try it.Yet there was but one alternative; either remain there till the
next day, or try to get a passage on the tow-boat.It did not take me a
long time to decide for myself, and I told the nun that I should go on,
if the captain would take me!she exclaimed,
"There are no ladies on that boat, and I do not like to go with so
many men.""I am not afraid of the men," I replied, "if they are not
Romanists, and I am resolved to go.""Do not leave me," she cried, with
streaming tears."I am sure we can get along better if we keep together,
but I dare not go on the boat.""And I dare not stay here," said I,
and so we parted.I to pursue my solitary way, she to go, I know not
whither.I gave her the parting hand, and have never heard from her
since, but I hope she succeeded better than I did, in her efforts to
escape.I went directly to the captain of the boat and asked him if he could
carry me to the States.He said he should go as far as Ogdensburg, and
would carry me there, if I wished; or he could set me off at some place
where he stopped for wood and water.When I told him I had no money to
pay him, he smiled, and asked if I was a run-a-way.I frankly confessed
that I was, for I thought it was better for me to tell the truth than
to try to deceive."Well," said the captain, "I will not betray you; but
you had better go to my state-room and stay there."I thanked him, but
said I would rather stay where I was.He then gave me the key to his
room, and advised me to go in and lock the door, "for," said he, "we are
not accustomed to have ladies in this boat, and the men may annoy you.You will find it more pleasant and comfortable to stay there alone."Truly grateful for his kindness, and happy to escape from the gaze of
the men, I followed his direction; nor did I leave the room again until
I left the boat.The captain brought me my meals, but did not attempt to
enter the room.There was a small window with a spring on the inside; he
would come and tap on the window, and ask me to raise it, when he would
hand me a waiter on which he had placed a variety of refreshments, and
immediately retire.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.That night and the next day I suffered all the horrors of sea-sickness;
and those who have known by experience how completely it prostrates the
energies of mind and body, can imagine how I felt on leaving the boat at
night.The kind-hearted captain set me on shore at a place where he left
coal and lumber, a short distance from the village of Ogdensburg.He
gave me twelve and half cents, and expressed regret that he could do no
more for me.He said he could not direct me to a lodging for the night,
being a stranger in the place, and this the first time he had been on
that route.Should this narrative chance to meet his eye, let him know
that his kind and delicate attentions to a stranger in distress, are and
ever will be remembered with the gratitude they so richly merit.It
was with evident reluctance that he left me to make my way onward as I
could.And now, reader, imagine, if you can, my situation.A stranger in a
strange land, and comparatively a stranger to the whole world--alone in
the darkness of night, not knowing where to seek a shelter or a place
to lay my head; exhausted with sea-sickness until I felt more dead than
alive, it did seem as though it would be a luxury to lie down and die.My stockings and shoes were all worn out with so much walking, my feet
sore, swollen, and bleeding, and my limbs so stiff and lame that it was
only by the greatest effort that I could step at all.So extreme were my
sufferings, that I stopped more than once before I reached the village,
cast myself upon the cold ground, and thought I could go no further.Not even the idea of being run over in the darkness by some passing
traveller, had power to keep me on my feet.Then I would rest awhile,
and resolve to try again; and so I hobbled onward.It seemed an age of
misery before I came to any house; but at length my spirits revived
at the sight of brilliant lights through the windows, and the sound of
cheerful voices that fell upon my ear.And now I thought my troubles over for that night at least.But no, when
I asked permission to stay over night, it was coldly refused.Again
and again I called at houses where the people seemed to enjoy all the
comforts and even the luxuries of life; but their comforts were for
themselves and not for a toil-worn traveller like me.This I was made to
understand in no gentle manner; and some of those I called upon were not
very particular in the choice of language.By this time my feet were dreadfully swollen, and O!so sore and stiff,
that every step produced the most intense agony.Is it strange that I
felt as though life was hardly worth preserving?I resolved to call at
one house more, and if again refused, to lie down by the wayside and
die.I accordingly entered the village hotel and asked for the landlady.The bar-tender gave me a suspicious glance that made me tremble, and
asked my business.I told him my business was with the landlady and no
other person.He left the room a moment, and then conducted me to her
chamber.As I entered a lady came forward to meet me, and the pleasant expression
of her countenance at once won my confidence.She gave me a cordial
welcome, saying, with a smile, as she led me to a seat, "I guess, my
dear, you are a run-a-way, are you not?"I confessed that it was even
so; that I had fled from priestly cruelty, had travelled as far as I
could, and now, weary, sick, and faint from long fasting, I had ventured
to cast myself upon her mercy.I asked, "and are
you a Roman Catholic?""No," she replied, "I am not a Roman Catholic,
and I will protect you.You seem to have suffered much, and are quite
exhausted.I will not betray you, for
I dislike the priests and the convents as much as you do."She then called her little girl, and ordered a fire kindled in another
chamber, saying she did not wish her servants to see me.The child
soon returned, when the lady herself conducted me to a large, pleasant
bed-room, handsomely furnished with every convenience, and a fire in
the grate.She gave me a seat in a large easy-chair before the fire, and
went out, locking the door after her.In a short time she returned with
warm water for a bath, and with her own hands gave me all the assistance
needed.As I related the incidents of the day, she expressed much
sympathy for my sufferings, and said she was glad I had come to her.She gave, me a cordial, and then brought me a cup of tea and other
refreshments, of which I made a hearty supper.She would not allow me to
eat all I wished; but when I had taken as much as was good for me,
she bathed my feet with a healing wash, and assisted me to bed.O, the
luxury of that soft and comfortable bed!No one can realize with what a
keen sense of enjoyment I laid my head upon those downy pillows, unless
they have suffered as I did, and known by experience the sweetness of
repose after excessive toil.All that night this good lady sat beside my bed, and kept my feet wet in
order to reduce the swelling.I was little inclined to sleep, and at her
request related some of the events of my convent life.While doing this,
I hardly knew what to make of this curious woman.Sometimes she would
weep, and then she would swear like any pirate.I was surprised and
somewhat afraid of her, she seemed so strange and used such peculiar
language.She understood my feelings at once, and immediately said, "You
need not be afraid of me, for I have a kind heart, if I do use wicked
words.I cannot help swearing when I think about the priests, monsters
of iniquity that they are; what fearful crimes they do commit under the
cloak of religion!O, if the people of this land could but see their
real character, they would rise en masse and drive them from the
country, whose liberties they will, if possible, destroy.For myself I
have good cause to hate them.Shall I tell you my story, dear?"I begged
her to do so, which she did, as follows:

"I once had a sister, young, talented, beautiful, amiable and
affectionate.She was the pride of all our family, the idol of our
souls.She wished for an education, and we gladly granted her request.In our zeal to serve her, we resolved to give her the very best
advantages, and so we sent her to a Romish school.It was a seminary for
young ladies taught by nuns, and was the most popular one in that
part of the country.My father, like many other parents who knew such
establishments only by report, had not the least idea of its true
character.But deluded by the supposed sanctity of the place, he was
happy in the thought that he had left his darling where it was said that
'science and religion go hand in hand.'She wrote to us that she was pleased with the school, and wished to
remain.We thought her hand writing wonderfully improved, and eagerly
looked forward to the time when she would return to us a finished
scholar, as well as an accomplished lady.But those pleasant prospects
were soon overcast.Too soon, our happy, bounding hearts were hushed by
unspeakable grief, and our brilliant anticipations were dissipated in
the chamber of death.In their place came those solemn realities, the
shroud, the coffin, the hearse and the tomb.""Yes," replied the lady, as she wiped away the
fast flowing tears; "Yes, she died.I believe she was poisoned, but we
could do nothing; we had no proof."She had been long at school before we
suspected the deception that was practised upon us.But at length I went
with my other sister to see her, and the Superior informed us that she
was ill, and could not see us.We proposed going to her room, but to our
great surprise were assured that such a thing could not be allowed.We left with sad hearts, and soon called again.I cannot describe my
feelings when we were coldly informed that she did not wish to see us.Surely something must be wrong; and we left with
terrible presentiments of coming evil.Yes, too soon were our
worst fears realized.I called one day resolved to see her before I left
the house.Conceive, if you can, my surprise and horror, when they told
me that my beautiful, idolized sister had resolved to become a nun.That she had already renounced the world, and would hold no further
communication with her relatives."You know it now," was the cold reply.I did not believe a
word of it, and when I told my father what they said, he went to them,
and resolutely demanded his child.At first they refused to give her up,
but when they saw that his high spirit was aroused--that he would not be
flattered or deceived, they reluctantly yielded to his demand."LANDLADY'S STORY CONTINUED.The poor girl was overjoyed to meet her friends again, but how great was
our astonishment and indignation when she informed us that she had never
received a single line from home after she entered the school, nor did
she ever know that we had called to see her until we informed her of
the fact.Whenever she expressed surprise that she did not hear from us,
they told her that we had probably forgotten her, and strove to awaken
in her mind feelings of indignation, suspicion and animosity.Not
succeeding in this, however, they informed her that her father had
called, and expressed a wish that she should become a nun; that he did
not think it best for her to return home again, nor did he even ask for
a parting interview.Confounded and utterly heart-broken, she would have given herself up to
uncontrollable grief had she been allowed to indulge her feelings.But
even the luxury of tears was forbidden, and she was compelled to assume
an appearance of cheerfulness, and to smile when her heart-strings were
breaking.We brought forward the letters we had received from time to
time which we believed she had written.She had never seen them, before,
"and this," said she, "is not my hand-writing."Of this fact she soon
convinced us, but she said she had written letter after letter hoping
for an answer, but no answer came.She said she knew that the Superior
examined all the letters written by the young ladies, but supposed they
were always sent, after being read.But it was now plain to be seen that
those letters were destroyed, and others substituted in their place.[Footnote: Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, in his
"Narrative," published by the American and Foreign Christian Union,
relates a similar experience of his own, when in the Papal College of
San Bernardo.Being urged to sign "a deed of humility," in which he was to renounce
all his property and give it to the college, he says, "I knew not what
to think of this "deed of humility."A thousand misgivings filled my
mind, and hoping to receive from the notary an explanation that would
assist me in fully comprehending its intention, I anxiously said, "I
must request, sir, that you will inform me what is expected from me.Tell me what is this deed--whether it be really a mere form, as has been
represented to me, or if"--Here the master arose, and in an imperious
tone interrupted me, saying,--"Do not be obstinate and rebellions, but
obey.I have already told you that when you assume the habit of the
Order, the chapter 'de humititate' shall be explained to you.In this
paper you have only to make a renunciation of all you possess on earth."And if I renounce all, who, when I leave the college,
will provide for me?""That," said he, "is
the point to which I wish to call your attention, in advising you to
make some reservation.If you neglect to do so, you may find yourself in
difficulties, losing, as you irrevocably will, every right of your own."At these words, so palpable, so glaring, the bandage fell from my eyes,
and I saw the abyss these monsters were opening under my feet."This is
a deception, a horrible deception," I exclaimed."I now understand
the 'deed of humility,' but I protest I will not sign it, I will have
nothing more to do with it."* * * After spending two or three hours in
bitterness and woe, I resolved to have recourse to my family.For this
purpose I wrote a long letter to my mother, in which I exposed all the
miseries of my heart, related what had taken place with regard to the
"deed of humility," and begged of her consolation and advice.I gave
the letter into the hands of a servant, and on the following morning
received a reply, in which I was told, in gentle, terms, to
be tranquil,--not to resist the wishes of my directors,--sign
unhesitatingly any paper that might be required, for, when my studies
were completed, and I quitted the college, the validity of these forms
would cease.This letter set all my doubts at rest, and restored peace
to my mind.It was written by my mother, and she, I felt assured, would
never deceive me.How could I for one moment imagine that this epistle
was an invention of my enemies, who imitated the hand-writing and
affectionate style of my mother?Some persons will say, you might have
suspected it.* * * I reply, that in the uprightness of my heart,
I could not conceive such atrocious wickedness; it appeared utterly
irreconcilable with the sanctity of the place, and with the venerable
hoariness of persons dedicated to God.After perusing the letter, I hastened to the master, declaring my
readiness to sign the "deed of humility."He smiled approvingly on
finding how well his plan had succeeded.The notary and witnesses were
again summoned, and my condemnation written.The good notary, however,
pitying my situation, inserted an exceptional clause to the total
relinquishment of my rights.* * * No sooner was this business
concluded, than the master commanded me to write to my parents, to
inform them that I had signed the deed of renunciation, and was willing,
for the benefit of my soul, to assume the monkish habit.He was present
when I wrote this letter; I was, therefore, obliged to adopt the
phrases suggested by him,--phrases, breathing zeal and devotion; full of
indifference to the world, and tranquil satisfaction at the choice I
had made.My parents, thought I, will be astonished when they read this
epistle, but they must perceive that the language is not mine, so little
is it in accordance with my former style of writing.Reader, in the course of thirteen months, only one, of from fifty to
sixty letters which I addressed to my mother, was ever received by her,
and that one was this very letter.The monks, instead of forwarding
mine, had forged letters imitating the hand-writing, and adopting a
style suited to their purpose; and instead of consigning to me the
genuine replies, they artfully substituted answers of their own
fabrication.My family, therefore, were not surprised at the tenor of
this epistle, but rejoiced over it, and reputed me already a Saint.They
probably pictured me to themselves, on some future day, with a mitre on
my head--with the red cap--nay, perhaps, even wearing the triple crown.You knew not that your son,
in anguish and despair, was clashing his chains, and devouring his tears
in secret; that a triple bandage was placed before his eyes, and that
he was being dragged, an unwilling victim, to the sacrifice."Returning
home soon after, Ciocci rushed to his mother, and asked if she had
his letters.They, were produced; when he found that only one had been
written by him."It follows then," said my father, "that these letters are forgeries,
and the excuses they have so often made are base falsehoods.A teacher
of the religion of Jesus Christ guilty of lying and forgery!'O, my soul
come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly mine honor be thou
not united.'""But we have our darling home again," said I, "and now we shall keep her
with us."Never shall I forget the sweet, sad smile that came over her
pale face as I uttered these words.Perchance, even then she realized
that she was soon to leave us, never more to return.However this may
be, she gradually declined.Slowly, but surely she went down to the
grave.Every remedy was tried--every measure resorted to, that seemed
to promise relief, but all in vain.We had the best physicians, but they
frankly confessed that they did not understand her disease.In a very
few months after her return, we laid our lovely and beloved sister
beneath the clods of the valley.Our good old physician wept as he gazed
upon her cold remains.I believe he thought she was poisoned, but as he
could not prove it, he would only have injured himself by saying so.As
for myself, I always thought that she knew too many of their secrets to
be allowed to live after leaving them."And now, dear," she continued,
"do you think it strange that I hate the Romanists?Do you wonder if I
feel like swearing when I think of priests and convents?"Truly, I did not wonder that she hated them, though I could not
understand what benefit it could be to swear about it; but I did not
doubt the truth of her story.How often, in the convent from which I
fled, had I heard them exult over the success of some deep laid scheme
to entrap the ignorant, the innocent and the unwary!If a girl was rich
or handsome, as sure as she entered their school, so sure was she to
become a nun, unless she had influential friends to look after her and
resolutely prevent it.To effect this, no means were left untried.The
grossest hypocricy, and the meanest deception were practised to prevent
a girl from holding communication with any one out of the convent No
matter how lonely, or how homesick she might feel, she was not allowed
to see her friends, or even to be informed of their kind attentions.So
far from this, she was made to believe, if possible, that her relatives
had quite forsaken her, while these very relatives were boldly informed
that she did not wish to see them.If they wrote to their friends, as
they sometimes did, their letters were always destroyed, while those
received at home were invariably written by the priest or Superior.These remarks, however, refer only to those who are rich, or beautiful
in person.Many a girl can say with truth that she has attended
the convent school, and no effort was ever made--no inducement ever
presented to persuade her to become a nun.Consequently, she says that
stories like the above are mere falsehoods, reported to injure the
school.This may be true so far as she is concerned, but you may be sure
she has neither riches nor beauty, or if possessed of these, there was
some other strong reason why she should be an exception to the general
rule.Could she know the private history of some of her school-mates,
she would tell a different story.I remember that while in the convent, I was one day sent up stairs to
assist a Superior in a chamber remote from the kitchen, and in a part of
the house where I had never been before.Returning alone to the kitchen,
I passed a door that was partly open, and hearing a slight groan within,
I pushed open the door and looked in, before I thought what I was doing.A young girl lay upon a bed, who looked more like a corpse than a living
person.She saw me, and motioned to have me come to her.As I drew near the bed, she burst into tears, and whispered, "Can't you
get me a drink of cold water?"I told her I did not know, but I would
try.I hastened to the kitchen, and as no one was present but a nun whom
I did not fear, I procured a pitcher of water, and went back with it
without meeting any one on the way.I was well aware that if seen, I
should be punished, but I did not care.I was doing as I would wish
others to do to me, and truly, I had my reward.Never shall I forget how
grateful that poor sufferer was for a draught of cold water.She could
not tell how many days she had been fasting, for some of the time she
had been insensible; but it must have been several days, and she did not
know how long she was to remain in that condition.I asked, in a whisper; "and what have you done to
induce them to punish you so?""O," said she, with a burst of tears, and
grasping my hand with her pale, cold fingers, "I was in the school, and
I thought it would be so nice to be a nun!Then my father died and left
me all his property, and they persuaded me to stay here, and give it all
to the church.I was so sad then I did not care for money, and I had no
idea what a place it is.I really thought that the nuns were pure and
holy--that their lives were devoted to heaven, their efforts consecrated
to the cause of truth and righteousness.I thought that this was indeed
the 'house of God,' the very 'gate of heaven.'But as soon as they were
sure of me, they let me know--but you understand me; you know what I
mean?"I nodded assent, and once more asked, "What did you do?""O,
I was in the school," said she, "and I knew that a friend of mine was
coming here just as I did; and I could not bear to see her, in all her
loveliness and unsuspecting innocence, become a victim to these vile
priests.I found an opportunity to let her know what a hell she
was coming to.'Twas an unpardonable sin, you see.I had robbed the
church--committed sacrilege, they said--and they have almost killed me
for it.I wish they would QUITE, for I am sure death has no terrors for
me now.God will never punish me for what I have done.But go; don't
stay any longer; they'll kill you if they catch you here."I knew that
she had spoken truly--they WOULD kill me, almost, if not quite, if
they found me there; but I must know a little more.I asked, "or did you both have to suffer, to pay for your
generous act?"She did not come,
and she promised not to tell of me.I don't think she did; but they
managed to find it out, I don't know how; and now--O God, let me die!"I was obliged to go, and I left her, with a promise to carry her some
bread if I could.But I could not, and I never saw her again.Yet what
a history her few words unfolded!It was so much like the landlady's
story, I could not forbear relating it to her.She seemed much
interested in all my convent adventures; and in this way we spent the
night.Next morning the lady informed me that I could not remain with her in
safety, but she had a sister, who lived about half a mile distant, with
whom I could stop until my feet were sufficiently healed to enable me to
resume my journey.She then sent for her sister, who very kindly, as
I then thought, acceded to her request, and said I was welcome to stay
with her as long as I wished.Arrangements were therefore made at once
for my removal.My kind hostess brought two large buffalo robes into my
chamber, which she wrapped around my person in such a way as to shield
me from the observation of the servants.She then called one whom she
could trust, and bade him take up the bundle and carry it down to
a large covered wagon that stood at the door.I have often wondered
whether the man knew what was in that bundle or not.I do not think
he did, for he threw me across his shoulder as he would any bale of
merchandise, and laid me on the bottom of the carriage.The two ladies
then entered, laughing heartily at the success of their ruse, and joking
me about my novel mode of conveyance.In this manner we were driven
to the sister's residence, and I was carried into the house by the
servants, in the same way.The landlady stopped for a few moments, and
when she left she gave me cloth for a new dress, a few other articles of
clothing, and three dollars in money.She bade me stay there and make my
dress, and on no account venture out again in my nun dress.She wished
me success in my efforts to escape, commended me to the care of our
heavenly Father, and bade me farewell.She returned in the wagon alone,
and left me to make the acquaintance of my new hostess.This lady was a very different woman from her sister, and I soon had
reason to regret that I was in her power.It has been suggested to me
that the two ladies acted in concert; that I was removed for the sole
purpose of being betrayed into the hands of my enemies.But I am not
willing to believe this.Dark as human nature appears to me--accustomed
as I am to regard almost every one with suspicion--still I cannot for
one moment cherish a thought so injurious to one who was so kind to me.Is it possible that she could be such a hypocrite?Treat me with so much
tenderness, and I might say affection, and then give me up to what was
worse than death?No; whatever the reader may think about it, I can
never believe her guilty of such perfidy.I regret exceedingly my
inability to give the name of this lady in connection with the history
of her good deeds, but I did not learn the name of either sister.The
one to whom I was now indebted for a shelter seemed altogether careless
of my interests.I had been with her but a few hours when she asked me
to do some washing for her.Of course I was glad to do it; but when she
requested me to go into the yard and hang the clothes upon the line, I
became somewhat alarmed.I did not like to do it, and told her so; but
she laughed at my fears, overruled all my objections, said no one in
that place would seek to harm or to betray me, and assured me there
was not the least danger.I at last consented to go, though my reason,
judgment, and inclination, had I followed their dictates, would have
kept me in the house.But I did not like to appear ungrateful, or
unwilling to repay the kindness I received, as far as I was able; still
I could not help feeling that it was an ungenerous demand.She might at
least have offered me a bonnet or a shawl, as a partial disguise; but
she did nothing of the kind.When I saw that I could not avoid the exposure I resolved to make
the best of it and get through as quickly, as possible; but my dress
attracted a good deal of attention, and I saw more than one suspicious
glance directed towards me before my task was finished.When it was
over I thought no more about it, but gave myself up to the bright
anticipations of future happiness, which now began to take possession of
my mind.That night I retired to a comfortable bed, and was soon lost to all
earthly cares in the glorious land of dreams.What unalloyed happiness I
enjoyed that night!Truly, the vision
was bright, but a sad awaking followed.Some time in the night I was
aroused by the flashing of a bright light from a dark lantern suddenly
opened.I attempted to rise, but before I could realize where I was,
a strong hand seized me and a gag was thrust into my mouth.The man
attempted to take me in his arms, but with my hands and feet I
defended myself to the best of my ability.Another man now came to his
assistance, and with strong cords confined my hands and feet, so that I
was entirely at their mercy.Perfectly helpless, I could neither resist
nor call for help.They then took me up and carried me down stairs, with
no clothing but my night-dress, not even a shawl to shield me from the
cold night air.At the gate stood a long covered wagon, in form like a butchers cart,
drawn by two horses, and beside it a long box with several men standing
around it.I had only time to observe this, when they thrust me into the
box, closed the lid, placed it in the wagon, and drove rapidly away.I could not doubt for a moment into whose hands I had fallen, and when
they put me into the box, I wished I might suffocate, and thus end my
misery at once.But they had taken good care to prevent this by boring
holes in the box, which admitted air enough to keep up respiration.And this was the result of all my efforts for freedom!After all I had
suffered in making my escape, it was a terrible disappointment to be
thus cruelly betrayed, gagged, bound, and boxed up like an article of
merchandise, carried back to certain torture, and perchance to death.O, blame me not, gentle reader, if in my haste, and the bitter
disappointment and anguish of my spirit, I questioned the justice of the
power that rules the world.Nor let your virtuous indignation wax hot
against me if I confess to you, that I even doubted the existence of
that power.How often had I cried to God for help!Why were my prayers
and tears disregarded?What had I done to deserve such a fife of misery?These, and similar thoughts occupied my mind during that lonely midnight
ride.Regis before the first Mass in the morning.The box
was then taken into the chapel, where they took me out and carried me
into the church.I was seated at the foot of the altar, with my hands
and feet fast bound, the gag still in my mouth, and no clothing on, but
my night-dress.Two men stood beside me, and I remained here until the
priest had said mass and the people retired from the church.He then
came down from the altar, and said to the men beside me, "Well, you have
got her.""Yes Sir," they replied, "what shall we do with her?""Put her
on the five o'clock boat," said he, "and let the other men go with her
to Montreal.I want you to stay here, and be ready to go the other way
tonight" This priest was an Indian, but he spoke the English language
correctly and fluently.He seemed to feel some pity for my forlorn
condition, and as they were about to carry me away he brought a large
shawl, and wrapped it around me, for which I was truly grateful.At the appointed time, I was taken on board the boat, watched very
closely by the two men who had me in charge.There was need enough of
this, for I would very gladly have thrown myself into the water, had I
not been prevented.Once and again I attempted it, but the men held me
back.For this, I am now thankful, but at that time my life appeared of
so little importance, and the punishments I knew were in reserve for me
seemed so fearful, I voluntarily chose "strangling and death rather than
life."The captain and sailors were all Romanists, and seemed to vie
with each other in making me as unhappy as possible They made sport of
my "new fashioned clothing," and asked if I "did not wish to run away
again?"When they found I did not notice them they used the most abusive
and scurrilous language, mingled with vulgar and profane expressions,
which may not be repeated.The men who had charge of me, and who should
have protected me from such abuse, so far from doing it, joined in the
laugh, and appeared to think it a pleasant amusement to ridicule and vex
a poor helpless fugitive.May God forgive them for their cruelty, and
in the hour of their greatest need, may they meet with the kindness they
refused to me.At Lachine we changed boats and took another to Montreal.When we
arrived there, three priests were waiting for us.Their names I
perfectly remember, but I am not sure that I can spell them correctly.Having never learned while in the nunnery, to read, or spell anything
except a simple prayer, it is not strange if I do make mistakes, when
attempting to give names from memory.I can only give them as they were
pronounced.They were called Father Kelly, Dow, and Conroy.All the
priests were called father, of whatever age they might be.As we proceeded from the boat to the Nunnery, one of the priests went
before us while the others walked beside me, leading me between them.People gazed at us as we passed, but they did not dare to insult, or
laugh at me, while in such respectable company.Yet, methinks it
must have been a ludicrous sight to witness so much parade for a poor
run-a-way nun.On our arrival at the Nunnery, I was left alone for half an hour.Then
the Bishop came in with the Lady Superior, and the Abbess who had charge
of the kitchen when I left.The Bishop read to me three punishments of
which he said, I could take my choice.First.--To fast five days in the
fasting room.Second.--To suffer punishment in the lime room.Third.--To
fast four days, in the cell.As I knew nothing of these places except
the cell, a priest was directed to take me to them, that I might see for
myself, and then take my choice.At first, I thought I did not care, and
I said I had no choice about it; but when I came to see the rooms, I was
thankful that I was not allowed to abide by that decision.Certainly, I
had no idea what was before me.I was blindfolded, and taken to the lime room first.I think it must
have been situated at a great distance from the room we left, for he led
me down several flights of stairs, and through long, low passages, where
it was impossible to stand erect.At length we entered a room where the
atmosphere seemed laden with hot vapor.My blinder was removed, and I
found myself in a pleasant room some fifteen feet square.There was no
furniture of any kind, but a wide bench, fastened to the wall, extended
round three sides of the room.The floor looked like one solid block of
dark  marble; not a crack or seam to be seen in it, but it was
clouded, highly polished, and very beautiful.Around the sides of the
room, a great number of hooks and chains were fastened to the wall, and
a large hook hung in the center overhead.Near the door stood two men,
with long iron bars, some two inches square, on their shoulders.The priest directed me to stand upon the bench, and turning to the men,
he bade them raise the door.They put down their bars, and I suppose
touched a concealed spring, for the whole floor at once flew up, and
fastened to the large hook over head.Surprised and terrified, I stood
wondering what was to come next.At my feet yawned a deep pit, from
which, arose a suffocating vapor, so hot, it almost scorched my face and
nearly stopped my breath.The priest pointed to the heaving, tumbling
billows of smoke that were rolling below, and; asked, "How would you
like to be thrown into the lime?""Not at all," I gasped, in a voice
scarcely audible, "it would burn me to death."I suppose he thought I
was sufficiently frightened, for he bade his men close the door.This
they did by slowly letting down the floor, and I could see that it was
in some way supported by the chains attached to the walls but in what
manner I do not know.I was nearly suffocated by the lime smoke that filled the room, and
though I knew not what was in reserve for me, I was glad when my blinder
was put on, and I was led away.I think we returned the same way we
came, and entered another room where the scent was so very offensive,
that I begged to be taken out immediately.Even before my eyes were
uncovered, and I knew nothing of the loathsome objects by which we were
surrounded, I felt that I could not endure to breathe an atmosphere so
deadly.But the sight that met my eyes when my blinder was removed, I
cannot describe, nor the sensations with which I gazed upon it.I can
only give the reader some faint idea of the place, which, they said, was
called the fasting room, and here incorrigible offenders fasted until
they starved to death.Their dead bodies were not even
allowed a decent burial, but were suffered to remain in the place where
they died, until the work of death was complete and dust returned to
dust.Thus the atmosphere became a deadly poison to the next poor victim
who was left to breathe the noxious effluvia of corruption and decay.I
am well aware that my reader will hardly credit my statements, but I do
solemnly affirm that I relate nothing but the truth.In this room were
placed several large iron kettles, so deep that a person could sit in
them, and many of them contained the remains of human beings.In one the
corpse looked as though it had been dead but a short time.Others still
sat erect in the kettle, but the flesh was dropping from the bones.Every stage of decay was here represented, from the commencement, till
nothing but a pile of bones was left of the poor sufferer.Conceive, if you can, with what feelings I gazed upon these disgusting
relics of the dead.Even now, my blood chills in my veins, as memory
recalls the fearful sight, or as, in sleep, I live over again the
dread realities of that hour.I might,
perchance, escape it for that time, but what assurance had I that I was
not ultimately destined to such an end?These thoughts filled my mind,
as I followed the priest from the room; and for a long time I continued
to speculate upon what I had seen.They called it the fasting room; but
if fasting were the only object, why were they placed in those kettles,
instead of being allowed to sit on chairs or benches, or even on the
floor?And why placed in IRON kettles?It would have answered the purpose quite as well, if fasting
or starvation were the only objects in view.Then came the fearful
suggestion, were these kettles ever heated?And was that floor made
of stone or iron?The thought was too shocking to be cherished for a
moment; but I could not drive it from my mind.I was again blindfolded, and taken to a place they called a cell.But it
was quite different from the one I was in before.We descended several
steps as we entered it, and instead of the darkness I anticipated, I
found myself in a large room with sufficient light to enable me to see
every object distinctly.One end of a long chain was fastened around my
waist, and the other firmly secured to an iron ring in the floor; but
the chain, though large and heavy, was long enough to allow me to go all
over the room.I could not see how it was lighted, but it must have been
in some artificial manner, for it was quite as light at night, as in the
day.Here were instruments of various kinds, the use of which, I did
not understand; some of them lying on the floor, others attached to the
sides of the room.One of them was made in the form of a large fish,
but of what material I do not know.It was of a bright flesh color, and
fastened to a board on the floor.If I pressed my foot upon the board,
it would put in motion some machinery within, which caused it to spring
forward with a harsh, jarring sound like the rumbling of the cars.At
the same time its eyes would roll round, and its mouth open, displaying
a set of teeth so large and long that I was glad to keep at a safe
distance.I wished to know whether it would really bite me or not, but
it looked so frightful I did not dare to hazard the experiment.Another so nearly resembled a large serpent, I almost thought it was
one; but I found it moved only when touched in a certain manner.Then
it would roll over, open its mouth, and run out its tongue.There was
another that I cannot describe, for I never saw anything that looked
like it.It was some kind of a machine, and the turning of a crank made
it draw together in such a way, that if a person were once within its
embrace, the pressure would soon arrest the vital current, and stop
the breath of life.Around the walls of the room were chains, rings and
hooks, almost innumerable; but I did not know their use, and feared
to touch them.I believed them all to be instruments of torture, and I
thought they gave me a long chain in the hope and expectation that
my curiosity would lead me into some of the numerous traps the room
contained.Every morning the figure I had seen beside the dying nun, which they
called the devil, came to my cell, and unlocking the door himself,
entered, and walked around me, laughing heartily, and seeming much
pleased to find me there.He would blow white froth from his mouth, but
he never spoke to me, and when he went out, he locked the door after him
and took away the key.He was, in fact, very thoughtful and prudent, but
it will be long before I believe that he came as they pretended, from
the spirit world.So far from being frightened, the incident was rather
a source of amusement.Such questions as the following would force
themselves upon my mind.If that image is really the devil, where did he
get that key?Does the devil hold the keys
of this nunnery, so that he can come and go as he pleases?Or, are the
priests on such friendly terms with his satanic majesty that they lend
him their keys?Gentlemen of the Grey
Nunnery, please tell us how it is about those keys.One day a woman came into my cell, dressed in white, a white cap on
her head, and so very pale she looked more like a corpse than a living
person.She came up to me with her mouth wide open, and stood gazing
at me for a moment in perfect silence.She then asked, "Where have you
been?""Very
well," said I. She paused a moment, and then asked, "Did you find your
friends?""No, ma'am," said I, "I did not."Another pause, and then she
said, "Perhaps you will if you go again.""No," I replied, "I shall not
try again.""You had better try it once more," she added, and I thought
there was a slight sneer in her tone; "Perhaps you may succeed better
another time.""No," I replied, "I shall not try to run away from the
nunnery again.I should most assuredly be caught and brought back, and
then they would make me suffer so much, I assure you I shall never do it
again."She looked at me a moment as though she would read my very soul,
and said, "And so you did not find your friends, after all, did you?"I
again told her that I did not, and she seemed satisfied with the result
of her questioning.When she came in, I was pleased to see her, and
thought I would ask her for something to eat, or at least for a little
cold water.But she seemed so cold-hearted, so entirely destitute of
sympathy or kind feeling, I had no courage to speak to her, for I felt
that it would do no good.I knew from her looks
that she must have been a great sufferer; but I have heard it said that
extreme suffering sometimes hardens instead of softening the heart,
and I believe it.It seemed to me that this woman had suffered so much
herself, that every kind feeling was crushed out of her soul.I was glad
when she left me, locking the door after her.Four days they kept me in this cell, and for five days and nights I had
not tasted food or drink.I endured the most intolerable agonies from
hunger and thirst.The suffering produced by hunger, when it becomes
actual starvation, is far beyond anything that I can imagine.There
is no other sensation that can be compared to it, and no language can
describe it.One must feel it in order to realize what it is.The
first two days I amused myself by walking round my room and trying to
conjecture the use to which the various instruments were applied.Then
I became so weak I could only think of eating and drinking.I sometimes
fell asleep, but only to dream of loaded tables and luxurious feasts.Yet I could never taste the luxuries thus presented.Whenever I
attempted to do so, they would be snatched away, or I would wake to
find it all a dream.Driven to a perfect frenzy by the intensity of my
sufferings, I would gladly have eaten my own flesh.Well was it for me
that no sharp instrument was at hand, for as a last resort I more than
once attempted to tear open my veins with my teeth.This severe paroxysm passed away, and I sank into a state of partial
unconsciousness, in which I remained until I was taken out of the cell.I do not believe I should have lived many hours longer, nor should I
ever have been conscious of much more suffering.With me the "bitterness
of death had passed," and I felt disappointed and almost angry to be
recalled to a life of misery.It was
the only boon I craved.But this would have been too merciful; moreover,
they did not care to lose my services in the kitchen.I was a good
drudge for them, and they wished to restore me on the same principle
that a farmer would preserve the life of a valuable horse.The first thing I realized they were
placing me in a chair in the kitchen, and allowed me to lean my head
upon the table.They gave me some gruel, and I soon revived so that I
could sit up in my chair and speak in a whisper.But it was some hours
before I could stand on my feet or speak loud.An Abbess was in the
kitchen preparing bread and wine for the priests (they partake of
these refreshments every day at ten in the morning and three in the
afternoon).She brought a pailful of wine and placed it on the table
near me, and left a glass standing beside it.When she turned away, I
took the glass, dipped up a little of the wine, and drank it.She saw
me do it, but said not a word, and I think she left it there for that
purpose.The wine was very strong, and my stomach so weak, I soon began
to feel sick, and asked permission to go to bed.They took me up in
their arms and carried me to my old room and laid me on the bed.Here
they left me, but the Abbess soon returned with some gruel made very
palatable with milk and sugar.I was weak, and my hand trembled so that
I could not feed myself; but the Abbess kindly sat beside me and fed me
until I was satisfied.I had nothing more to eat until the next day at
eleven o'clock, when the Abbess again brought me some bread and gruel,
and a cup of strong tea.She requested me to drink the tea as quick as
possible, and then she concealed the mug in which she brought it.I was now able to feed myself, and you may be sure I had an excellent
appetite, and was not half so particular about my food as some persons
I have since known.I lay in bed till near night, when I rose, dressed
myself without assistance, and went down to the kitchen.I was so weak
and trembled so that I could hardly manage to get down stairs; but
I succeeded at last, for a strong will is a wonderful incentive to
efficient action.She saw how weak I was, and as
she assisted me to a chair, she said, "I should not have supposed that
you could get down here alone.Have you had anything to eat to-day?"I
was about to say yes, but one of the nuns shook her head at me, and I
replied "No."She then brought some bread and wine, requesting me to eat
it quick, for fear some of the priests might come in and detect us.Thus
I saw that she feared the priests as well as the rest of us.Truly,
it was a terrible crime she had committed!No wonder she was afraid
of being caught!Giving a poor starved nun a piece of bread, and then
obliged to conceal it as she would have done a larceny or a murder!Think of it, reader, and conceive, if you can, the state of that
community where humanity is a crime--where mercy is considered a
weakness of which one should be ashamed!If a pirate or a highwayman had
been guilty of treating a captive as cruelly as I was treated by those
priests, he would have been looked upon as an inhuman monster, and at
once given up to the strong grasp of the law.But when it is done by a
priest, under the cloak of Religion, and within the sacred precincts of
a nunnery, people cry out, when the tale is told, "Impossible!""What
motive could they have had?"But whether
the statement is believed or otherwise, it is a fact that in the Grey
Nunnery at Montreal the least exhibition of a humane spirit was
punished as a crime.The nun who was found guilty of showing mercy to a
fellow-sufferer was sure to find none herself.From this time I gained very fast, for the Abbess saw how hungry I was,
and she would either put food in my way, or give me privately what I
wished to eat.In two weeks I was able to go to work in the kitchen
again.But those I had formerly seen there were gone.I never knew what
became of the sick nun, nor could I learn anything about the one who ran
away with me.I thought that the men who brought me to St.Regis, were
kept there to go after her, but I do not know whether they found her
or not.For myself, I promised so solemnly, and with such apparent
sincerity, that I would never leave the nunnery again, I was believed
and trusted.Had I been kindly treated, had my life been even tolerable,
my conscience would have reproached me for deceiving them, but as it
was, I felt that I was more "sinned against, than sinning."I could not
think it wrong to get away, if the opportunity presented, and for this I
was constantly on the watch.Every night I lay awake long after all
the rest were buried in slumber, trying to devise some plan, by which
I could once more regain my liberty.Having
just tasted the sweets of freedom, how could I be content to remain in
servitude all my life?Many a time have I left my bed at night, resolved
to try to escape once more, but the fear of detection would deter me
from the attempt.In the discharge of my daily duties, I strove to the utmost of my
ability to please my employers.I so far succeeded, that for five weeks
after my return I escaped punishment.Then, I made a slight mistake
about my work, though I verily thought I was doing it according to the
direction.For this, I was told that I must go without two meals, and
spend three days in the torture room.I supposed it was the same room I
was in before, but I was mistaken.I was taken into the kitchen cellar,
and down a flight of stairs to another room directly under it.From
thence, a door opened into another subterranean apartment which they
called the torture room.These doors were so constructed, that a casual
observer would not be likely to notice them.I had been in that cellar
many times, but never saw that door until I was taken through it.A
person might live in the nunnery a life-time, and never see or hear
anything of such a place.I presume those visitors who call at the
school-rooms, go over a part of the house, and leave with the impression
that the convent is a nice place, will never believe my statements about
this room.It is exceedingly
difficult for pure minds to conceive how any human being can be so
fearfully depraved.Knowing the purity of their own intentions, and
judging others by themselves, it is not strange that they regard such
tales of guilt and terror as mere fabrications, put forth to gratify the
curiosity of the wonder-loving crowd.I remember hearing a gentleman at the depot remark that the very
enormity of the crimes committed by the Romanists, is their best
protection."For," said he, "some of their practices are so shockingly
infamous they may not even be alluded to in the presence of the refined
and the virtuous.And if the story of their guilt were told, who would
believe the tale?Far easier would it be to call the whole a slanderous
fabrication, than to believe that man can be so vile."This consideration led me to doubt the propriety of attempting a
description of what I saw in that room.But I have engaged to give a
faithful narrative of what transpired in the nunnery; and shall I leave
out a part because it is so strange and monstrous, that people will not
believe it?I will tell, without the least exaggeration what I saw,
heard, and experienced.People may not credit the story now, but a day
will surely come when they will know that I speak the truth.As I entered the room I was exceedingly shocked at the horrid spectacle
that met my eye.I knew that fearful scenes were enacted in the
subterranean cells, but I never imagined anything half so terrible as
this.In various parts of the room I saw machines, and instruments of
torture, and on some of them persons were confined who seemed to be
suffering the most excruciating agony.I paused, utterly overcome with
terror, and for a moment imagined that I was a witness to the torments,
which, the priests say, are endured by the lost, in the world of woe.Was I to undergo such tortures, and which of those infernal engines
would be applied to me?The priest took hold of
me and put me into a machine that held me fast, while my feet rested
on a piece of iron which was gradually heated until both feet were
blistered.I think I must have been there fifteen minutes, but perhaps
the time seemed longer than it was.He then took me out, put some
ointment on my feet and left me.I was now at liberty to examine more minutely the strange objects around
me.There were some persons in the place whose punishment, like my own,
was light compared with others.But near me lay one old lady extended
on a rack.Her joints were all dislocated, and she was emaciated to the
last degree.I do not suppose I can describe this rack, for I never saw
anything like it.It looked like a gridiron but was long enough for the
tallest man to lie upon.There were large rollers at each end, to which
belts were attached, with a large lever to drive them back and forth.Upon this rack the poor woman was fastened in such a way, that when the
levers were turned and the rollers made to revolve, every bone in her
body was displaced.Then the violent strain would be relaxed, a little,
and she was so very poor, her skin would sink into the joints and remain
there till it mortified and corrupted.It was enough to melt the hardest heart to witness her agony; but
she bore it with a degree of fortitude and patience, I could not have
supposed possible, had I not been compelled to behold it.When I entered
the room she looked up and said, "Have you come to release me, or only
to suffer with me?"I did not dare to reply, for the priest was there,
but when he left us she exclaimed, "My child, let nothing induce you
to believe this cursed religion.It will be the death of you, and that
death, will be the death of a dog."I suppose she meant that they would
kill me as they would a dog.She then asked, "Who put you here?""He must have been a brute," said she, "or he never
could have done it."At one time I happened to mention the name of
God, when she fiercely exclaimed with gestures of contempt, "A God!You
believe there is one, do you?Don't you suffer yourself to believe any
such thing.Think you that a wise, merciful, and all powerful being
would allow such a hell as this to exist?Would he suffer me to be torn
from friends and home, from my poor children and all that my soul holds
dear, to be confined in this den of iniquity, and tortured to death in
this cruel manner?He would at once destroy these monsters
in human form; he would not suffer them, for one moment, to breathe the
pure air of heaven."At another time she exclaimed, "O, my children!Thus, at one moment, she would say there was no God, and the next,
pray to him for help.This did not surprise me, for she was in such
intolerable misery she did not realize what she did say.Every few hours
the priest came in, and gave the rollers a turn, when her joints would
crack and--but I cannot describe it.The sight made me sick and faint at
the time, as the recollection of it, does now.It seemed as though that
man must have had a heart of adamant, or he could not have done it.She would shriek, and groan, and weep, but it did not affect him in the
least.He was as calm, and deliberate as though he had a block of wood
in his hands, instead of a human being.When I saw him coming, I once
shook my head at her, to have her stop speaking; but when he was gone,
she said, "Don't shake your head at me; I do not fear him.He can but
kill me, and the quicker he does it the better.I would be glad if he
would put an end to my misery at once, but that would be too merciful.He is determined to kill me by inches, and it makes no difference what I
say to him."She had no food, or drink, during the three days I was there, and the
priest never spoke to her.He brought me my bread and water regularly,
and I would gladly have given it to that poor woman if she would have
taken it.It would only prolong
her sufferings, and she wished to die.I do not suppose she could have
lived, had she been taken out when I first saw her.In another part of the room, a monk was under punishment.He was
standing in some kind of a machine, with heavy weights attached to his
feet, and a belt passed across his breast under his arms.He appeared to
be in great distress, and no refreshment was furnished him while I was
there.On one side of the room, I observed a closet with a "slide door," as the
nuns called them.There were several doors of this description in the
building, so constructed as to slide back into the ceiling out of
sight.Through this opening I could see an image resembling a monk; and
whenever any one was put in there, they would shriek, and groan, and beg
to be taken out, but I could not ascertain the cause of their suffering.One day a nun was brought in to be punished.The priest led her up to
the side of the room, and bade her put her fingers into some holes in
the wall just large enough to admit them.She obeyed but immediately
drew them back with a loud shriek.I looked to see what was the matter
with her, and lo!every nail was torn from her fingers, which were
bleeding profusely.How it was done, I do not know.Certainly, there was
no visible cause for such a surprising effect.In all probability the
fingers came in contact with the spring of some machine on the other
side, or within the wall to which some sharp instrument was attached.I
would give much to know just how it was constructed, and what the
girl had done to subject herself to such a terrible and unheard-of
punishment.But this, like many other things in that establishment, was
wrapped in impenetrable mystery.God only knows when the veil will be
removed, or whether it ever will be until the day when all secret things
will be brought to light.When the three days expired, I was taken out of this room, but did not
go to work again till my feet were healed.I was then obliged to assist
in milking the cows, and taking care of the milk.They had a large
number of cows, I believe thirty-five, and dairy rooms, with every thing
convenient for making butter and cheese.When first directed to go
out and milk, I was pleased with the idea, for I hoped to find and
opportunity to escape; but I was again disappointed.In the cow yard, as
elsewhere, every precaution was taken to prevent it.Passing out of the main yard of the convent through a small door, I
found myself in a small, neat yard, surrounded by a high fence, so that
nothing could be seen but the sky overhead.The cows were driven in,
and the door immediately locked, so that escape from that place seemed
impossible.At harvest time, in company with twenty other nuns, I was taken out
into the country to the residence of the monks.The ride out there was
a great treat, and very much enjoyed by us all.I believe it was about
five miles, through a part of the city of Montreal; the north part
I think, but I am not sure.We stopped before a large white stone
building, situated in the midst of a large yard like the one at the
nunnery.A beautiful walk paved with stone, led from the gate to the
front door, and from thence, around the house.Within the yard, there
was also a delightful garden, with neat, well kept walks laid out in
various directions.Before the front door there stood a large cross.I think I never saw a more charming place; it appeared to me a perfect
paradise.I heard one of the priests say that the farm consisted of four
hundred acres, and belonged to the nunnery.The house was kept by two
widow ladies who were married before they embraced the Romish faith.They were the only women on the place previous to our arrival, and I
think they must have found it very laborious work to wait upon so many
monks.I do not know their number, but there was a great many of them,
besides a large family of boys, who, I suppose, were being educated for
priests or monks.Immediately on our arrival a part of our number were set to work in the
fields, while the rest were kept in the house to assist the women.I
hoped that I might be one of these last, but disappointment was again
my lot.I was sent to the field with the others, and set to reaping; a
priest being stationed near, to guard us and oversee our work.We were
watched very closely, one priest having charge of two nuns, for whose
safe keeping he was responsible.Here we labored until the harvest was
all gathered in.I dug potatoes, cut up corn and husked it, gathered
apples, and did all kinds of work that is usually done by men in the
fall of the year.Yet I was never allowed to wear a bonnet on my head,
or anything to shield me from the piercing rays of the sun.Some
days the heat was almost intolerable, and my cap was not the least
protection, but they allowed me no other covering.In consequence of this exposure, my head soon became the seat of severe
neuralgic pain, which caused me at times to linger over my work.My movements were immediately quickened, for the
work must be done notwithstanding the severe pain.Every command must be
obeyed whatever the result.At night a part of our number were taken to the nunnery, and the rest
of us locked up in our rooms in the house.We were not permitted to
take our meals with the two housekeepers, but a table was set for us in
another room.One would think that when gathering the fruit we would
be allowed to partake of it, or at least to taste it.But this was not
allowed; and as a priest's eye was ever upon us, we dare not disobey,
however much we might wish to do so.I used to wonder if the two women
who kept the house were as severely dealt with as we were, but had no
means whereby to satisfy my curiosity.They were not allowed to converse
with us, and we might not speak to them, or even look them in the face.Here, as at the nunnery, we were obliged to walk with the head bent
forward a little, the eyes fixed on the floor, one hand, if disengaged,
under the cape, the other down by the side, and on no occasion might we
look a person in the face.The two women seemed to be governed by the
same rules that we were, and subject to the same masters.I used to
think a great deal about them, and longed to know their history.They
wore blue dresses, with white caps, and white handkerchiefs on their
necks.Their life, I think, was a hard one.While we remained at this place I was not punished in any of the usual
methods.Perhaps they thought the exposure to a burning sun, and a
severe headache, sufficient to keep me in subjection without any other
infliction.But immediately on my return to the nunnery I was again
subjected to the same cruel, capricious, and unreasonable punishment.On the first day after my return one of the priests came into the
kitchen where I was at work, and I hastened to give him the usual
respectful salutation, which I have before described.But he took hold
of my arm and said, "What do you look so cross for?"And without giving
me time to reply, even if I had dared to do so, he added, "I'll teach
you not to look cross at me."He left the room, with an expression of
countenance that frightened me.I was not aware of looking cross at him,
though I must confess I had suffered so much at his hands already, I did
not feel very happy in his presence; yet I always endeavored to treat
him with all due respect.Certainly his accusation against me in this
instance was as false as it was cruel.I was only
a nun, and who would care if I was punished unjustly?The priest soon
returned with a band of leather, or something of the kind, into which
thorns were fastened in such numbers that the inside was completely
covered with them.This he fastened around my head with the points of
the thorns pressing into the skin, and drew it so tight that the blood
ran in streams over my neck and shoulders.I wore this band, or "crown
of thorns;" as they called it, for six hours, and all the time continued
my work as usual.Then I thought of the "crown of thorns" our Saviour
wore when he gave his life a ransom for the sins of the world.I thought
I could realize something of his personal agony, and the prayer of my
soul went up to heaven for grace to follow his example and forgive my
tormentors.From this time I was punished every day while I remained there, and
for the most simple things.It was evident they wished to break down my
spirit, but it only confirmed me in my resolution to get away from them
as soon as possible.One day I chanced to close the door a little too hard.It was mere
accident, but for doing it they burned me with red hot tongs.They kept
them in the fire till they were red hot, then plunged them into cold
water, drew them out as quickly as possible, and immediately applied
them to my arms or feet.The skin would, of course adhere to the iron,
and it would sometime burn down to the bone before they condescended to
remove it.At another time I was cruelly burned on my arms and shoulders
for not standing erect.The flesh was deep in some places, and the agony
I suffered was intolerable.I thought of the stories the Abbess used to
tell me years before about the martyrs who were burned at the stake.But
I had not a martyr's faith, and I could not imitate their patience and
resignation.The sores made on these occasions were long in healing,
and to this day I bear upon my person the scars caused by these frequent
burnings.I was often punished because I forgot to walk on my toes.For this
trivial offence I have often been made to fast two days.We all wore
cloth shoes, and it was the rule of the house that we should all walk on
tip-toe.Sometimes we would forget, and take a step or two in the usual
way; and then it did seem as though they rejoiced in the opportunity to
inflict punishment.It was the only amusement they had, and there was so
little variety in their daily life, I believe they were glad of anything
to break in upon the monotony of convent life, and give them a little
excitement.It was very hard for me to learn to walk on my toes, and
as I often failed to do it, I was of course punished for the atrocious
crime.But I did learn at last, for what can we not accomplish by
resolute perseverance?Several years of practice so confirmed the habit
that I found it as difficult to leave off as it was to begin.Even now I
often find myself tripping along on tip-toe before I am aware of it.We had a very cruel abbess in the kitchen, and this was one reason of
our being punished so often.She was young and inexperienced, and had
just been promoted to office, with which she seemed much pleased and
elated.She embraced every opportunity to exercise her authority, and
often have I fasted two whole days for accidentally spilling a little
water on the kitchen floor.Whenever she wished to call my attention to
her, she did not content herself with simply speaking, but would box my
ears, pull my hair, pinch my arms, and in many ways so annoy and provoke
me that I often wished her dead.One day when I was cleaning knives and
forks she came up to me and gave me such a severe pinch on my arm that
I carried the marks for many days.I did not wait to think what I was
doing, but turned and struck her with all my might.It could not have
been a light blow, for I was very angry.She turned away, saying she
should report me to the Lady Superior.I did not answer her, but as she
passed through the door I threw a knife which I hoped would hit her, but
it struck the door as she closed it.I expected something dreadful would
be done to me after this wilful violation of a well known law.But I
could bear it, I thought, and I was glad I hit her so hard.She soon returned with a young priest, who had been there but a short
time, and his heart had not yet become so hard as is necessary to be
a good Romish priest.He came to me and asked, "What is the matter?"I told him the Abbess punished me every day, that in fact I was under
punishment most of the time; that I did not deserve it, and I was
resolved to bear it no longer.I struck her because she pinched me for
no good reason; and I should in future try to defend myself from her
cruelty."Do you know," said he, "what will be done to you for this?""No, sir,"
said I, "I do not know," and I was about to add, "I do not care," but
I restrained myself.He went out, and for a long time I expected to be
called to account, but I heard no more of it.The Abbess, however, went
on in the old way, tormenting me on every occasion.One day the priests had a quarrel among themselves, and if I had said a
DRUNKEN QUARREL, I do not think it would have been a very great mistake.In the fray they stabbed one of their number in the side, drew him out
of his room, and left him on the floor in the hall of the main building,
but one flight of stairs above the kitchen.Two nuns, who did the
chamber work, came down stairs, and, seeing him lie there helpless and
forsaken, they took him by the hair of the head and drew him down to the
kitchen.Here they began to torment him in the most cruel manner.They
burned sticks in the fire until the end was a live coal, put them into
his hands and closed them, pressing the burning wood into the flesh, and
thus producing the most exquisite pain.At least this would have
been the result if he had realized their cruelty.But I think he was
insensible before they touched him, or if not, must have died very soon
after, for I am sure he was dead when I first saw him.I went to them and remonstrated against such inhuman conduct.But one of
the nuns replied, "That man has tormented me more than I can him, if I
do my best, and I wish him to know how good it is.""But," said I, "some
one will come in, and you will be caught in the act.""I'll risk that,"
said she, "they are quarreling all over the house, and will have enough
to do to look after each other for a while, I assure you.""But the man
is dead," said I."How can you treat a senseless corpse in that way?""I'm afraid he is dead," she replied, he don't move at all, and I can't
feel his heart beat; but I did hope to make him realize how good the
fire feels."Meanwhile, the blood was flowing from the wound in his side, and ran
over the floor.The sight of this alarmed them, and they drew him into
another dark hall, and left him beside the door of a room used for
punishment.They then came back, locked the hall door, and washed up the
blood.They expected to be punished for moving the dead body, but the
floor was dry before any of the priests came in, and I do not think it
was ever known.Perhaps they did not remember events as distinctly as
they might under other circumstances, and it is very possible, that,
when they found the corpse they might not have been able to say whether
it was where they left it, or not.We all rejoiced over the death of
that priest.He was a very cruel man; had punished me times without
number, but, though I was glad he was dead, I could not have touched him
when he lay helpless and insensible.A few weeks after the events just related, another trifling occurrence
brought me into collision with the Abbess.And here let me remark that
I have no way, by which to ascertain at what particular time certain
events transpired.The reader will understand that I write this
narrative from memory, and our life at the nunnery was so monotonous,
the days and weeks passed by with such dull, and irksome uniformity,
that sometimes our frequent punishments were the only memorable events
to break in upon the tiresome sameness of our unvarying life.Of course
the most simple thing was regarded by us as a great event, something
worthy of special notice, because, for the time, it diverted our minds
from the peculiar restraints of our disagreeable situation.To illustrate this remark let me relate an incident that transpired
about this time.I was one day sent to a part of the house where I was
not in the habit of going.I was passing along a dark hall, when a ray
of light from an open door fell upon my path.I looked up, and as the
door at that moment swung wide open, I saw, before a glass, in a richly
furnished room, the most beautiful woman I ever beheld.From the purity
of her complexion, and the bright color of her cheeks and lips, I could
have taken her for a piece of wax work, but for the fact that she was
carelessly arranging her hair.She was tall, and elegant in person,
with a countenance of such rare and surpassing beauty, I involuntarily
exclaimed, "What a beautiful woman!"She turned towards me with a
smile of angelic sweetness, while an expression of sympathetic emotion
overspread her exquisitely moulded features, which seemed to say as
plainly as though she had spoken in words, "Poor child, I pity you."I now became conscious that I was breaking the rules of the house, and
hastened away.But O, how many days my soul fed on that smile!I never
saw the lady again, her name I could never know, but that look of
tenderness will never be forgotten.It was something to think of through
many dreary hours, something to look back to, and be grateful for, all
the days of my life.The priests had a large quantity of sap
gathered from the maple trees, and brought to the nunnery to be boiled
into sugar.Another nun and myself were left to watch it, keep the
kettle filled up, and prevent it from burning.It was boiled in the
large caldron of which I have before spoken, and covered with a large,
thin, wooden cover.The sap had boiled some time, and become very thick.I was employed in filling up the kettle when the Abbess came into the
room, and after a few inquiries, directed me to stand upon the cover of
the caldron, and fix a large hook directly over it.I objected, for I
know full well that it would not bear a fourth part of my weight.She
then took hold of me, and tried to force me to step upon it, but I knew
I should be burned to death, for the cover, on account of its enormous
size was made as thin as possible, that we might be able to lift it.When I saw that she was determined to make me yield, in self defence,
I threw her upon the floor.Would that I had been content to stop
here.When I saw her in my power, and remembered how much I
had suffered from her, my angry passions rose, and I thought only of
revenge.I commenced beating her with all my might, and when I stopped from mere
exhaustion, the other nun caught her by the hair and began to draw
her round the room.She struggled and shrieked, but she could not help
herself.Her screams, however, alarmed the house, and hearing one of the
priests coming, the nun gave her a kick and left her.The priest
asked what we were doing, and the Abbess related with all possible
exaggeration, the story of our cruelty.asked the priest "You gave them some provocation, or they never would
treat you so."She was then obliged to tell what had passed between us,
and he said she deserved to suffer for giving such an order."Why," said
he, "that cover would not have held her a moment, and she would most
assuredly have burned to death."He punished us all; the Abbess for
giving the order, and us for abusing her.I should not have done this
thing, had I not come off so well, when I once before attempted to
defend myself; but my success at that time gave me courage to try it
again.My punishment was just, and I bore it very well, consoled by the
thought that justice was awarded to the Abbess, as well as myself.SICKNESS AND DEATH OF A SUPERIOR.The next excitement in our little community was caused by the sickness
and death of our Superior.I do not know what her disease was, but she
was sick two weeks, and one of the nuns from the kitchen was sent to
take care of her.One night she was so much worse, the nun thought she
would die, and she began to torment her in the most inhuman manner.She
had been severely punished a short time before at the instigation of
this woman, and she then swore revenge if she ever found an opportunity.She was in her power, too weak to resist or call
for assistance, and she resolved to let her know by experience how
bitterly she had made others suffer in days gone by.It was a fiendish
spirit, undoubtedly, that prompted her to seek revenge upon the dying,
but what else could we expect?She only followed the example of her
elders, and if she went somewhat beyond their teachings, she had, as we
shall see, her reasons for so doing.With hot irons she burned her on
various parts of her person, cut great gashes in the flesh upon her
face, sides, and arms, and then rubbed salt and pepper into the wounds.The wretched woman died before morning, and the nun went to the priest
and told him that the Superior was dead, and that she had killed her.The priests were immediately all called together, and the Bishop called
upon for counsel.He sentenced her to be hung that morning in the chapel
before the assembled household.The Abbess came and informed us what had
taken place, and directed us to get ready and go to the chapel.When we
entered, the doomed girl sat upon a chair on the altar.She was clad
in a white robe, with a white cap on her head, and appeared calm,
self-possessed, and even joyful.The Bishop asked her if she had
anything to say for herself.She immediately rose and said, "I have
killed the Superior, for which I am to be hung.I know that I deserve
to die, but I have suffered more than death many times over, from
punishments inflicted by her order.For many years my life has been one
of continual suffering; and for what?For just nothing at all, or for
the most simple things.Is it right, is it just to starve a person two
whole days for shutting the door a little too hard?or to burn one with
hot irons because a little water was accidentally spilt on the floor?Yet for these and similar things I have again and again been tortured
within an inch of my life.Now that I am to be hung, I am glad of
it, for I shall die quick, and be out of my misery, instead of being
tortured to death by inches.I did this thing for this very purpose,
for I do not fear death nor anything that comes after it.And the story of
heaven and hell, purgatory, and the Virgin Mary; why, it's all a humbug,
like the rest of the vile stuff you call religion.You wont catch us nuns believing it, and more than all that, you don't
believe it yourselves, not one of you."She sat down, and they put a cap over her head and face, drew it tight
around her neck, adjusted the rope, and she was launched into eternity.To me it seemed a horrid thing, and I could not look upon her dying
struggles.I did not justify the girl in what she had done, yet I knew
that the woman would have died if she had let her alone; and I also knew
that worse things than that were done in the nunnery almost every day,
and that too by the very men who had taken her life.I left the chapel
with a firm resolve to make one more effort to escape from a thraldom
that everyday became more irksome.At the door the Abbess met me, and led me to a room I had never seen
before, where, to my great surprise, I found my bed.She said it was
removed by her order, and in future I was to sleep in that room.I exclaimed, quite forgetting, in the agitation of
the moment, the rule of silent obedience.But she did not condescend
to notice either my question or the unpleasant feelings which must have
been visible in my features.I had never
slept in a room alone a night in my life.Another nun always occupied
the room with me, and when she was absent, as she often was when under
punishment, the Abbess slept there, so that I was never alone.I did
not often meet the girl with whom I slept, as she did not work in the
kitchen, but whenever I did, I felt as pleased as though she had been my
sister.Yet I never spoke to her, nor did she ever attempt to converse
with me.Yes, strange as it may seem, incredible as my reader may think
it, it is a fact, that during all the years we slept together, not one
word ever passed between us.We did not even dare to communicate our
thoughts by signs, lest the Abbess should detect us.That night I spent in my new room; but I could not sleep.I had heard
strange hints about some room where no one could sleep, and where no one
liked to go, though for what reason I could never learn.When I first
entered, I discovered that the floor was badly stained, and, while
speculating on the cause of those stains, I came to the conclusion that
this was the room to which so much mystery was attached.It was
very dark, with no window in it, situated in the midst of the house,
surrounded by other rooms, and no means of ventilation except the door.I did not close my eyes during the whole night.I imagined that the door
opened and shut, that persons were walking in the room, and I am
certain that I heard noises near my bed for which I could not account.Altogether, it was the most uncomfortable night I ever spent, and
I believe that few persons would have felt entirely at ease in my
situation.To such a degree did these superstitious fears assail me, I felt as
though I would endure any amount of physical suffering rather than stay
there another night.Resolved to brave everything, I went to a priest
and asked permission to speak to him.It was an unusual thing, and I
think his curiosity was excited, for it was only in extreme cases that
a nun ventures to appeal to a priest When I told him my story, he seemed
much surprised, and asked by whose order my bed was moved to that room.I informed him of all the particulars, when he ordered me to move my bed
back again."No one," said he, "has slept in that room for years, and we
do not wish any one to sleep there."I accordingly moved the bed back,
and as I had permission from the priest, the Abbess dared not find fault
with me.STUDENTS AT THE ACADEMY.Through the winter I continued to work as usual, leading the same dull,
dreary, and monotonous life, varied only by pains, and privations.In
the spring a slight change was made in the household arrangements, and
for a short time I assisted some of the other nuns to do the chamber
work for the students at the academy.There was an under-ground passage
from the convent to the cellar of the academy through which we passed.Before we entered, the doors and windows were securely fastened, and the
students ordered to leave their rooms, and not return again till we had
left.They were also forbidden to speak to us, but whenever the teachers
were away, they were sure to come back to their rooms, and ask us all
manner of questions.They wished to know, they said, how long we were
going to stay in the convent, if we really enjoyed the life we had
chosen, and were happy in our retirement; if we had not rather return
to the world, go into company, get married, etc.I suppose they really
thought that we could leave at any time if we chose.But we did not dare
to answer their questions, or let them know the truth.One day, when we went to do the work, we found in one of the rooms, some
men who were engaged in painting.We did not dare to reply, lest they should betray us.They then began to
make remarks about us, some of which I well remember.One of them said,
"I don't believe they are used very well; they look as though they were
half starved."Another replied, "I know they do; there is certainly
something wrong about these convents, or the nuns would not all look so
pale and thin."I suspect the man little thought how much truth there
was in his remarks.Soon after the painters left we were all taken suddenly ill.Some were
worse than others, but all were unwell except one nun.As all exhibited
the same symptoms, we were supposed to have taken poison, and suspicion
fastened on that nun.She was put upon the rack, and when she saw that
her guilt could not be concealed, she confessed that she poisoned the
water in the well, but she would not tell what she put into it, nor
where she got it.She said she did not do it to injure the nuns, for she
thought they were allowed so little drink with their food, they would
not be affected by it, while those who drank more, she hoped to kill.She disliked all the priests, and the Superior, and would gladly have
murdered them all.But for one priest in particular, she felt all the
hatred that a naturally malignant spirit, excited by repeated acts
of cruelty, is capable of.He had punished her repeatedly, and as she
thought, unjustly, and she resolved to avenge herself and destroy her
enemy, even though the innocent should suffer with the guilty.This was
all wrong, fearfully wrong we must admit.But while we look with
horror at the enormity of her crime let us remember that she had great
provocation.I hope there are few who could have sought revenge in the
way she did; yet I cannot believe that any one would endure from another
what she was compelled to suffer from that man, without some feelings of
resentment.Let us not judge too harshly this erring sister, for if
her crime was great, her wrongs were neither small nor few, and her
punishment was terrible.They tortured her a long time to make her tell what kind of poison she
put in the well, and where she obtained it.They supposed she must have
got it from the painters, but she would never tell where she procured
it.This fact proves that she had some generous feelings left.Under any
other circumstances such magnanimity would have been highly applauded,
and in my secret soul I could not but admire the firmness with which
she bore her sufferings.She was kept upon the rack until all her joints
were dislocated, and the flesh around them mortified.They then carried
her to her room, removed the bed, and laid her upon the bedcord.The
nuns were all assembled to look at her, and take warning by her sad
fate.Such a picture of misery I never saw before.She seemed to have
suffered even more than the old lady I saw in the cellar.It was but a
moment, however, that we were allowed to gaze upon her shrunken ghastly
features, and then she was hid from our sight forever.The nuns,
except two or three, were sent from the room, and thus the murder was
consummated.There was one young student at the academy whose name was Smalley.He
was from New England, and his father lived at St.Albans, Vt., where he
had wealth and influence.This young man had a little sister who used to
visit at the convent, whom they called Sissy Smalley.She was young, but
handsome, witty and intelligent.For one of her age, she was very much
refined in her manners.They allowed her to go anywhere in the building
except the private apartments where those deeds of darkness were
performed which would not bear the pure light of heaven.I presume that
no argument could convince little Sissy Smalley that such rooms were
actually in the nunnery.She had been all over it, she would tell
you, and she never saw any torture rooms, never heard of any one being
punished, or anything of the kind.Such reports would appear to her as
mere slanders, yet God knows they are true.I well remember how I used
to shudder to hear that child praise the nunnery, tell what a nice,
quiet place it was, and how she would like it for a permanent home.I
hope her brother will find out the truth about it in season to prevent
his beautiful sister from ever becoming a nun.SECOND ESCAPE FROM THE NUNNERY.It was early in the spring, when I again succeeded in making my escape.It was on a Saturday evening, when the priests and nearly all the nuns
were In the chapel.I was assisted out of the yard in the same way I was
before, and by the same person.There was still snow upon the ground and
that they might not be able to track me, I entered the market and walked
the whole length of it without attracting observation.From thence I
crossed the street, when I saw a police officer coming directly towards
me.I turned down a dark alley and ran for my life, I knew not whither.It is the duty of every police officer in Montreal to accompany any of
the sisters whom they chance to meet in the street, and I knew if he saw
me he would offer to attend me wherever I wished to go.Such an offer
might not be refused, and, certainly, his company, just at that time,
was neither desirable nor agreeable.At the end of the alley, I found myself near a large church, and two
priests were coming directly towards me.It is said "the drowning catch
at straws."Whether this be true or not, the plan which I adopted in
this emergency seemed as hopeless for my preservation, as a straw for
the support of the drowning.Yet it was the only course I could pursue,
for to escape unseen was impossible.I therefore resolved to go boldly
past them, and try to make them think I was a Superior going to church.Trying to appear as indifferent as possible, I approached, and saluted
them in the usual way.This is done by throwing forward the open hand,
and passing it down by the side with a slight inclination of the head.The priest returns the salutation by standing with uncovered head till
you have passed.In the present instance, the priest said, as he removed
his hat, "Church is in, Sister."With
trembling limbs I ascended the Church steps, and stood there till the
priests were out of sight.It was but a moment, yet it seemed a long
time.I knew the house was filled with priests and students, some of
whom would be sure to recognize me at once.The thought of it nearly took away my breath.The cold perspiration
started from my brow, and I felt as though I should faint.But my fears
were not realized, and as soon as the priests were out of sight, I went
on again.Soon I came to a cross street, leading to the river, where a
large hotel stood on the corner.I followed the river, and travelled all
night.The next day, fearing to be seen by people going to church, I hid
in a cellar hole, covered over with old boards and timbers.At night I went on again, and on Sunday evening about ten o'clock I came
to a small village where I resolved to seek food and lodging.Tired,
hungry and cold, feeling as though I could not take another step, I
called at one of the houses, and asked permission to stay over night.The lady gave me some milk, and I retired to
rest.Next morning, I rose early and left before any of the family were
up.I knew they were all Romanists, and I feared to trust them.Oars, a town, named, as I have been
informed, for the man who owns a great part of it.I stopped at a public
house, which, they called, "Lady St.Oars," where they were eating
dinner.The landlady invited me to dine with them, and asked if I
belonged to the convent in that place.I told her that I did, for I knew
if I told the truth they would suspect me at once.I
replied in the affirmative, and she gave me a slice of bread and butter,
a piece of cheese and a silver cup full of milk.I ate it all, and would
gladly have eaten more, for I was very hungry.As I was about to leave,
the lady remarked, "There was grease in that cheese, was it a sin for me
to give it to you?"I assured her it was not, for I was allowed to eat
milk, and the cheese being made of milk, there could be no sin in my
eating it I told her that, so far from committing a sin, the blessed
Virgin was pleased with her benevolent spirit, and would, in some way,
reward her for her kindness.Oars, I went on to the next town where I arrived at
seven in the evening.I called at the house of a Frenchman, and asked if
I could stay over night, or at least, be allowed to rest awhile.The man
said I was welcome to come in, but he had no place where I could sleep.They were just sitting down to supper, which consisted of pea soup;
but the lady said there was meat in it, and she would not invite me
to partake of it; but she gave me a good supper of bread and milk.She
thought I was a Sister of Charity, and I did not tell her that I was
not.After supper, she saw that my skirt was stiff with mud, and kindly
offered to wash it out for me, saying, I could rest till it was dry.I joyfully accepted her offer, and reclining in a corner, enjoyed a
refreshing slumber.It was near twelve o'clock before I was ready to go on again, and when
I asked how far it was to the next town, they manifested a great anxiety
for my welfare.The man said it was seven miles to Mt.Bly, but he hoped
I did not intend to walk.I told him I did not know whether I should or
not, perhaps I might ride."But are you not afraid to go on alone?"Dennis is a bad place for a lady to be out alone at night,
and you must pass a grave-yard in the south part of the town; dare you
go by it, in the dark?"I assured him that I had no fear whatever, that
would prevent me from going past the grave-yard.I had never committed
a crime, never injured any one, and I did not think the departed would
come back to harm me.The lady said she would think of me with some
anxiety, for she should not dare to go past that grave-yard alone in the
dark.I again assured her that I had no cause to fear, had no crime on
my conscience, had been guilty of no neglect of duty, and if the living
would let me alone, I did not fear the dead.They thought I referred to
the low characters about town, and the lady replied, "I shall tell my
beads for you and the holy Virgin will protect you from all harm.But
remember," she continued, "whenever you pass this way, you will always
find a cordial welcome with us."I thanked her, and with a warm grasp of
the hand we parted.I
traveled all night, and late in the morning came to a respectable
looking farmhouse which I thought might be occupied by Protestants.I
always noticed that their houses were neater, and more comfortable than
those of the Romanists in the same condition in life.In the present
instance I was not disappointed in my expectations.The lady received me
kindly, gave me some breakfast, and directed me to the next village.I
walked all day, and near night arrived at St.Mary's, where I called at
a house, and asked permission to sit and rest awhile.They gave me an
invitation to enter, but did not offer refreshments.I did not like
to ask for charity if I could avoid it, and I thought it possible they
might ask me to stay over night.But they did not, and after a half
hour's rest I rose to depart, and thanking them for their kindness
inquired how far it was to the next house.They said it was seven miles
to the first house, and nine to the next village.With a sad heart, I once more pursued my lonely way.Soon it began to
rain, and the night came on, dark and dismal, cold and stormy, with
a high wind that drove the rain against my face with pitiless fury.I entered a thick wood where no ray of light could penetrate, and at
almost every step, I sank over shoes in the mud.Thus I wandered on,
reflecting bitterly on my wretched fate.All the superstitious fears,
which a convent life is so well calculated to produce, again assailed
me, and I was frightened at my own wild imaginings.I thought of the
nuns who had been murdered so cruelly, and I listened to the voice of
the storm, as to the despairing wail of a lost soul.The wind swept
fiercely through the leafless branches, now roaring like a tornado,
again rising to a shrill shriek, or a prolonged whistle, then sinking to
a hollow murmer, and dying away in a low sob which sounded to my excited
fancy like the last convulsive sigh of a breaking heart.Once and again
I paused, faint and dizzy with hunger and fatigue, feeling as though
I could go no further.And go on I did, though, as I now look back upon that night's
experience, I wonder how I managed to do so.But a kind providence,
undoubtedly, watched over me, and good angels guided me on my way.Some
time in the night, I think it must have been past twelve o'clock, I
became so very weary I felt that I must rest awhile at all events.It
was so dark I could not see a step before me, but I groped my way to a
fence, seated myself on a stone with my head resting against the rails,
and in that position I fell asleep.How long I slept, I do not know.When I awoke, my clothes were drenched with rain, and I was so stiff and
lame, I could hardly move.But go I must, so I resolved to make the
best of it, and hobble along as well as I could.At last I reached the
village, but it was not yet morning, and I dared not stop.I kept on
till daylight, and as soon as I thought people were up, I went up to
a house and rapped.A woman came to the door, and I asked if she would
allow me to go in, and dry my clothes, and I would have added, get some
breakfast, but her looks restrained me.They were getting breakfast, but
did not invite me to partake of it, and I dared not ask for anything to
eat.When my clothes were dry, I thanked them for the use of their fire,
and inquired how far it was to the next village.They said the next town
was Highgate, but they did not know the distance.My tears flowed freely when I again found myself in the street, cold,
hungry, almost sick, and entirely friendless.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.One thought alone gave courage to my desponding
heart, buoyed up my sinking spirits, and restored strength to my weary
limbs.I was striving for liberty, that priceless boon, so dear to every
human heart.Nerved to renewed effort by thoughts like these, I toiled onward.All
that day I walked without a particle of nourishment.When I reached
Highgate, it was eleven o'clock at night, but in one house I saw a
light, and I ventured to rap at the door.It was opened by a pale, but
pleasant looking woman."Kind lady," said I, "will you please tell me
how far it is to the States?"she exclaimed, and in a
moment she seemed to understand both my character and situation."You
are now in Vermont State," said she, "but come in child, you look sad
and weary."I at once accepted her offer, and when she asked how far I
was traveling, and how I came to be out so late, I did not hesitate
to reveal to her my secret, for I was sure she could be trusted.She invited me to spend the remainder of the night, and gave me some
refreshment.She was nursing a sick woman, which accounted for her being
up so late, but did not prevent her from attending to all my wants, and
making me as comfortable as possible.When she saw that my feet were
wounded, badly swollen, and covered with blood and dirt, she procured
warm water, and with her own hands bathed, and made them clean, with the
best toilet soap.She expressed great sympathy for the sad condition my
feet were in, and asked if I had no shoes?I told her that my shoes were
made of cloth, and soon wore out; that what was left of them, I lost in
the mud, when traveling through the woods in the dark.She then procured
a pair of nice woollen stockings, and a pair of new shoes, some under
clothes, and a good flannel skirt, which she begged me to wear for her
sake.I accepted them gratefully, but the shoes I could not wear, my
feet were so sore.She said I could take them with me, and she gave me
a pair of Indian moccasins to wear till my feet were healed.Angel of
mercy that she was; may God's blessing rest upon her for her kindness to
the friendless wanderer.The next morning the good lady urged me to stay with her, at least, for
a time, and said I should be welcome to a home there for the rest of my
life.Grateful as I was for her offer, I was forced to decline it, for
I knew that I could not remain so near Montreal in safety.She said the
"select men" of the town would protect me, if they were made acquainted
with my peculiar situation.she little knew the character
of a Romish priest!Her guileless heart did not suspect the cunning
artifice by which they accomplish whatever they undertake.And those
worthy "select men," I imagine, were not much better informed than
herself.Sure I am, that any protection they could offer me, would
not, in the least degree, shield me from the secret intrigue, the
affectionate, maternal embrace of holy Mother Church.When she found that, notwithstanding all her offers, I was resolved to
go, she put into a basket, a change of clothing, the shoes she had given
me, and a good supply of food which she gave me for future use.But the
most acceptable part of her present was a sun-bonnet; for thus far I had
nothing on my head but the cap I wore in the convent.She gave me some
money, and bade me go to Swanton, and there, she said, I could take the
cars.I accordingly bade her farewell, and, basket in hand, directed my
steps toward the depot some seven miles distant, as I was informed; but
I thought it a long seven miles, as I passed over it with my sore feet,
the blood starting at every step.On my arrival at the depot, a man came to me, and asked where I wished
to go.I told him I wished to go as far into the State as my money would
carry me.He procured me a ticket, and said it would take me to St.He asked me where I came from, but I begged to be excused from
answering questions.He then conducted me to the ladies room, and left
me, saying the cars would be along in about an hour.In this room, several ladies were waiting to take the cars.As I walked
across the room, one of them said, in a tone that grated harshly on my
feelings, "Your skirt is below your dress."I did not feel very good
natured, and instead of saying "thank you," as I should have done, I
replied in the most impudent manner, "Well, it is clean, if it is in
sight."The lady said no more, and I sat down upon a sofa and fell
asleep.As I awoke, one of the ladies said, "I wonder who that poor girl
is!"I was bewildered, and, for the moment, could not think where I was,
but I thought I must make some reply, and rousing myself I turned to
her, and said, "I am a nun, if you wish to know, and I have just escaped
from a convent."She gave me a searching look, and said, "Well, I must
confess you do look like one.I often visit in Montreal where I see a
great many of them, and they always look poor and pale.Will you allow
me to ask you a few questions?"By this time, I was wide awake,
and realized perfectly where I was, and the folly of making such an
imprudent disclosure.I would have given much to recall those few words,
for I had a kind of presentiment that they would bring me trouble.I
begged to be excused from answering any questions, as I was almost crazy
with thinking of the past and did not wish to speak of it.The lady said no more for some time, but she kept her eye upon me, in
a way that I did not like; and I began to consider whether I had better
wait for the cars, or start on foot.I was sorry for my imprudence, but
it could not be helped now, and I must do the best I could to avoid the
unpleasant consequences which might result from it.I had just made up
my mind to go on, when I heard in the far distance, the shrill whistle
of the approaching train; that train which I fondly hoped would bear me
far away from danger, and onward to the goal of my desires.At this moment, the lady crossed the room, and seating herself by my
side, asked, "Would you not like to go and live with me?I have one
waiting maid now, but I wish for another, and if you will go, I will
take you and give you good wages.Your work will not be hard; will you
go?""Then I
shall not go with you," said I."No money could induce me to return
there again."said she, with a peculiar smile, "I see how it is,
but you need not fear to trust me.I will protect you, and never
suffer you to be taken back to the convent."I saw that I had made
unconsciously another imprudent revelation, and resolved to say no more.I was about to leave her, but she drew me back saying, "I will give you
some of my clothes, and I can make them fit you so well that no one will
ever recognize you.I shall have plenty of time to alter them if they
require it, for the train that I go in, will not be along for about
three hours; you can help me, and in that time we will get you nicely
fixed."I could hardly repress a smile when I saw how earnest she was, and I
thought it a great pity that a plan so nicely laid out should be so
suddenly deranged, but I could not listen to her flatteries.I suspected
that she was herself in the employ of the priests, and merely wished to
get me back that she might betray me.She had the appearance of being
very wealthy, was richly clad, wore a gold watch, chain, bracelets,
breastpin, ear rings, and many finger rings, all of the finest gold.But
with all her wealth and kind offers, I dare not trust her.I thought she
looked annoyed when I refused to go with her, but when I rose to go
to the cars, a look of angry impatience stole over, her fine features,
which convinced me that I had escaped a snare.The cars came at length, and I was soon on my way to St.I was
very sick, and asked a gentleman near me to raise the windows.He did
so, and inquired how far I was going.I informed him, when he remarked
that he was somewhat acquainted in St.Albans, and asked with whom I
designed to stop.I told him I had no friends or acquaintance in the
place, but I hoped to get employment in some protestant family.He said
he could direct me to some gentlemen who would, he thought, assist me.One in particular, he mentioned as being a very wealthy man, and kept a
number of servants; perhaps he would employ me.This gentleman's name was Branard, and my informant spoke so highly of
the family, I immediately sought them out on leaving the cars, and was
at once employed by Mrs.Here I found a quiet,
happy home.Branard was a kind sympathizing woman, and to her, I
confided the history of my convent life.She would not allow me to work
hard, for she saw that my nerves were easily excited.She made me sit
with her in her own room a great part of the time, and did not wish me
to go out alone.They had several boarders in the family, and one
of them was a brother-in-law [Footnote: This gentleman was Mr.Z. K.
Pangborn, late editor of the Worcester Daily Transcript.Pangborn give their testimony of the truth of this statement.]His name I have forgotten; it was not a common name, but
he married Mrs.Branard's sister, and with his wife resided there all
the time that I was with them.Branard was away from home most of
the time, so that I saw but little of him.They had an Irish girl in the
kitchen, named Betsy.She was a kind, pleasant girl, and she thought me
a strict Romanist because I said my prayers so often, and wore the Holy
Scapulary round my neck.This Scapulary is a band with a cross on one
side, and on the other, the letters "J. H.which signify, "Jesus The
Savior of Man."At this place I professed great regard for the Church of Rome, and no
one but Mrs.Branard was acquainted with my real character and history.When they asked my name, I told them they could call me Margaret, but it
was an assumed name.My own, for reasons known only by myself, I did
not choose to reveal.I supposed, of course, they would regard me with
suspicion for a while, but I saw nothing of the kind.They treated me
with great respect, and no questions were ever asked.Perhaps I did
wrong in changing my name, but I felt that I was justified in using any
means to preserve my liberty.Four happy weeks I enjoyed unalloyed satisfaction in the bosom of this
charming family.It was a new thing for me to feel at home, contented,
and undisturbed; to have every one around me treat me with kindness and
even affection.I sometimes feared it was too good to last.Branard
in particular, I shall ever remember with grateful and affectionate
regard.She was more like a mother to me, than a mistress, and I shall
ever look back to the time I spent with her, as a bright spot in the
otherwise barren desert of my life.Better, far better would it have
been for me had I never left her.But I became alarmed, and thought the
convent people were after me.It was no idle whim, no imaginary terror.I had good cause to fear, for I had several times seen a priest go
past, and gaze attentively at the house.I knew him at the first glance,
having often seen him in Montreal.Then my heart told me that they had traced me to this place, and
were now watching a chance to get hold of me.Imagine, if you can, my
feelings.Would they be allowed to take
me back to those fearful cells, where no ray of mercy could ever reach
me?Frightened, and almost beside
myself, I resolved to make an effort to find a more secure place.I
therefore left those kind friends in the darkness of night, without one
word of farewell, and without their knowledge.I knew they would not
allow me to go, if they were apprised of my design.In all probability,
they would have ridiculed my fears, and bade me rest in peace.How could
I expect them to comprehend my danger, when they knew so little of the
machination of my foes?I intended to go further into the state, but
did not wish to have any one know which way I had gone.It was a sad
mistake, but how often in this world do we plunge into danger when we
seek to avoid it!How often fancy ourselves in security when we stand
upon the very brink of ruin!Branard's in the evening, and called upon a family in the
neighborhood whose acquaintance I had made, and whom I wished to see
once more, though I dared not say farewell.I left them between the
hours of nine and ten, and set forward on my perilous journey.I had
gone but a short distance when I heard the sound of wheels and the heavy
tread of horses' feet behind me.My heart beat with such violence it
almost stopped my breath, for I felt that they were after me.But there
was no escape--no forest or shelter near where I could seek protection.On came the furious beasts, driven by no gentle hand.They came up with
me, and I almost began to hope that my fears were groundless, when the
horses suddenly stopped, a strong hand grasped me, a gag was thrust into
my mouth, and again the well-known box was taken from the wagon.Another
moment and I was securely caged, and on my way back to Montreal.Two men
were in the wagon and two rode on horseback beside it.Bly, where they stopped to change horses, and the two
men on horseback remained there, while the other two mounted the wagon
and drove to Sorel.Here the box was taken out and carried on board a
boat, where two priests were waiting for me.When the boat started, they
took me out for the first time after I was put into it at St.Three days we had been on the way, and I had tasted neither food nor
drink.How little did I think when I took my tea at Mr.Branard's the
night I left that it was the last refreshment I would have for SEVEN
DAYS; yet such was the fact.And how little did they think, as they lay
in their quiet beds that night, that the poor fugitive they had taken to
their home was fleeing for life, or for that which, to her, was better
than life.Bitterly did I reproach myself for leaving
those kind friends as I did, for I thought perhaps if I had remained
there, they would not have dared to touch me.Such were my feelings
then; but as I now look back, I can see that it would have made little
difference whether I left or remained.They were bound to get me, at all
events, and if I had stopped there until they despaired of catching me
secretly, they would undoubtedly have come with an officer, and accused
me of some crime, as a pretext for taking me away.Then, had any one
been so far interested for me as to insist on my having a fair trial,
how easy for them to produce witnesses enough to condemn me!Those
priests have many ways to accomplish their designs.The American people
don't know them yet; God grant they never may.On my arrival at the nunnery I was taken down the coal grate, and
fastened to an iron ring in the back part of a cell.The Archbishop then
came down and read my punishment.Notwithstanding the bitter grief that
oppressed my spirit, I could not repress a smile of contempt as the
great man entered my cell.I remembered that before I ran away, my
punishments were assigned by a priest, but the first time I fled from
them a Bishop condescended to read my sentence, and now his honor the
Archbishop graciously deigned to illume my dismal cell with the light of
his countenance, and his own august lips pronounced the words of doom.Was I rising in their esteem, or did they think to frighten me into
obedience by the grandeur of his majestic mien?Such were my thoughts as this illustrious personage proceeded slowly,
and with suitable dignity, to unroll the document that would decide my
fate.It might be for aught I knew, or cared
to know.I had by this time become perfectly reckless, and the whole
proceeding seemed so ridiculous, I found it exceedingly difficult to
maintain a demeanor sufficiently solemn for the occasion.But when
the fixed decree came forth, when the sentence fell upon my ear that
condemned me to SEVEN DAYS' STARVATION, it sobered me at once.Yet even
then the feeling of indignation was so strong within me, I could not
hold my peace.I would speak to that man, if he killed me for it.Looking him full in the face (which, by the way, I knew was considered
by him a great crime), I asked, "Do you ever expect to die?"I did not,
of course, expect an answer, but he replied, with a smile, "Yes; but
you will die first."He then asked how long I had fasted, and I replied,
"Three days."He said, "You will fast four days more, and you will be
punished every day until next December, when you will take the black
veil."As he was leaving the room, he remarked, "We do not usually have
the nuns take the black veil until they are twenty-one; but you have
such good luck in getting away, we mean to put you where you can't do
it."And with this consoling thought he left me--left me in darkness and
despair, to combat, as best I could, the horrors of starvation.This
was in the early part of winter, and only about a year would transpire
before I entered that retreat from which none ever returned.And then to
be punished every day for a year!The priest came every
morning, with his dark lantern, to look at me; but he never spoke.On
the second day after my return, I told him if he would bring me a little
piece of bread, I would never attempt to run away again, but would serve
him faithfully the rest of my life.Had he given it to me, I would have
faithfully kept my word; but he did not notice me, and closing the door,
he left me once more to pass through all the agonies of starvation.Whether I remained in the cell the
other two days, or was taken out before the time expired, I do not know.This much, however, I do know, as a general rule a nun's punishment is
never remitted.If she lives, it is well; if she dies, no matter; there
are enough more, and no one will ever call them to an account for the
murder.But methinks I hear the reader ask, "Did they not fear the judgment of
God and a future retribution?"In reply I can only state what I believe
to be the fact.It is my firm belief that not more than one priest in
ten thousand really believes in the truth of Christianity, or even in
the existence of a God.They are all Infidels or Atheists; and how can
they be otherwise?It is the legitimate fruit of that system of deceit
which they call religion.Of course I only give this as my opinion,
founded on what I have seen and heard.You can take it, reader, for what
it is worth; believe it or not, just us you please; but I assure you I
have often heard the nuns say that they did not believe in any religion.The professions of holiness of heart and parity of life so often made
by the priests they KNOW to be nothing but a hypocritical pretence, and
their ceremonies they regard as a ridiculous farce.For some time after I was taken from the cell I lay in a state of
partial unconsciousness, but how long, I do not know.I have no
recollection of being taken up stairs, but I found myself on my bed, in
my old room, and on the stand beside me were several cups, vials, etc.The Abbess who sat beside me, occasionally gave me a tea-spoonful
of wine or brandy, and tried to make me eat.Ere long, my appetite
returned, but it was several weeks before my stomach was strong enough
to enable me to satisfy in any degree, the cravings of hunger.When I
could eat, I gained very fast, and the Abbess left me in the care of
a nun, who came in occasionally to see if I wanted anything.This nun
often stopped to talk with me, when she thought no one was near, and
expressed great curiosity to know what I saw in the world; if people
were kind to me, and if I did not mean to get away again, if possible, I
told her I should not; but she replied, "I don't believe that.You will
try again, and you will succeed yet, if you keep up good courage.You
are so good to work, they do not wish to part with you, and that is one
reason why they try so hard to get you back again.But never mind,
they won't get you next time."I assured her I should not try to escape
again, for they were sure to catch me, and as they had almost killed me
this time, they would quite the next.I did not dare to trust her, for I
supposed the Superior had given her orders to question me.I was still weak, so weak that I could hardly walk when they obliged me
to go into the kitchen to clean vegetables and do other light work, and
as soon as I had sufficient strength, to milk the cows, and take the
care of the milk.They punished me every day, in accordance with the
Bishop's order, and sometimes, I thought, more than he intended.I wore
thorns on my head, and peas in my shoes, was whipped and pinched, burnt
with hot irons, and made to crawl through the underground passage I
have before described.In short, I was tortured and punished in every
possible way, until I was weary of my life.Still they were careful not
to go so far as to disable me from work.They did not care how much I
suffered, if I only performed my daily task.There was an underground passage leading from the nunnery to a place
which they called, "Providence," in the south part of the city.I do not
know whether it is a school, or a convent, or what it is, but I think it
must be some distance, from what I heard said about it.The priest often
spoke of sending me there, but for some reason, he did not make me
go.Still the frequent reference to what I so much dreaded, kept me
in constant apprehension and alarm.I have heard the priest say that
underground passages extended from the convent in every direction, for
a distance of five miles; and I have reason to believe the statement is
true.But these reasons I may not attempt to give.There are things that
may not even be alluded to, and if it were possible to speak of them,
who would believe the story?As summer approached, I expected to be sent to the farm again, but for
some reason I was still employed in the kitchen.Yet I could not keep
my mind upon my work.The one great object of my life; the subject that
continually pressed upon my mind was the momentous question, how shall
I escape?To some it
would bring a joyous festival, but to me, the black veil and a life long
imprisonment.Once within those dreary walls, and I might as well hope
to escape from the grave.Such are the arrangements, there is no chance
for a nun to escape unless she is promoted to the office of Abbess or
Superior.Of course, but few of them can hope for this, especially,
if they are not contented; and certainly, in my case there was not the
least reason to expect anything of the kind.Knowing these facts, with
the horrors of the Secret Cloister ever before me, I felt some days as
though on the verge of madness.Before the nuns take the black veil, and
enter this tomb for the living, they are put into a room by themselves,
called the forbidden closet, where they spend six months in studying the
Black Book.Perchance, the reader will remember that when I first
came to this nunnery, I was taken by the door-tender to this forbidden
closet, and permitted to look in upon the wretched inmates.From that
time I always had the greatest horror of that room.I was never allowed
to enter it, and in fact never wished to do so, but I have heard the
most agonizing groans from those within, and sometimes I have heard them
laugh.Not a natural, hearty laugh, however, such as we hear from the
gay and happy, but a strange, terrible, sound which I cannot describe,
and which sent a thrill of terror through my frame, and seemed to chill
the very blood in my veins.I have heard the priests say, when conversing with each other, while I
was tidying their room, that many of these nuns lose their reason while
studying the Black Book.I can well believe this, for never in my
life did I ever witness an expression of such unspeakable, unmitigated
anguish, such helpless and utter despair as I saw upon the faces of
those nuns.Kept under lock and key, their
windows barred, and no air admitted to the room except what comes
through the iron grate of their windows from other apartments; compelled
to study, I know not what; with no hope of the least mitigation of their
sufferings, or relaxation of the stringent rules that bind them; no
prospect before them but a life-long imprisonment; what have they to
hope for?Surely, death and the grave are the only things to which they
can look forward with the least degree of satisfaction.Those nuns selected for this Secret Cloister are generally the fairest,
the most beautiful of the whole number.I used to see them in the
chapel, and some of them were very handsome.They dressed like the other
nuns, and always looked sad and broken hearted, but were not pale
and thin like the rest of us.I am sure they were not kept upon short
allowance as the others were, and starvation was not one of their
punishments, whatever else they might endure.The plain looking girls
were always selected to work in the kitchen, and do the drudgery about
the house.How often have I thanked God for my plain face!But for that,
I might not have been kept in the kitchen so long, and thus found means
to escape which I certainly could not have found elsewhere.With all my watching, and planning I did not find an opportunity to get
away till June.I then, succeeded in getting outside the convent yard
one evening between eight and nine o'clock.How I got there, is a secret
I shall never reveal.A few yards from the gate I was stopped by one of
the guard at the Barrack, who asked where I was going."To visit a sick
woman," I promptly replied, and he let me pass.Soon after this, before
my heart ceased to flutter, I thought I heard some one running after
me.I would never be caught and carried
back alive.My fate was at last, I thought, in my own hands.Better die
at once than to be chained like a guilty criminal, and suffer as I had
done before.Blame me not gentle reader, when I tell you that I stood
upon the bank of the river with exultant joy; and, as I pursued my
way along the tow-path, ready to spring into the water on the first
indication of danger, I rejoiced over the disappointment of my pursuers
in losing a servant who had done them so good service.At a little
distance I saw a ferry boat, but when I asked the captain to carry me
over the river, he refused.He was, probably, afraid of the police and
a fine, for no one can assist a run-away nun with impunity, if caught in
the act.He directed me, however, to the owner of the boat, who said I
could go if the captain was willing to carry me.I knew very well that
he would not, and I took my place in the boat as though I had a perfect
right to it.We were almost across the river, when the captain saw me, and gave
orders to turn back the boat, and leave me on the shore from whence we
started.From his appearance I thought we were pursued, and I was not
mistaken.Five priests were following us in another boat, and they too,
turned back, and reached the shore almost as soon as we did.I left the
boat and ran for my life.I was now sure that I was pursued; there could
be no doubt of that, for the sound of footsteps behind me came distinct
to my ear.At a little distance stood a small, white house.The thought gave me courage,
and I renewed my efforts.Nearer came the footsteps, but I reached the
house, and without knocking, or asking permission, I sprang through the
door.The people were in bed, in another room, but a man looked out, and
asked what I wanted."I've run away from the Grey
Nunnery, and they're after me.Hide me, O hide me, and God will bless
you!"As I spoke he put out his hand and opened the cellar door."Here,"
said he, "run down cellar, I'll be with you in a moment."I obeyed, and
he struck a light and followed.Pointing to a place where he kept ashes,
he said hastily, "Crawl in there."There was not a moment to lose, for
before he had covered up my hiding place, a loud knock was heard upon
the front door.Having extinguished his light, he ran up stairs, and
opened the door with the appearance of having just left his bed.he asked, "and what do you want this time of night?"One of
them replied, "We are in search of a nun, and are very sure she came in
here?""Well gentlemen," said he, "walk in, and see for yourselves.If she is here, you are at liberty to find her."Lighting a candle, he
proceeded to guide them over the house, which they searched until they
were satisfied.They then came down cellar, and I gave up all hope of
escape.Still, I resolved never to be taken alive.I could strangle
myself, and I would do it, rather than suffer as I did before.At that
moment I could truly say with the inspired penman, with whose language
I have since become familiar, "my soul chooseth strangling and death
rather than life."They looked all around me, and even into the place where I lay
concealed, but they did not find me.At length I heard them depart,
and so great was my joy, I could hardly restrain my feelings within the
bounds of decorum.I felt as though I must dance and sing, shout
aloud or leap for joy at my great deliverance.I am sure I should have
committed some extravagant act had not the gentleman at that moment
called me up, and told me that my danger was by no means past.This
information so dashed my cup of bliss that I was able to drink it
quietly.He gave me some refreshment, and as soon as safety would permit, saddled
his horse, and taking me on behind him, carried me six miles to another
boat, put me on board, and paid the captain three dollars to carry me
to Laprairie.On leaving me, he gave me twenty-five cents, and said,
"you'll be caught if you go with the other passengers."The captain said
he could hide me and no one know that I was on board, but himself.He
led me to the end of the boat, and put me upon a board over the horses.He fixed a strong cord for me to hold on by, and said, "you must be
careful and not fall down, for the horses would certainly kill you
before you could be taken out."The captain was very kind to me and when
I left him, gave me twenty-five cents, and some good advice.He said
I must hurry along as fast as possible, for it was Jubilee, and the
priests would all be in church at four o'clock.He also advised me not
to stop in any place where a Romish priest resided, "for," said he,
"the convent people have, undoubtedly, telegraphed all over the country
giving a minute description of your person, and the priests will all be
looking for you."Two days I travelled as fast as my strength would allow, when I came
to Sorel, which was on the other side of the river.Here I saw several
priests on the road coming directly towards me.That they were after me,
I had not a doubt.To escape by running, was out
of the question, but just at that moment my eye fell upon a boat near
the shore.I ran to the captain, and asked him to take me across the
river.He consented, and, as I expected, the priests took another boat
and followed us.Once more I gave myself up for lost, and prepared
to spring into the water, if they were likely to overtake me.The man
understood my feelings, and exerted all his strength to urge forward
the boat.At last it reached the shore, and as he helped me out he
whispered, "Now run."I did run, but though my own liberty was at
stake I could not help thinking about the consequences to that man if
I escaped, for I knew they would make him pay a heavy fine for his
benevolent act.A large house stood in my way, and throwing open the
door I exclaimed, "Are there any protestants here?""O, yes," replied
a man who sat there, "come with me."He led me to the kitchen, where a
large company of Irish men were rolling little balls on a table.I saw
the men were Irish and my first thought was, "I am betrayed."But my fears were soon relieved, for the man exclaimed, "Here is a
nun, inquiring for protestants.""Well," replied one who seemed to be
a leader, "this is the right place to find them.And then they all began to shout, "Down with the Catholics!I was frightened at their
violence, but their leader came to me, and with the kindness of a
brother, said, "Do not fear us.If you are a run-away, we will protect
you."He bade the men be still and asked if any one was after me.I told
him about the priests, and he replied, "you have come to the right place
for protection, for they dare not show themselves here.I am the leader
of a band of Anti-Catholics, and this is their lodge.You have heard of
us, I presume; we are called Orange men.Our object is, to overthrow the
Roman Catholic religion, and we are bound by the most fearful oaths to
stand by each other, and protect all who seek our aid.The priests dread
our influence, for we have many members, and I hope ere long, the power
of the Pope in this country will be at an end.I am sure people must see
what a cruel, hypocritical set they are."Before he had done speaking, a man came to the door and said, "The
carriage is ready."Another of the men, on hearing this, said, "Come
with me, and I'll take you out of the reach of the priests."He
conducted me to a carriage, which was covered and the curtains all
fastened down.He helped me into it, directing me to sit upon the back
seat, where I could not be seen by any one unless they took particular
pains.Oars that night, and, if I remember right,
he said the distance was twelve miles.When, he left me he gave me
twenty-five cents.I travelled all night, and about midnight passed
through St.Dennis, But I did not stop until the next morning, when I
called at a house and asked for something to eat.The lady gave me some
bread and milk, and I again pursued my way.Once more I had the good fortune to obtain a passage across the river in
a ferry-boat, and was soon pressing onward upon the other side.John's, I followed the
railroad to a village which I was informed was called Stotsville,
[Footnote: I beg leave once more to remind the reader that it is by
no means certain that I give these names correctly.Hearing them
pronounced, with no idea of ever referring to them again, it is not
strange that mistakes of this kind should occur.]a great part of the
property being owned by a Mr.Stots, to whom I was at once directed.Here I stopped, and was kindly received by the gentleman and his wife.They offered me refreshments, gave me some articles of clothing, and
then he carried me twelve miles, and left me at Rouse's Point, to take
the cars for Albany.He gave me six dollars to pay my expenses, and a
letter of introduction to a gentleman by the name of Williams, in which
he stated all the facts he knew concerning me, and commended me to his
care for protection.Williams lived on North
Pearl street, but I may be mistaken in this and also in some other
particulars.As I had no thought of relating these facts at the time of
their occurrence, I did not fix them in my mind as I otherwise should
have done.Stots said that if I could not find the gentleman to whom the letter
was directed, I was to take it to the city authorities, and they would
protect me.As he assisted me from the carriage he said, "You will stop
here until the cars come along, and you must get your own ticket.I
shall not notice you again, and I do not wish you to speak to me."I
entered the depot intending to follow his directions; but when I found
the cars would not come along for three hours, I did not dare to stay.There was quite a large collection of people there, and I feared that
some one would suspect and stop me.I therefore resolved to follow the
railroad, and walk on to the next station.On my way I passed over a
railroad bridge, which I should think was two miles long.The wind blew
very hard at the time, and I found it exceedingly difficult to walk
upon the narrow timbers.More than once I came near losing my precarious
footing, and I was in constant fear that the train would overtake me
before I got over.In that case I had resolved to step outside the track
where I thought I could stand upon the edge of the bridge and hold on
by the telegraph poles, and thus let them pass without doing me injury.Happily, however, I was not compelled to resort to this perilous
expedient, but passed the bridge in safety.At the end I found another
nearly as long, connected with it by a drawbridge.When I drew near it
was up for a boat to pass; but a man called to me, and asked if I
wish to go over.I told him I did, and he let down the bridge.As I
approached him he asked, "Are you mad?I told
him I had walked from the depot at Rouse's Point.He appeared greatly
surprised, and said, "You are the first person who ever walked over
that bridge.Will you come to my house and rest awhile?You must be very
weary, and my wife will be glad to see you.She is rather lonely
here, and is pleased to see any one.'Tis only a short
distance, just down under the bridge."I
thanked him, but firmly refused to go one step out of my way.I thought
that he wished to deceive me, perhaps take me to some out-of-the-way
place, and give me up to my pursuers.At all events, it was wise not to
trust him, for I was sure there was no house near the bridge, certainly
not under it.I have since learned that such is the fact.As I turned to
leave him, he again urged me to stop, and said, "The cars will soon be
along, and they will run over you.How do you expect to get out of their
way?"I told him I would risk it, and left him.I passed on in safety,
and soon came to the depot, where I took the evening train for Albany.At eight the same evening I left the cars, and walked on towards Troy,
which I think was four miles distant.Here I met a lad, of whom I
inquired the way to Albany."You cannot get there to-night," said he,
"and I advise you not to try."When he saw that I was determined to go
on, he said I would pass a tavern called the half-way house, and if I
was tired I could stop there.It was about eleven o'clock when I passed
this house, There were several persons on the piazza, laughing, talking,
and singing, who called me as I passed, shouted after me, and bade me
stop.Exceedingly frightened, I ran with all possible speed, but they
continued to call after me till I was out of hearing.Seeing a light
at a house near by, I ventured to rap on the door.It was opened by a
woman, who asked me to walk in.She
informed me, but said, "You can't go there to-night."I told her I must,
"Well," said she, "if you will go, the watch will take care of you when
you get there."She then asked, "Were those men calling after you?"I
told her I supposed they were, when she replied, with a peculiar smile,
"I guess you can't be a very nice kind of girl, or you wouldn't be on
the street this time of night."My feelings were so deeply wounded I
could hardly restrain my tears at this cruel insinuation; but pride came
to my aid, and, choking down the rising emotion, I replied as carelessly
as possible, "I must do as I can, and not as I would."It was about one o'clock at night when I entered the principal street in
Albany, and, as the lady predicted, a watchman came to me and asked why
I was out that time of night.He stood
beside a lamp-post and read it, when he seemed satisfied, and said, "I
know the man; come with me and I'll take you to his house."I followed
him a long way, till at last he stopped before a large house, and rang
the bell.Williams came to the door, and asked what was wanted.He read it, and invited me to stop.His
wife got up, received me very kindly, and gave me some supper, for
which I was truly grateful.Nor was I less thankful for the delicate
consideration with which they avoided any allusion to my convent life,
or my subsequent flight and suffering.Williams saw that I was sad
and weary, and as she conducted me to a comfortable bed, she remarked,
"You are safe at last, and I am glad of it.You can now retire without
the apprehension of danger, and sleep in perfect security.You are with
friends who will protect you as long as you choose to remain with us."Notwithstanding the good lady's assurance of safety, I found it
impossible to close my eyes.I was among strangers, in a strange place,
and, having been so often deceived, might I not be again?Perhaps, after
all their pretended kindness, they were plotting to betray me.A few
days, however, convinced me that I had at last found real friends, who
would protect me in the hour of danger to the utmost of their ability.I remained here some four weeks, and should have remained longer, but an
incident transpired that awakened all my fears, and again sent me forth
into the wide world, a fugitive, and a wanderer.I went to my chamber
one night, when I heard a sound like the full, heavy respiration of a
man in deep sleep.The sound appeared to come from under the bed, but
stopped as I entered the room.I was very much alarmed, but I controlled
my feelings, and instead of running shrieking from the room, I
deliberately closed the blinds, shut the windows, adjusted the curtain,
all the time carelessly humming a tune, and taking up my lamp I
slowly left the room.Once outside the door, I ran in all haste to Mr.Williams, and told him what I had heard.He laughed at me, said it was
all imagination, but, to quiet my fears, he went to my room resolved
to convince me that no one was there.I followed, and stood at the door
while he lifted the bed valance, when a large, tall man sprang forth,
and caught him with one hand while with the other he drew a pistol
from beneath his coat saying, "Let me go, and I'll depart in peace; but
attempt to detain me, and I'll blow your brains out."Williams came in great terror and consternation, to see what was
the matter.But she could render no assistance, and Mr.Williams, being
unarmed, was obliged to let him go.The watch were immediately called,
and they sought for the intruder in every direction.No effort was
spared to find him, that we might, at least, learn the object of
this untimely visit.No trace of his
whereabouts could be discovered.Williams said he did not believe it was me he sought.He thought the
object was robbery, and perhaps arson and murder, but he would not
think that I was in the least danger."The man," he said, "in hastily
concealing himself had taken the first hiding place he could find."Indeed, so sure was I that he was an agent of the
priests, sent forth for the express purpose of arresting me, no earthly
consideration would have induced me to remain there another day.The
rest of that night I spent in a state of anxiety I cannot describe.I dared not even undress and go to bed, but I
sat in my chair, or walked the room every moment expecting the return
of the mysterious visitor.I shuddered at every sound, whether real or
imaginary.Once in particular, I remember, the distant roll of carriage
wheels fell upon my ear.I listened; it came near, and still nearer,
till at last it stopped, as I thought, at the gate.For a moment I stood
literally stupified with terror, and then I hastily prepared to use the
means for self destruction I had already provided in anticipation of
such an emergency.I was still resolved never to be taken alive."Give
me liberty or give me death," was now the language of my soul.If I
could not enjoy the one, I would cordially embrace the other.But it was
a sad alternative after all I had suffered that I might be free, after
all my buoyant hopes, all my ardent aspirations for a better life.O, it
was a bitter thing, thus to stand in the darkness of night, and with my
own hand carefully adjust the cord that was to cut me off from the land
of the living, and in a moment launch my trembling soul into the vast,
unknown, untried, and fearful future, that men call eternity!Was this
to be the only use I was to make of liberty?Was it for this I had so
long struggled, toiled, wept and prayed?"God of mercy," I cried, "save,
O save me from this last great sin!From the sad and dire necessity
which thus urges me to cut short a life which thou alone canst give!"My prayer was heard; but how slowly passed the hours of that weary night
while I waited for the day that I might "hasten my escape from the windy
storm and tempest."Truly, at that time I could say with one of old,
"Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed
me.My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me.Oh that I had the wings of a dove, for then would I flee
away, and be at rest."I had not the wings of a dove, and whither should I flee from
the furious grasp of my relentless persecutors?Again I must go forth
into the "busy haunts of men," I must mingle with the multitude, and
what chance had I for ultimate escape?If I left these kind friends, and
leave them I must, who would take me in?Who
would have the power to rescue me in my hour of need?In God alone could
I trust, yet why is he so far from helping me?And why does he thus allow the wicked to triumph; to
lay snares for the feet of the innocent, and wrongfully persecute those
whom their wanton cruelty hath caused to sit in darkness and in the
shadow of death?Why does he not at once "break the bands of iron, and
let the oppressed go free?"Williams in the
morning, I told him I could no longer remain with him, for I was sure
if I did, I should be suddenly arrested in some unguarded moment, and
carried back to Montreal.He urged me to stay, assured me he would never
allow them to take me, said that he thought some of going south, and I
could go with him, and thus be removed far from all whom I feared.Williams, also, strove to persuade me to stay.But, though sorry to
appear ungrateful, I dared not remain another night where I felt that my
danger was so great.When they found that I was determined to go, Mr.Williams said I
had better go to Worcester, Mass., and try to get employment in some
farmer's family, a little out of the city.He gave me money to bear my
expenses, until I found a place where I could earn my living.It was
with a sad heart that I left this hospitable roof, and as I turned away
I said in my heart, "Shall I always be hunted through the world in this
manner, obliged to flee like a guilty thing, and shall I never find
a home of happiness and peace?Must sorrow and despair forever be the
portion of my cup?"But no words of mine can describe what I felt at
that moment.I longed for the power to sound a warning through the
length and breadth of the land, to cry in the ears of all the people,
"Beware of Romanism!"Like the patient man of Uz, with whose history
I have since become familiar, I was ready to exclaim, "O that my words
were now written!Graven with an
iron pen," that the whole world might know what a fearful and bitter
thing it is to be a nun!To be subject to the control of those ruthless
tyrants, the Romish Priests.Once more I entered the depot, and mingled with the crowd around the
ticket office.But no pen can describe my terror when I found myself the
object of particular attention.I heard people remark about my strange
and unnatural appearance, and I feared I might be taken up for a crazy
person, if not for a nun.Thinking that I saw an enemy in every face,
and a pursuer in every one who came near me, I hastened to take refuge
in the cars.There I waited with the greatest impatience for the
starting of the train.Slowly the cars were filled; very leisurely the
passengers sought their seats, while I sat trembling in every limb, and
the cold perspiration starting from every pore.how eagerly I watched for some indication of the priest or
the spy!So intense was my anxiety, those few moments seemed to me an
age of agony.At length the shrill whistle announced that all was ready,
and like sweetest music the sound fell upon my ears.The train dashed
off at lightning speed, but to me it seemed like the movement of a
snail.Once under way, I ventured to breathe freely, and hope again revived.But even as the thought passed my mind, a
man entered the cars and seated himself directly, before me.I thought
he regarded me with too much interest, and thinking to shun him, I
quietly left my seat and retired to the other end of the car.He soon
followed, and again my fears revived.He at first tried to converse with
me, but finding I would not reply, he began to question me in the most
direct and impertinent manner.Again I changed my seat, and again he
followed.I then sought the conductor, and revealed to him enough of my
history to enlist his sympathy and ensure his protection.To his honor
be it spoken, I did not appeal to him in vain.He severely reproved the
man for his impertinence; and for the rest of the journey I was shielded
from insult or injury.Nothing further of interest transpired until I reached Worcester, when
the first face that met my eye as I was about to leave the cars was that
of a Romish priest.I could not be mistaken, for I had often seen him
at Montreal.He might not have been looking for me, but he watched every
passenger as they left the cars in a way that convinced me he had some
special reason for doing it.As I, too, had special reasons for avoiding
him just at that time, I stepped back out of sight until the passengers
were all out of the cars and the priest had turned away.I then sprang
out upon the opposite side, and, turning my back upon the depot,
hastened away amid the wilderness of houses, not knowing whither I went.For a long time I wandered around, until at length, being faint and
weary, I began to look for some place where I could obtain refreshment.But when I found a restaurant I did not dare to enter.A number of
Irishmen were standing around who were in all probability Catholics.I
would not venture among them; but as I turned aside I remembered that
Mr.Williams had directed me to seek employment a little out of the
city.I then inquired the way to Main street, and having found it, I
turned to the north and walked on till I found myself out of the thickly
settled part of the city.Then I began to seek for employment, and after
several fruitless applications I chanced to call upon a man whose name
was Handy.He received me in the kindest manner, and when I asked for
work, he said his wife did not need to hire me, but I was welcome to
stop with them and work for my board until I found employment elsewhere.This offer I joyfully accepted; and, as I became acquainted in the
place, many kind hands were extended to aid me in my efforts to obtain
an honest living.In this neighborhood I still reside, truly thankful
for past deliverance, grateful for present mercies, and confidently
trusting God for the future.Here closes the history of Sarah J. Richardson, as related by herself.The remaining particulars have been obtained from her employers in
Worcester.She arrived in this city August, 1854, and, as she has already stated,
at once commenced seeking for employment.She called at many houses
before she found any one who wished for help; and her first question
at each place was, "Are you a Catholic?"If the answer was in the
affirmative, she passed on, but if the family were Protestants, she
inquired for some kind of employment.She did not care what it was; she
would cook, wash, sew, or do chamber-work--anything to earn her bread.Handy was the first person who took her in, and gave her a home.In his family she worked for her board a few weeks, going out to wash
occasionally as she had opportunity.She then went to Holden Mass., but
for some reason remained only one week, and again returned to Worcester.Ezra Goddard then took her into his own family, and found her
capable, industrious, and trustworthy.Had anything been wanting to
prove her truthfulness and sincerity, the deep gratitude of her fervent
"I thank you," when told that she had found a permanent home, would
have done it effectually.But though her whole appearance indicated
contentment and earnestness of purpose, though her various duties
were faithfully and zealously performed, yet the deep sadness of her
countenance, and the evident anxiety of her mind at first awakened a
suspicion of mental derangement.She seemed restless, suspicious,
and morbidly apprehensive of approaching danger.The appearance of a
stranger, or a sudden ringing of the bell, would cause her to start,
tremble, and exhibit the greatest perturbation of spirit.In fact, she
seemed so constantly on the qui vive, the lady of the house one day said
to her, "Sarah, what is the matter with you?"The
Roman Catholic priests," she replied.I ran away
from the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, and twice I have been caught, carried
back, and punished in the most cruel manner.O, if you knew what I have
suffered, you would not wonder that I live in constant fear lest they
again seek out my retreat; and I will die before I go back again."Further questioning drew from her the foregoing narrative, which she
repeated once and again to various persons, and at different times,
without the least alteration or contradiction.Goddard some weeks, when she was taken into the employ of Mr.This gentleman informs us that he found her a faithful, industrious,
honest servant, and he has not the least doubt of the truthfulness of
her statements respecting her former life in the Convent.A few weeks after this, she was married to Frederick S. Richardson
with whom she became acquainted soon after her arrival in the city of
Worcester.The marriage ceremony was performed by Charles Chaffin, Esq.,
of Holden, Mass.After their marriage, her husband hired a room in the
house occupied by Mr.After a
few weeks, however, they removed to a place called the Drury farm.It is
owned by the heirs, but left in the care of Mr.Richardson had often been advised
to allow her history to be placed before the public.But she always
replied, "For my life I would not do it.Not because I do not wish the
world to know it, for I would gladly proclaim it wherever a Romanist is
known, but it would be impossible for me to escape their hands should
I make myself so public.After
her marriage, however, her principal objection was removed.She thought
they would not wish to take her back into the nunnery, and her husband
would protect her from violence.She therefore related the story of her
life while in the convent, which, in accordance with her own request,
was written down from her lips as she related it.Lucy Ann Hood, wife of Edward P. Hood, and daughter of Ezra Goddard.It
is now given to the public without addition or alteration, and with
but a slight abridgment.A strange and startling story it certainly
is.Perhaps the reader will cast it aside at once as a worthless
fiction,--the idle vagary of an excited brain.The compiler, of course,
cannot vouch for its truth, but would respectfully invite the attention
of the reader to the following testimonials presented by those who have
known the narrator.The first is from Edward P. Hood, with whom Mrs.Richardson resided when her narrative was written.(TESTIMONY OF EDWARD P.I hereby certify that I was personally
acquainted with Sarah J. Richards, now Sarah J. Richardson, at the time
she resided in Worcester, Mass.I first saw her at the house of Mr.Ezra
Goddard, where she came seeking employment.She appeared anxious to get
some kind of work, was willing to do anything to earn an honest living.She had the appearance of a person who had seen much suffering and
hardship.Goddard a short time, when she obtained
another place.She then left, but called very often; and during her stay
in Worcester, she worked there several times.So far as I was able to
judge of her character, I do not hesitate to say that she was a woman
of truth and honesty.I heard her relate the account of her life and
sufferings in the Grey Nunnery, and her final escape.I knew when the
story was written, and can testify to its being done according to her
own dictation.I have examined the manuscript, and can say that it a
written out truly and faithfully as related by the nun herself.Worcester, May 5, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EZRA GODDARD.)I first became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson in August 1854.She
came to my house to work for my wife.She was at my house a great many
times after that until March 1855, when she left Worcester.At one time
she was there four or five weeks in succession.She was industrious,
willing to do anything to get an honest living.She was kind in her
disposition, and honest in her dealings.I have no hesitation in saying
that I think her statements can be relied upon.(TESTIMONY OF LUCY GODDARD.)I am acquainted with the above named Sarah J. Richardson, and can fully
testify to the truth of the above statements as to her kindness and
industrious habits, honesty and truthfulness.(TESTIMONY OF JOSIAH GODDARD.)To whom it may concern: This is to testify that I am acquainted with
Sarah J. Richardson, formerly Sarah J. Richards.I became acquainted
with her in the fall of 1854.She worked at my father's at the time.I
heard her tell her story, and from what I saw of her while she was in
Worcester, I have no hesitation in saying that she was a woman of truth
and honesty.Worcester, March 1, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EBEN JEWETT.)I became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson last winter, at the house
of Mr.Ezra Goddard; saw her a number of times after that, at the place
where I boarded.She did some work for my wife, and I heard her speak
of being at the Grey Nunnery.I have no doubt of her being honest and truthful, and I believe
she is so considered by all who became acquainted with her.(TESTIMONY OF CHARLES CHAFFIN.)Worcester, ss.--Holden, Nov.This certifies that I this day united in marriage, Frederick S.
Richardson and Sarah J. Richards, both of Worcester.CHARLES CHAFFIN, Justice of the Peace.I, Sarah J. Richardson, wife of Frederick S. Richardson, of the city
of Worcester, County of Worcester, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
formerly Sarah J. Richards before marriage, do solemnly swear, declare
and say, that the foregoing pages contain a true and faithful history of
my life before my marriage to the said Frederick S. Richardson, and
that every statement made herein by me is true.In witness whereof, I do
hereunto set my hand and seal, this 13th day of March, A.D.SARAH J. RICHARDSON (X her mark.)Sworn to before me, the 13th day of March, AD.(TESTIMONY OF Z. K.When it was known that the Narrative of Sarah J. Richardson was about to
be published, Mr.Z. K. Pangborn, at that time editor of the Worcester
Daily Transcript, voluntarily offered the following testimony which we
copy from one of his editorials."We have no doubt that the nun here spoken of as one who escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, is the same person who spent some weeks in
our family in the fall of 1853, after her first escape from the Nunnery.She came in search of employment to our house in St.Albans, Vt.,
stating that she had traveled on foot from Montreal, and her appearance
indicated that she was poor, and had seen hardship.She obtained work
at sewing, her health not being sufficient for more arduous task.She
appeared to be suffering under some severe mental trial, and though
industrious and lady-like in her deportment, still appeared absent
minded, and occasionally singular in her manner.After awhile she
revealed the fact to the lady of the house, that she had escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, but begged her not to inform any one
of the fact, as she feared, if it should be known, that she would be
retaken, and carried back.A few days after making this disclosure,
she suddenly disappeared.Having gone out one evening, and failing to
return, much inquiry was made, but no trace of her was obtained for some
months.called on us to
make inquiries in regard to this same person and gave us the following
account of her as given by herself.She states that on the evening when
she so mysteriously disappeared from our house, she called upon an Irish
family whose acquaintance she had formed, and when she was coming away,
was suddenly seized, gagged, and thrust into a close carriage, or box,
as she thought, and on the evening of the next day found herself once
more consigned to the tender mercies of the Grey Nunnery in Montreal.Her capture was effected by a priest who tracked her to St.Albans,
and watched his opportunity to seize her.She was subjected to the most
rigorous and cruel treatment, to punish her for running away, and kept
in close confinement till she feigned penitence and submission, when she
was treated less cruelly, and allowed more liberty."But the difficulties in the way of an escape, only stimulated her the
more to make the attempt, and she finally succeeded a second time in
getting out of that place which she described as a den of cruelty and
misery.She was successful also in eluding her pursuers, and in reaching
this city, (Worcester,) where she remained some time, seeking to avoid
notoriety, as she feared she might be again betrayed and captured.She
is now, however, in a position where she does not fear the priests, and
proposes to give to the world a history of her life in the Nunnery.The
disclosures she makes are of the most startling character, but of her
veracity and good character we have the most satisfactory evidence."Pangborn, a sister of the late Mrs
Branard, the lady with whom Sarah J. Richardson stopped in St.Albans,
and by whom she was employed as a seamstress.Being an inmate of the
family at the time, Mrs Pangborn states that she had every opportunity
to become acquainted with the girl and learn her true character.The
family, she says, were all interested in her, although they knew nothing
of her secret, until a few days before she left.She speaks of her as
being "quiet and thoughtful, diligent, faithful and anxious to please,
but manifesting an eager desire for learning, that she might be able to
acquaint herself more perfectly with the Holy Scriptures.She could,
at that time, read a little, and her mind was well stored with select
passages from the sacred volume, which she seemed to take great delight
in repeating.She was able to converse intelligently upon almost
any subject, and never seemed at a loss for language to express her
thoughts.No one could doubt that nature had given her a mind capable of
a high degree of religious and intellectual culture, and that, with
the opportunity for improvement, she would become a useful member of
society.Of book knowledge she was certainly quite ignorant, but she had
evidently studied human nature to some good purpose."Mrs Pangborn also
corroborates many of the statements in her narrative.She often visited
the Grey Nunnery, and says that the description given of the building,
the Academy, the Orphan's Home, and young ladies school, are all
correct.The young Smalley mentioned in the narrative was well known to
her, and also his sister "little Sissy Smalley," as they used to call
her.Inquiries have been made of those acquainted with the route along
which the fugitive passed in her hasty flight, and we are told that the
description is in general correct; that even the mistakes serve to prove
the truthfulness of the narrator, being such as a person would be likely
to make when describing from memory scenes and places they had seen but
once; whereas, if they were getting up a fiction which they designed to
represent as truth, such mistakes would be carefully avoided.APPENDIX I.

ABSURDITIES OF ROMANISTS.It may perchance be thought by some persons that the foregoing narrative
contains many things too absurd and childish for belief."What rational
man," it may be said, "would ever think of dressing up a figure to
represent the devil, for the purpose of frightening young girls into
obedience?Surely no sane man, and certainly
no Christian teacher, would ever stoop to such senseless mummery!"Incredible it may seem--foolish, false, inconsistent with reason, or the
plain dictates of common sense, it certainly is--but we have before us
well-authenticated accounts of transactions in which the Romish priests
claimed powers quite as extraordinary, and palmed off upon a credulous,
superstitious people stories quite as silly and ridiculous as anything
recorded in these pages.Indeed, so barefaced and shameless were their
pretensions in some instances, that even their better-informed brethren
were ashamed of their folly, and their own archbishop publicly rebuked
their dishonesty, cupidity and chicanery.In proof of this we place
before our readers the following facts which we find in a letter from
Professor Similien, of the college of Angers, addressed to the Union de
l'Ouest:

"Some years ago a pretended miracle was reported as having occurred upon
a mountain called La Salette, in the southeastern part of France,
where the Virgin Mary appeared in a very miraculous manner to two young
shepherds.The story, however, was soon proved to be a despicable trick
of the priest, and as such was publicly exposed.But the Bishop of
Lucon, within whose diocese the sacred mountain stands, appears to have
been unwilling to relinquish the advantage which he expected to result
from a wide-spread belief in this infamous fable.Accordingly, in
July, 1852, it was again reported that no less than three miracles were
wrought there by the Holy Virgin.The details were as follows:

"A young pupil at the religious establishment of the visitation of
Valence, who had been for three months completely blind from an attack
of gutta-serena, arrived at La Salette on the first of July, in company
with some sisters of the community.The extreme fatigue which she had
undergone in order to reach the summit of the mountain, at the place of
the apparition, caused some anxiety to be felt that she could not remain
fasting until the conclusion of the mass, which had not yet commenced,
and the Abbe Sibilla, one of the missionaries of La Salette, was
requested to administer the sacrament to her before the service began.She had scarcely received the sacred wafer, when, impelled by a sudden
inspiration, she raised her head and exclaimed,'ma bonne mere, je vous
vois.'She had, in fact, her eyes fixed on the statue of the Virgin,
which she saw as clearly as any one present For more than an hour she
remained plunged in an ecstasy of gratitude and love, and afterward
retired from the place without requiring the assistance of those who
accompanied her.At the same moment a woman from Gap, nearly sixty years
of age, who for the last nineteen years had not had the use of her right
arm, in consequence of a dislocation, suddenly felt it restored to
its original state, and swinging round the once paralyzed limb, she
exclaimed, in a transport of joy and gratitude, 'And I also am cured!'A third cure, although not instantaneous, is not the less striking.Another woman, known in the country for years as being paralytic, could
not ascend the mountain but with the greatest difficulty, and with the
aid of crutches.On the first day of the neuvane, that of her arrival,
she felt a sensation as if life was coming into her legs, which had been
for so long time dead.This feeling went on increasing, and the last day
of the neuvane, after having received the communion, she went, without
any assistance, to the cross of the assumption, where she hung up her
crutches."Bishop Lucon must have known that this was mere imposition; yet, so far
from exposing a fraud so base, he not only permits his people to believe
it, but he lends his whole influence to support and circulate the
falsehood.a church was to be erected; and it was necessary
to get up a little enthusiasm among the people in order to induce them
to fill his exhausted coffers, and build the church.In proof of this,
we have only to quote a few extracts from the 'Pastoral' which he issued
on this occasion."'And now," he says, "Mary has deigned to appear on the summit of a
lofty mountain to two young shepherds, revealing to them the secrets
of heaven.But who attests the truth of the narrative of these Alpine
pastors?No other than the men themselves, and they are believed.They
declare what they have seen, they repeat what they have heard, they
retain what they have received commandment to keep secret."A few words of the incomparable Mother of God have transformed them
into new men.Incapable of concerting aught between themselves, or of
imagining anything similar to what they relate, each is the witness to a
vision which has not found him unbelieving; each is its historian.These
two shepherds, dull as they were, have at once understood and received
the lesson which was vouchsafed to them, and it is ineffaceably engraven
on their hearts.They add nothing to it, they take nothing from it, they
modify it in nowise, they deliver the oracle of Heaven just as they have
received it."An admirable constancy enabled them to guard the secret, a singular
sagacity made them discern all the snares laid for them, a rare prudence
suggested to them a thousand responses, not one of which betrayed their
secret; and when at length the time came when it was their duty to make
it known to the common Father of the Faithful, they wrote correctly, as
if reading a book placed under their eyes.Their recital drew to this
blessed mountain thousands of pilgrims."They proclaimed that 'on Saturday, the 19th of September, 1846, Mary
manifested herself to them; and the anniversary of this glorious day is
henceforth and forever dear to Christian piety.Will not every pilgrim
who repairs to this holy mountain add his testimony to the truthfulness
of these young shepherds?Mary halted near a fountain; she communicated
to it a celestial virtue, a divine efficacy.From being intermittent,
this spring, today so celebrated, became perennial."'Every where is recounted the prodigies which she works.When the
afflicted are in despair, the infirm without remedy, they resort to the
waters of La Salette, and cures are wrought by this remedy, whose power
makes itself felt against every evil.Our diocess, so devoted to Mary,
has been no stranger to the bounty of this tender Mother.We are
about to celebrate shortly the sixth anniversary of this miraculous
apparition.NOW THAT A SANCTUARY IS TO BE RAISED on this holy mountain
to the glory of God, we have thought it right to inform you thereof."'We cannot doubt that many of you have been heard by our Lady of
La Salette; you desire to witness your gratitude to this mother of
compassion; you would gladly BRING YOUR STONE to the beautiful edifice
that is to be constructed.WE DESIRE TO FURTHER YOUR FILIAL TENDERNESS
WITH THE MEANS OF TRANSMITTING THE ALMS OF FAITH AND PIETY.For these
reasons, invoking the holy name of God, we have ordained and do ordain
as follows, viz.:

"'First, we permit the appearance of our Lady of La Salette to be
preached throughout our diocess; secondly, on Sunday, the 19th of
September next ensuing, the litanies of the Holy Virgin shall be chanted
in all the chapels and churches of the diocess, and be followed by the
benediction of the Holy Sacrament.Thirdly, THE FAITHFUL WHO MAY DESIRE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ERECTION OF THE NEW SANCTUARY, MAY DEPOSIT THEIR
OFFERINGS IN THE HANDS OF THE CURE, WHO WILL TRANSMIT THEM TO US FOR THE
BISHOP OF GRENOBLE."'Our present pastoral letter shall be read and published after mass in
every parish on the Sunday after its reception."'Given at Lucon, in our Episcopal palace, under our sign-manual and the
seal of our arms, and the official counter-signature of our secretary,
the 30th of June, of the year of Grace, 1852."'X Jac-Mar Jos, "'Bishop of Lucon.'""It is not a little remarkable," says the editor of the American
Christian Union, "that whilst the Bishop of Lucon was engaged in
extolling the miracles of La Salette, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons,
Dr.Bonald, 'Primate of all the Gauls,' addressed a circular to all the
priests in his diocese, in which he cautions them against apocryphal
miracles!There is indubitable evidence that his grace refers to the
scandalous delusions of La Salette.He attributes the miracles in question to pecuniary speculation, which
now-a-days, he says, mingles with everything, seizes upon imaginary
facts, and profits by it at the expense of the credulous!He charges the
authors of these things with being GREEDY MEN, who aim at procuring for
themselves DISHONEST GAINS by this traffic in superstitious objects!And
he forbids the publishing from the pulpit, without leave, of any account
of a miracle, even though its authenticity should be attested by another
Bishop!His grace deserves credit for setting his face
against this miserable business, of palming off false miracles upon the
people."[Footnote: Since the above was written, we have met with the following
explanation of this modern miracle:

"A few years ago there was a great stir among 'the simple faithful' in
France, occasioned by a well-credited apparition of the Holy Virgin at
La Salette.She required the erection of a chapel in her honor at that
place, and made such promises of special indulgences to all who paid
their devotions there, that it became 'all the rage' as a place of
pilgrimage.The consequence was, that other shops for the same sort of
wares in that region lost most of their customers, and the good priests
who tended the tills were sorely impoverished.In self-defence, they,
WELL KNOWING HOW SUCH THINGS WERE GOT UP, exposed the trick.A prelate
publicly denounced the imposture, and an Abbe Deleon, priest in the
diocess of Grenoble, printed a work called 'La Salette a Valley of
Lies.'In this publication it was maintained, with proofs, that the hoax
was gotten up by a Mademoiselle de Lamerliere, a sort of half-crazy nun,
who impersonated the character of the Virgin.For the injury done to her
character by this book she sued the priest for damages to the tone of
twenty thousand francs, demanding also the infliction of the utmost
penalty of the law.The court, after a long and careful investigation,
for two days, as we learn by the Catholic Herald, disposed of the case
by declaring the miracle-working damsel non-suited, and condemning her
to pay the expenses of the prosecution."Another of Rome's marvellous stories we copy from the New York Daily
Times of July 3d, 1854.It is from the pen of a correspondent at Rome,
who, after giving an account of the ceremony performed in the church
of St.Peters at the canonization of a NEW SAINT, under the name of
Germana, relates the following particulars of her history.He says, "I
take the facts as they are related in a pamphlet account of her 'life,
virtues, and miracles,' published by authority at Rome:

"Germana Consin was born near the village of Pibrac, in the diocess
of Toulouse, in France.Maimed in one hand, and of a scrofulous
constitution, she excited the hatred of her step-mother, in whose power
her father's second marriage placed her while yet a child.This cruel
woman gave the little Germana no other bed than some vine twigs, lying
under a flight of stairs, which galled her limbs, wearied with the day's
labor.She also persuaded her husband to send the little girl to tend
sheep in the plains, exposed to all extremes of weather.Injuries and
abuse were her only welcome when she returned from her day's task to
her home.To these injuries she submitted with Christian meekness and
patience, and she derived her happiness and consolation from religious
faith.She went every day to church to hear mass, disregarding the
distance, the difficulty of the journey, and the danger in which she
left her flock.The neighboring forest was full of wolves, who devoured
great numbers from other flocks, but never touched a sheep in that of
Germana.To go to the church she was obliged to cross a little river,
which was often flooded, but she passed with dry feet; the waters
flowing away from her on either side: howbeit no one else dared to
attempt the passage.Whenever the signal sounded for the Ave Marie,
wherever she might be in conducting her sheep, even if in a ditch, or in
mud or mire, she kneeled down and offered her devotions to the Queen of
Heaven, nor were her garments wet or soiled.The little children whom
she met in the fields she instructed in the truths of religion.For the
poor she felt the tenderest charity, and robbed herself of her scanty
pittance of bread to feed them.One day her step-mother, suspecting
that she was carrying away from the house morsels of bread to be thus
distributed, incited her husband to look in her apron; he did so, BUT
FOUND IT FULL OF FLOWERS, BEAUTIFUL BUT OUT OF SEASON, INSTEAD OF BREAD.This miraculous conversion of bread into flowers formed the subject
of one of the paintings exhibited in St.Industrious, charitable, patient and forgiving, Germana lived a
memorable example of piety till she passed from earth in the twenty
second year of her age.The night of her death two holy monks were
passing, on a journey, in the neighborhood of her house.Late at night
they saw two celestial virgins robed in white on the road that led to
her habitation; a few minutes afterwards they returned leading between
them another virgin clad in pure white, and with a crown of flowers on
her head."Wonders did not cease with her death.Forty years after this event her
body was uncovered, in digging a grave for another person, and found
entirely uncorrupted--nay, the blood flowed from a wound accidentally
made in her face.Great crowds assembled to see the body so miraculously
preserved, and it was carefully re-interred within the church.There it
lay in place until the French Revolution, when it was pulled up and cast
into a ditch and covered with quick lime and water.But even this
failed to injure the body of the blessed saint.It was found two years
afterward entirely unhurt, and even the grave clothes which surrounded
it were entire, as on the day of sepulture, two hundred years before."And now in the middle of the nineteenth century, these facts are
published for the edification of believers, and his Holiness has set his
seal to their authenticity.Four miracles performed by this saint after
her death are attested by the bull of beatification, and also by Latin
inscriptions in great letters displayed at St.Peter's on the day
of this great celebration.The monks of the monastery at Bourges, in
France, prayed her to intercede on one occasion, that their store of
bread might be multiplied; on another their store of meal; on both
occasions THEIR PRAYER WAS GRANTED.The other two miracles were cures
of desperate maladies, the diseased persons having been brought to pray
over her tomb."On the splendid scarlet hangings, bearing the arms of Pius IX.and
suspended at the corners of the nave and transept, were two Latin
inscriptions, of similar purport, of one of which I give a translation:
'O Germana, raised to-day to celestial honors by Pius IX.Pontifex
Maximus, since thou knowest that Pius has wept over thy nation wandering
from God, and has exultingly rejoiced at its reconciling itself with God
little by little, he prays thee intimately united with God, do thou, for
thou canst do it, make known his wishes to God, and strengthen them, for
thou art able, with the virtue of thy prayers.'"I have been thus minute in my account of this Beatification, deeming
the facts I state of no little importance and interest, as casting light
upon the character of the Catholicism of the present day, and showing
with what matters the Spiritual and Temporal ruler of Rome is busying
himself in this year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty-four."Many other examples similar to the above might be given from the history
of Catholicism as it exists at the present time in the old world.But
let us turn to our own country.We need not look to France or Rome for
examples of priestly intrigue of the basest kind; and absurdities that
almost surpass belief.The following account which we copy from The
American and Foreign Christian Union of August, 1852, will serve to show
that the priests in these United States are quite as willing to impose
upon the ignorant and credulous as, their brethren in other countries.The article is from the pen of an Irish Missionary in the employ of The
American and Foreign Christian Union and is entitled,

   "A LYING WONDER.""It would seem almost incredible," says the editor of this valuable
Magazine, "that any men could be found in this country who are capable
of practising such wretched deceptions.But the account given in the
subjoined statement is too well authenticated to permit us to reject the
story as untrue, however improbable it may, at first sight, seem to be.Editor,--I give you, herein, some information respecting a lying
wonder wrought in Troy, New York, last winter, and respecting the female
who was the 'MEDIUM' of it.I have come to the conclusion that this
female is a Jesuit, after as good an examination as I have been able to
give the matter.I have been fed with these lying wonders in early life,
and in Ireland as well as in this country there are many who, for want
of knowing any better, will feed upon them in their hearts by faith and
thanksgiving.About the time this lying wonder of which I am about to
write happened, I had been talking of it in the office of Mr.Luther, of
Albany, (coal merchant), where were a number of Irish waiting for a job.One of these men declared, with many curses on his soul if what he told
was not true, that he had seen a devil cast out of a woman in his own
parish, in Ireland, by the priest.I told him it would be better for his
character's sake for him to say he heard of it, than to say he SAW it.J. W. Lockwood, a respectable merchant in Troy, New York, and son of
the late mayor, kept two or three young women as 'helps' for his lady,
last winter.The name of one is Eliza Mead, and the name of another is
Catharine Dillon, a native of the county of Limerick, Ireland.Eliza
was an upper servant, who took care of her mistress and her children.Eliza appeared to her mistress to be
a very well educated, and a very intellectual woman of 35, though she
would try to make believe she could not write, and that she was subject
to fits of insanity.There was then presumptive evidence that she wrote
a good deal, and there is now positive evidence that she could write.She used often, in the presence of Mrs.L., to take the Bible and other
books and read them, and would often say she thought the Protestants
had a better religion than the Catholics, and were a better people.L. that she had doubts about the Catholic
religion, and was inclined toward the Protestant: but now she is
sure, quite sure, that the Catholic alone is the right one, FOR IT WAS
REVEALED TO HER.On the evening of the 23d of December, 1851, Eliza and Catharine were
missing;--but I will give you Catharine's affidavit about their business
from home."I, Catharine Dillon, say, that on Tuesday, 23d December inst, about
five o'clock in the afternoon, I went with Eliza Mead to see the priest,
Mr.Eliza remained there till about six
o'clock P. M. At that time I returned home, leaving her at the priest's.At half past eight o'clock the same evening I returned to the priest's
house for Eliza, and waited there for her till about ten o'clock of the
same evening, expecting that Eliza's conference with the priest would be
ended, and that she would come home with me."During the evening there had been another besides Mr.About ten o'clock this other priest retired, as I understood.McDonnel called me, with others, into the room where Eliza was,
when he said that she (Eliza) was POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL Mr.McDonnel
then commenced interrogating the devil, asking the devil if he possessed
her.and the
answer was, "Six months and nine days."The priest then asked, "Who sent
you into her?""When she was asleep," was the answer.Lockwood had ever tempted Catharine, meaning me, and the reply
was, "Yes."Then the question was, "How many times?"And the answer was,
"Three times, by offering her drink when she was asleep?""I came home about five o'clock in the morning, greatly shocked at
what I had seen and heard, and impressed with the belief that Eliza was
possessed with the devil.I went again to the priest's on Wednesday to
find Eliza, when the priest told me that he, Mr.McDonnel, exorcised the
devil at high mass that morning in the church, and drove the devil out
of Eliza.That he, the devil, came out of Eliza, and spat at the Holy
Cross of Jesus Christ, and departed.He then told me that, as Eliza got
the devil from Mr.Lockwood, in the house where I lived, I must leave
the house immediately, and made me promise him that I would.During the
appalling scenes of Tuesday night, Mr.McDonnel went to the other priest
and called him up, but the other priest did not come to his assistance.These answers to the priest when he was asking questions of the devil,
were given in a very loud voice and sometimes with a loud scream.""Subscribed and sworn to, this 31st day of December, 1851, before me,
JOB S. OLIN, Recorder of Troy, New York."J. W. Lockwood and the Rev.McDonnel,
officiating priest at St.James
M. Warren, T. W. Blatchford, M. D., and C. N. Lockwood, on the part of
Mr.McDonnel, on the evening of the 31st December, 1851.McDonnel at first declined answering any questions, questioning Mr.Lockwood's right to ask them: He would only say that Eliza Mead came to
his house possessed, as she thought, with an evil spirit; that at first
he declined having anything to do with her, first, because he believed
her to be crazy; second, because he was at that moment otherwise
engaged; and thirdly, because she was not in his parish; but, by her
urgent appeals in the name of God to pray over her, he was at last
induced to admit her.He became satisfied that she was possessed of the
devil, or an evil spirit, by saying the appointed prayers of the church
over her; for the spirit manifested uneasiness when this was done; and
furthermore, as she was entering the church the following morning, she
was thrown into convulsions by Father Kenny's making the sign of the
cross behind her back.At high mass in the morning he exorcised the
devil, and he left her, spitting at the cross of Christ before taking
his final departure.McDonnel's repeatedly telling Catharine that she must leave
Mr.L's house immediately, for if she remained there Mr.L. would put
the devil in her, Mr.McDonnel denied saying or doing anything whatever
that was detrimental to the character of Mr.McDonnel repeatedly refused to answer the questions put to him by
Mr.L. should visit his house on
such business, as no power on earth but that of the POPE had authority
to question him on such matters.But being reminded that slanderous
reports had emanated from that very house against Mr.McDonnel, said it was all to see what kind of a man he was that brought
Mr.L. there, and if reports were exaggerated, it was nothing to him.McDonnel said that he cleared the church before casting out the
devil, and there was but one person besides himself there.That,
every word spoken in the church was in Latin, and nobody in the church
understood a word of it.L. had said the pretended answers of the devil ware made
through the medium of ventriloquism.Father Kenny, in the progress of
the interview, made two or three attempts to speak, but was prevented by
Mr.'s brother, who was present,
immediately after the interview.It was all Latin in the church, we
see; but the low Irish will not believe that the devil could understand
Latin.However, it was not all Latin at the priest's house, where
Catharine Dillon heard what she declared on oath.How slow the priest
was to admit her (Eliza Mead) in the beginning, and to believe that she
had his sable majesty in her, until it manifested uneasiness under the
cannonade of church prayers!"But you will ask, how could an educated priest, or an intelligent
woman, condescend to such diabolical impositions?I think it is
something after the way that a man gets to be a drunkard; he may not
like the taste thereof at first, but afterwards he will smack his lips
and say, 'there is nothing like whiskey,' and as their food becomes part
of their bodily substance, so are these 'lying wonders' converted into
their spiritual substance.So I think; I am, however, but a very humble
philosopher, and therefore I will use the diction of the Holy Spirit on
the matter: 'For this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that
they should believe a lie,' EVEN OF THEIR OWN MAKING, OR WHAT MAY EASILY
BE SEEN TO BE LIES OF OTHER'S GETTING, "that they all might be damned
who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.'""ALBANY, June 2nd, 1852."It was said by one "that the first temptation on reading such
monstrosities as the above, is to utter a laugh of derision."But it is
with no such feeling that we place them before our readers.Rather would
we exclaim with the inspired penman, "O that my head were waters and
mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night" for the
deluded followers of these willfully blind leaders!Surely, no pleasure
can be found in reading or recording scenes which a pure mind can regard
only with pity and disgust.Yet we desire to prove to our readers that
the absurd threats and foolish attempts to impose upon the weak and
ignorant recorded by Sarah J. Richardson are perfectly consistent
with the general character and conduct of the Romish priests.Read
for instance, the following ridiculous story translated from Le Semeur
Canadien for October 12th, 1855.In the district of Montreal lived a Canadian widow of French extraction
who had become a Protestant.Madam V--, such was the name of this lady,
lived with her daughter, the sole fruit of a union too soon dissolved
by unsparing death.Their life, full of good works, dispelled prejudices
that the inhabitants of the vicinity--all intolerant Catholics--had
always entertained against evangelical Christians; they gained their
respect, moreover, by presenting them the example of every virtue.Two
of the neighbors of the Protestant widow--who had often heard at her
house the word of God read and commented upon by one of those ministers
who visit the scattered members of their communion--talked lately of
embracing the reformed religion.In the mean while, Miss V-- died.The
young Christian rested her hope upon the promises of the Saviour who has
said, "Believe in Christ and thou shall be saved."Her spirit flew to its Creator with the confidence of an infant who
throws himself into the arms of his father.Her last moments were not
tormented by the fear of purgatory, where every Catholic believes he
will suffer for a longer or shorter time.This death strengthened the
neighbors in the resolution they had taken to leave the Catholic church.The widow buried the remains of her daughter upon her own land, a short
distance from her house: the nearest Protestant cemetery was so far off
that she was forced to give up burying it there.Some Catholic fanatics of the vicinity assembled secretly the day after
the funeral of Miss V-- to discuss the best means for arresting the
progress that the reformed religion was making in the parish.After long
deliberation they resolved to hire a poor man to go every evening for
a whole week and groan near the grave of Miss V---.Their object was to
make the widow and neighbors believe that the young girl was damned; and
that God permitted her to show her great unhappiness by lamentations,
so that they might avoid her fate by remaining faithful to the belief of
their fathers.In any other country than Lower Canada, those who might
have employed such means would not perhaps have had an opportunity
of seeing their enterprise crowned with success; but in our country
districts, where the people believe in ghosts and bugbears, it would
almost certainly produce the desired effect.This expedient, instead of
being ridiculous, was atrocious.The employment of it could not fail to
cause Mrs V-- to suffer the most painful agonies, and her neighbors the
torments of doubt.The credulity of the French-Canadian is the work of the clergy; they
invent and relate, in order to excite their piety, the most marvellous
things.For example: the priests say that souls in purgatory desiring
alleviation come and ask masses of their relatives, either by appearing
in the same form they had in life, or by displacing the furniture and
making a noise, as long as they have not terminated the expiation of
their sins.The Catholic clergy, by supporting these fabulous doctrines
and pious lies, lead their flock into the baleful habit of believing
things the most absurd and destitute of proof.The day after Miss V--'s funeral, everybody in the parish was talking of
the woeful cries which had been heard the night before near her grave.The inhabitants of the place, imbued with fantastic ideas that their
rector had kept alive, were dupes of the artifice employed by some of
their own number.They became convinced that there is no safety outside
of the church, of which they formed a part.Seized with horror they
determined never to pass a night near the grave of the cursed one, as
they already called the young Protestant.V-- by the instinctive
effect of prejudices inculcated when she was a Catholic, was at first a
prey to deadly anxiety; but recalling the holy life of her daughter,
she no longer doubted of her being among the number of the elect.She
guessed at the cause of the noise which was heard near the grave of her
child.In order to assure herself of the justness of her suspicions,
she besought the two neighbors of whom I have already spoken, to conceal
themselves there the following night.These persons were glad of an
occasion to test the accuracy of what a curate of their acquaintance had
told them; who had asserted that a spirit free from the body could yet
manifest itself substantially to the living, as speaking without tongue,
touching without hands.They discovered the man who was paid to play the ghost; they seized him,
and in order to punish him, tied him to a tree, at the foot of which
Miss V-- was buried.The poor creature the next morning no longer acted
the soul in torment, but shouted like a person who very much wanted his
breakfast.At noon one of his friends passed by who, hearing him implore
assistance, approached and set him free.Overwhelmed with questions and
derision, the false ghost confessed he had acted thus only to obtain
the reward which had been promised him.You may easily guess that
the ridicule and reprobation turned upon those who had made him their
instrument.I will not finish this narrative without telling the reader that the
curate of the place appeared much incensed at what his parishioners
had done.I am glad to be able to suppose that he condemns rather
than encourages such conduct.A Protestant friend of mine who does not
entertain the same respect for the Roman clergy that I do, advances the
opinion that the displeasure of the curate was not on account of the
culpable attempt of some of his flock but on account of its failure.However, I must add, on my reputation as a faithful narrator, that
nothing has yet happened to confirm his assertion.ERASTE D'ORSONNENS.CRUELTY OF ROMANISTS.To show that the Romish priests have in all ages, and do still, inflict
upon their victims cruelties quite as severe as anything described in
the foregoing pages, and that such cruelties are sanctioned by their
code of laws, we have only to turn to the authentic history of the past
and present transactions of the high functionaries of Rome.About the year 1356, Nicholas Eymeric, inquisitor-general of Arragon,
collected from the civil and canon laws all that related to the
punishment of heretics, and formed the "Directory of Inquisitors," the
first and indeed the fundamental code, which has been followed ever
since, without any essential variation."It exhibits the practice and
theory of the Inquisition at the time of its sanction by the approbation
of Gregory 13th, in 1587, which theory, under some necessary variations
of practice, still remains unchanged."From this "Directory," transcribed by the Rev.Rule of London, in
1852, we extract a few sentences in relation to torture."Torture is inflicted on one who confesses the principal fact, but
varies as to circumstances.Also on one who is reputed to be a heretic,
but against whom there is only one witness of the fact.In this case
common rumor is one indication of guilt, and the direct evidence is
another, making altogether but semi-plenar proof.Also, when there is no witness, but vehement suspicion.Also when there is no common report of heresy, but only one witness
who has heard or seen something in him contrary to the faith.Any two
indications of heresy will justify the use of torture.If you sentence
to torture, give him a written notice in the form prescribed; but other
means be tried first.Nor is this an infallible means for bringing out
the truth.Weak-hearted men, impatient at the first pain, will confess
crimes they never committed, and criminate others at the same time.Bold
and strong ones will bear the most severe torments.Those who have been
on the rack before bear it with more courage, for they know how to adapt
their limbs to it, and they resist powerfully.Others, by enchantments,
seem to be insensible, and would rather die than confess.These wretches
user for incantations, certain passages from the Psalms of David, or
other parts of Scripture, which they write on virgin parchment in an
extravagant way, mixing them with names of unknown angels, with circles
and strange letters, which they wear upon their person.'I know not,'
says Pena, 'how this witchcraft can be remedied, but it will be well to
strip the criminals naked, and search them narrowly, before laying them
upon the rack.'While the tormentor is getting ready, let the inquisitor
and other grave men make fresh attempts to obtain a confession of the
truth.Let the tormentors TERRIFY HIM BY ALL MEANS, TO FRIGHTEN HIM INTO
CONFESSION.And after he is stripped, let the inquisitor take him aside,
and make a last effort.When this has failed, let him be put to the
question by torture, beginning with interrogation on lesser points,
and advancing to greater.If he stands out, let them show him other
instruments of torture, and threaten that he shall suffer them also.If
he will not confess; the torture may be continued on the second or third
day; but as it is not to be repeated, those successive applications must
be called CONTINUATION.And if, after all, he does not confess, he may
be set at liberty."Rules are laid down for the punishment of those who do confess.commanded the secular judges to put heretics to torture; but that
gave occasion to scandalous publicity, and now inquisitors are empowered
to do it, and, in case of irregularity (THAT IS, IF THE PERSON DIES IN
THEIR HANDS), TO ABSOLVE EACH OTHER.And although nobles were exempt
from torture, and in some kingdoms, as Arragon, it was not used in civil
tribunals, the inquisitors were nevertheless authorized to torture,
without restriction, persons of all classes.And here we digress from Eymeric and Pena, in order to describe, from
additional authority, of what this torture consisted, and probably,
still consists, in Italy.Limborch collects this information from Juan
de Rojas, inquisitor at Valencia."There were five degrees of torment as some counted (Eymeric included),
or according to others, three.First, there was terror, including
the threatenings of the inquisitor, leading to the place of torture,
stripping, and binding; the stripping of their clothing, both men and
women, with the substitution of a single tight garment, to cover part
of the person--being an outrage of every feeling of decency--and the
binding, often as distressing as the torture itself.Secondly came the
stretching on the rack, and questions attendant.Thirdly a more severe
shock, by the tension and sodden relaxation of the cord, which is
sometimes given once, but often twice, thrice, or yet more frequently.""Isaac Orobio, a Jewish physician, related to Limborch the manner in
which he had himself been tortured, when thrown into the inquisition at
Seville, on the delation of a Moorish servant, whom he had punished for
theft, and of another person similarly offended."After having been in the prison of the inquisition for full three
years, examined a few times, but constantly refusing to confess the
things laid to his charge, he was at length brought out of the cell,
and led through tortuous passages to the place of torment.He found himself in a subterranean chamber, rather spacious,
arched over, and hung with black cloth.The whole conclave was lighted
by candles in sconces on the walls.At one end there was a separate
chamber, wherein were an inquisitor and his notary seated at a table.The place, gloomy, intent, and everywhere terrible, seemed to be the
very home of death.Hither he was brought, and the inquisitor again
exhorted him to tell the truth before the torture should begin.On his
answering that he had already told the truth, the inquisitor gravely
protested that he was bringing himself to the torture by his own
obstinacy; and that if he should suffer loss of blood, or even expire,
during the question, the holy office would be blameless.Having thus
spoken, the inquisitor left him in the hands of the tormentors, who
stripped him, and compressed his body so tightly in a pair of linen
drawers, that he could no longer draw breath, and must have died, had
they not suddenly relaxed the pressure; but with recovered breathing
came pain unutterably exquisite.The anguish being past, they repeated a
monition to confess the truth, before the torture, as they said, should
begin; and the same was afterwards repeated at each interval."As Orobio persisted in denial, they bound his thumbs so tightly with
small cords that the blood burst from under the nails, and they were
swelled excessively.Then they made him stand against the wall on
a small stool, passed cords around various parts of his body, but
principally around the arms and legs, and carried them over iron
pulleys in the ceiling.The tormentor then pulled the cords with all his
strength, applying his feet to the wall, and giving the weight of his
body to increase the purchase.With these ligatures his arms and legs,
fingers and toes, were so wrung and swollen that he felt as if fire were
devouring them.In the midst of this torment the man kicked down the
stool which had supported his feet, so that he hung upon the cords
with his whole weight, which suddenly increased their tension, and
gave indescribable aggravation to his pain.An instrument resembling a small ladder, consisting of two
parallel pieces of wood, and five transverse pieces, with the anterior
edges sharpened, was placed before him, so that when the tormentor
struck it heavily, he received the stroke five times multiplied on each
shin bone, producing pain that was absolutely intolerable, and under
which he fainted.But no sooner was he revived than they inflicted a new
torture.The tormentor tied other cords around his wrists, and having
his own shoulders covered with leather, that they might not be chafed,
passed round them the rope which was to draw the cords, set his feet
against the wall, threw himself back with all his force, and the cords
cut through to the bones.This he did thrice, each time changing the
position of the cords, leaving a small distance between the successive
wounds; but it happened that in pulling the second time they slipped
into the first wounds, and caused such a gush of blood that Orobio
seemed to be bleeding to death."A physician and surgeon, who were in waiting as usual, to give their
opinion as to the safety or danger of continuing those operations,
that the inquisitors might not commit an irregularity by murdering the
patient, were called in.Being friends of the sufferer, they gave their
opinion that he had strength enough remaining to bear more.By this
means they saved him from a SUSPENSION of the torture, which would have
been followed by a repetition, on his recovery, under the pretext of
CONTINUATION.The cords were therefore pulled a third time, and this
ended the torture.He was dressed in his own clothes, carried back to
prison, and, after about seventy days, when the wounds were healed,
condemned as one SUSPECTED of Judaism.They could not say CONVICTED,
because he had not confessed; but they sentenced him to wear the
sambenito [Footnote: This sambenito (Suco bendito or blessed sack,) is
a garment (or kind of scapulary according to some writers,) worn by
penitents of the least criminal class in the procession of an Auto de
Fe, (a solemn ceremony held by the Inquisition for the punishment of
heretics,) but sometimes worn as a punishment at other times, that the
condemned one might be marked by his neighbors, and ever bear a signal
that would affright and scare by the greatness of the punishment and
disgrace; a plan, salutary it may be, but very grievous to the offender.It was made of yellow cloth, with a St.Andrew's cross upon it, of
red.A rope was sometimes put around the neck as an additional mark of
infamy."Those who were condemned to be burnt were distinguished by a habit of
the same form, called Zamarra, but instead of the red cross were
painted flames and devils, and sometimes an ugly portrait of the heretic
himself,--a head, with flames under it.Those who had been sentenced to
the stake, but indulged with commutation of the penalty, had inverted
flames painted on the livery, and this was called fuego revuelto,
"inverted fire.""Upon the head of the condemned was also placed a conical paper cap,
about three feet high, slightly resembling a mitre, called corona or
crown.This was painted with flames and devils in like manner with the
dress.]or penitential habit for two years, and then be banished for
life from Seville."INQUISITION OF GOA--IMPRISONMENT OF M. DELLON, 1673."M. Dellon a French traveller, spending some time at Damaun, on the
north-western coast of Hindostan, incurred the jealousy of the governor
and a black priest, in regard to a lady, as he is pleased to call
her, whom they both admired.He had expressed himself rather freely
concerning some of the grosser superstitions of Romanism, and thus
afforded the priest, who was also secretary of the Inquisition, an
occasion of proceeding against him as a heretic.The priest and the
governor united in a representation to the chief inquisitor at Goa,
which procured an order for his arrest.Like all other persons whom it
pleased the inquisitors or their servants to arrest, in any part of the
Portuguese dominions beyond the Cape of Good Hope, he was thrown into
prison with a promiscuous crowd of delinquents, the place and treatment
being of the worst kind, even according to the colonial barbarism of
the seventeenth century.To describe his sufferings there, is not to our
purpose, inasmuch as all prisoners fared alike, many of them perishing
from starvation and disease.Many offenders against the Inquisition
were there at the same time,--some accused of Judaism, others, of
Paganism--in which sorcery and witchcraft were included--and others of
immorality.In a field so wide and so fruitful, the "scrutators" of the
faith could not fail to gather abundantly.After an incarceration of at
least four months, he and his fellow-sufferers were shipped off for
the ecclesiastical metropolis of India, all of them being in irons.The
vessel put into Bacaim, and the prisoners were transferred, for some
days, to the prison of that town, where a large number of persons were
kept in custody, under charge of the commissary of the holy office,
until a vessel should arrive to carry them to Goa."In due time they were again at sea, and a fair wind wafted their
fleet into that port after a voyage of seven days.Until they could
be deposited in the cells of the Inquisition with the accustomed
formalities, the Archbishop of Goa threw open HIS prison for their
reception, which prison, being ecclesiastical, may be deemed worthy of
description."The most filthy," says Dellon, "the most dark, and the most horrible
that I ever saw; and I doubt whether a more shocking and horrible prison
can be found anywhere.It is a kind of cave wherein there is no day seen
but by a very little hole; the most subtle rays of the sun cannot enter
into it, and there is never any true light in it.* * *

"On the 16th of January 1674, at eight o'clock in the morning, an
officer came with orders to take the prisoners to "the holy house."With
considerable difficulty M. Dellon dragged his iron-loaded limbs thither.They helped him to ascend the stairs at the great entrance, and in the
hall, smiths were waiting to take off the irons from all the prisoners.One by one, they were summoned to audience.Dellon, who was called the
first, crossed the hall, passed through an ante-chamber, and entered
a room, called by the Portuguese "board of the holy office," where the
grand inquisitor of the Indies sat at one end of a very large table, on
an elevated floor in the middle of the chamber.He was a secular priest
about forty years of age, in full vigor--a man who could do his work
with energy.At one end of the room was a large crucifix, reaching from
the floor almost to the ceiling, and near it, sat a notary on a folding
stool.At the opposite end, and near the inquisitor, Dellon was placed,
and, hoping to soften his judge, fell on his knees before him.But the
inquisitor commanded him to rise, asked whether he knew the reason of
his arrest, and advised him to declare it at large, as that was the only
way to obtain a speedy release.Dellon caught at the hope of release,
began to tell his tale, mixed with tears and protestations, again
fell at the feet of Don Francisco Delgado Ematos, the inquisitor, and
implored his favorable attention.Don Francisco told him, very coolly,
that he had other business on hand, and, nothing moved, rang a silver
bell.The alcayde entered, led the prisoner out into a gallery, opened,
and searched his trunk, stripped him of every valuable, wrote an
inventory, assured him that all should be safely kept, and then led him
to a cell about ten feet square, and left him there, shut up in utter
solitude.In the evening they brought him his first meal, which he ate
heartily, and slept a little during the night following.Next morning he
learnt that he could have no part of his property, not even a breviary
was, in that place, allowed to a priest, for they had no form of
religion there, and for that reason he could not have a book.His hair
was cropped close; and therefore "he did not need a comb.""Thus began his acquaintance with the holy house, which he describes
as "great and magnificent," on one side of the great space before the
church of St Catharine.There were three gates in front; and, it was
by the central, or largest, that the prisoners entered, and mounted a
stately flight of steps, leading into the great hall.The side gates
provided entrance to spacious ranges of apartments, belonging to the
inquisitors.Behind the principal building, was another, very spacious,
two stories high, and consisting of double rows of cells, opening into
galleries that ran from end to end.The cells on the ground-floor were
very small, without any aperture from without for light or air.Those of
the upper story were vaulted, white-washed, had a small strongly grated
window, without glass, and higher than the tallest man could reach.Towards the gallery every cell was shut with two doors, one on the
inside, the other one outside of the wall.The inner door folded, was
grated at the bottom, opened towards the top for the admission of food
and was made fast with very strong bolts.The outer door was not so
thick, had no window, but was left open from six o'clock every morning
until eleven--a necessary arrangement in that climate, unless it were
intended to destroy life by suffocation."To each prisoner was given as earthen pot with water wherewith to wash,
another full of water to drink, with a cup; a broom, a mat whereon
to lie, and a large basin with a cover, changed every fourth day.The
prisoners had three meals a day; and their health so far as food could
contribute to it in such a place, was cared for in the provision of
a wholesome, but spare diet.Physicians were at hand to render all
necessary assistance to the sick, as were confessors, ready to wait
upon the dying; but they gave no viaticum, performed no unction, said
no mass.The place was under an impenetrable interdict.If any died,
and that many did die is beyond question, his death was unknown to all
without; he was buried within the walls without any sacred ceremony;
and if, after death, he was found to have died in heresy, his bones were
taken up at the next Auto, to be burned.Unless there happened to be
an unusual number of prisoners, each one was alone in his own cell.He
might not speak, nor groan, nor sob aloud, nor sigh.[Footnote: Limborch
relates that on one occasion, a poor prisoner was heard to cough; the
jailer of the Inquisition instantly repaired to him, and warned him to
forbear, as the slightest noise was not tolerated in that house.The
poor man replied that it was not in his power to forbear; a second time
they admonished him to desist; and when again, unable to do otherwise,
he repeated the offence, they stripped him naked, and cruelly beat him.This increased his cough, for which they beat him so often, that at last
he died through pain and anguish of the stripes he had received.]His
breathing might be audible when the guard listened at the grating, but
nothing more.Four guards were stationed in each long gallery, open,
indeed, at each end, but awfully silent, as if it were the passage of
a catacomb.If, however, he wanted anything, he might tap at the inner
door, when a jailer would come to hear the request, and would report to
the alcayde, but was not permitted to answer.If one of the victims, in
despair, or pain, or delirium, attempted to pronounce a prayer, even to
God, or dared to utter a cry, the jailers would run to the cell, rush
in, and beat him cruelly, for terror to the rest.Once in two months the
inquisitor, with a secretary and an interpreter, visited the prisons,
and asked each prisoner if he wanted anything, if his meat was regularly
brought, and if he had any complaint against the jailers.His want after
all lay at the mercy of the merciless.His complaint, if uttered, would
bring down vengeance, rather than gain redress.But in this visitation
the holy office professed mercy with much formality, and the
inquisitorial secretary collected notes which aided in the crimination,
or in the murder of their victims."The officers of Goa were;--the inquisidor mor or grand inquisitor, who
was always a secular priest; the second inquisitor, Dominican friar;
several deputies, who came, when called for, to assist the inquisitors
at trials, but never entered without such a summons; qualifiers,
as usual, to examine books and writings, but never to witness an
examination of the living, or be present at any act of the kind; a
fiscal; a procurator; advocates, so called, for the accused; notaries
and familiars.The authority of this tribunal was absolute in Goa.There does not appear to have been anything peculiar in the manner of
examining and torturing at Goa where the practice coincided with that of
Portugal and Spain."The personal narrative of Dellon affords a distinct exemplification of
the sufferings of the prisoners.He had been told that, when he desired
an audience, he had only to call a jailer, and ask it, when it would be
allowed him.But, notwithstanding many tears and entreaties, he could
not obtain one until fifteen days had passed away.Then came the alcayde
and one of his guards.This alcayde walked first out of the cell; Dellon
uncovered and shorn, and with legs and feet bare, followed him; the
guard walked behind.The alcayde just entered the place of audience,
made a profound reverence, stepped back and allowed his charge to enter.The door closed, and Dellon remained alone with the inquisitor and
secretary.He knelt; but Don Fernando sternly bade him to sit on a
bench, placed there for the use of the culprits.Near him, on a table,
lay a missal, on which they made him lay his hand, and swear to keep
secrecy, and tell them the truth.They asked if he knew the cause of his
imprisonment, and whether he was resolved to confess it.He told
them all he could recollect of unguarded sayings at Damaun, either in
argument or conversation, without ever, that he knew, contradicting,
directly or indirectly, any article of faith.He had, at some time
dropped an offensive word concerning the Inquisition, but so light a
word, that it did not occur to his remembrance.Don Fernando told him he
had done well in ACCUSING HIMSELF so willingly, and exhorted him in the
name of Jesus Christ, to complete his self accusation fully, to the end
that he might experience the goodness and mercy which were used in
that tribunal towards those who showed true repentance by a sincere
and UNFORCED confession.The secretary read aloud the confession and
exhortation, Dellon signed it, Don Fernando rang a silver bell, the
alcayde walked in, and, in a few moments, the disappointed victim was
again in his dungeon."At the end of another fortnight, and without having asked for it, he
was again taken to audience.After a repetition of the former questions,
he was asked his name, surname, baptism, confirmation, place of abode,
in what parish?They made him kneel,
and make the sign of the cross, repeat the Pater Noster, Hail Mary,
creed, commandments of God, commandments of the church, and Salve
Begins.He did it all very cleverly, and even to their satisfaction;
but the grand inquisitor exhorted him, by the tender mercies of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to confess without delay, and sent him to the cell again.They required him to do what was impossible--to
confess more, after he had acknowledged ALL.In despair, he tried to
starve himself to death; 'but they compelled him to take food.'Day and
night he wept, and at length betook himself to prayer, imploring pity
of the 'blessed Virgin,' whom he imagined to be, of all beings, the most
merciful, and the most ready to give him help."At the end of a month, he succeeded in obtaining another audience, and
added to his former confessions what he had remembered, for the first
time, touching the Inquisition.But they told him that that was not what
they wanted, and sent him back again.In a frenzy
of despair he determined to commit suicide, if possible.Feigning
sickness, be obtained a physician who treated him for a fever, and
ordered him to be bled.Never calmed by any treatment of the physician,
blood-letting was repeated often, and each time he untied the bandage,
when left alone, hoping to die from loss of blood, but death fled from
him.A humane Franciscan came to confess him, and, hearing his tale of
misery, gave him kind words, asked permission to divulge his attempt
at self-destruction to the inquisitor, procured him a mitigation of
solitude by the presence of a fellow-prisoner, a <DW64>, accused of
magic; but, after five months, the <DW64> was removed, and his mind,
broken with suffering, could no longer bear up under the aggravated
load.By an effort of desperate ingenuity he almost succeeded in
committing suicide, and a jailer found him weltering in his blood and
insensible.Having restored him by cordials, and bound up his wounds,
they carried him into the presence of the inquisitor once more; where he
lay on the floor, being unable to sit, heard bitter reproaches, had his
limbs confined in irons, and was thus carried back to a punishment that
seemed more terrible than death.In fetters he became so furious, that
they found it necessary to take them off, and, from that time, his
examinations assumed another character, as he defended his positions
with citations from the Council of Trent, and with some passages of
scripture, which he explained in the most Romish sense, discovering
a depth of ignorance in Don Fernando that was truly surprising.That
'grand Inquisitor,' had never heard the passage which Dellon quoted to
prove the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, 'Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'Neither did he know anything of that famous passage in the twenty-fifth
session of the Council of Trent, which declares that images are only to
be reverenced on account of the persons whom they represent.He
called for a Bible, and for the acts of the council, and was evidently
surprised when he found them where Dellon told him they might be seen."The time for a general auto drew near.During the months of November
and December, 1675, he heard every morning the cries of persons under
torture, and afterwards saw many of them, both men and women, lame and
distorted by the rack.On Sunday January 11th, 1676, he was surprised
by the jailer refusing to receive his linen to be washed--Sunday being
washing-day in the 'holy house.'While perplexing himself to think
what that could mean, the cathedral bells rang for vespers, and then,
contrary to custom, rang again for matins.He could only account for
that second novelty by supposing that an auto would be celebrated the
next day.They brought him supper, which he refused, and, contrary to
their wont at all other times, they did not insist on his taking it, but
carried it away.Assured that those were all portents of the horrible
catastrophe, and reflecting on often-repeated threats in the audience
chamber that he should be burnt, he gave himself up to death, and
overwhelmed with sorrow, fell asleep a little before midnight."Scarcely had he fallen asleep when the alcayde and guards entered the
cell, with great noise, bringing a lamp, for the first time since his
imprisonment that they had allowed a lamp to shine there.The alcayde,
laying down a suit of clothes, bade him put them on, and be ready to go
out when he came again.At two o'clock in the morning they returned, and
he issued from the cell, clad in a black vest and trowsers, striped with
white, and his feet bare.About two hundred prisoners, of whom he
was one, were made to sit on the floor, along the sides of a spacious
gallery, all in the same black livery, and just visible by the
gleaming of a few lamps.A large company of women were also ranged in a
neighboring gallery in like manner.But they were all motionless, and
no one knew his doom.Every eye was fixed, and each one seemed benumbed
with misery."A third company Dellon perceived in a room not far distant, but they
were walking about, and some appeared to have long habits.Those were
persons condemned to be delivered to the secular arm, and the long
habits distinguished confessors busily collecting confessions in order
to commute that penalty for some other scarcely less dreadful.At four
o'clock, servants of the house came, with guards, and gave bread and
figs to those who would accept the refreshment.One of the guards gave
Dellon some hope of life by advising him to take what was offered,
which he had refused to do.'Take your bread,' said the man, 'and if you
cannot eat it now, put it in your pocket; you will be certainly hungry
before you return.'This gave hope, that he should not end the day at
the stake, but come back to undergo penance."A little before sunrise, the great bell of the cathedral tolled, and
its sound soon aroused the city of Goa.The people ran into the streets,
lining the chief thoroughfares, and crowding every place whence a view
could be had of the procession.Day broke, and Dellon saw the faces
of his fellow-prisoners, most of whom were Indians.He could only
distinguish, by their complexion, about twelve Europeans.Every
countenance exhibited shame, fear, grief, or an appalling blackness of
apathy, AS IF DIRE SUFFERING IN THE LIGHTLESS DUNGEONS UNDERNEATH HAD
BEREFT THEM OF INTELLECT.The company soon began to move, but slowly,
as one by one the alcayde led them towards the door of the great hall,
where the grand inquisitor sat, and his secretary called the name of
each as he came, and the name of a sponsor, who also presented himself
from among a crowd of the bettermost inhabitants of Goa, assembled there
for that service.'The general of the Portuguese ships in the Indies'
had the honor of placing himself beside our Frenchman.As soon as the
procession was formed, it marched off in the usual order."First, the Dominicans, honored with everlasting precedence on all such
occasions, led the way.Singing-boys also preceded, chanting a litany.The banner of the Inquisition was intrusted to their hands.After the
banner walked the penitents--a penitent and a sponsor, two and two.A
cross bearer brought up the train, carrying a crucifix aloft, turned
towards them, in token of pity; and, on looking along the line, you
might have seen another priest going before the penitents with a
crucifix turned backwards, inviting their devotions.They to whom the
Inquisition no longer afforded mercy, walked behind the penitents, and
could only see an averted crucifix.These were condemned to be burnt
alive at the stake!On this occasion there were but two of this class,
but sometimes a large number were sentenced to this horrible death, and
presented to the spectator a most pitiable spectacle.Many of them
bore upon their persons the marks of starvation, torture, terror, and
heart-rending grief.Some faces were bathed in tears, while others
came forth with a smile of conquest on the countenance and words of
triumphant faith bursting from the lips.These, however, were known as
dogmatizers, and were generally gagged, the month being filled with a
piece of wood kept in by a strong leather band fastened behind the head,
and the arms tied together behind the back.Two armed familiars walked
or rode beside each of these, and two ecclesiastics, or some other
clerks or regulars, also attended.After these, the images of heretics
who had escaped were carried aloft, to be thrown into the flames; and
porters came last, tagging under the weight of boxes containing the
disinterred bodies on which the execution of the church had fallen, and
which were also to be burnt."Poor Dellon went barefoot, like the rest, through the streets of Goa,
rough with little flint stones scattered about, and sorely were his feet
wounded during an hour's march up and down the principal streets.Weary,
covered with shame and confusion, the long train of culprits entered
the church of St.Francis, where preparation was made for the auto, the
climate of India not permitting a celebration of that solemnity
under the burning sky.They sat with their sponsors, in the galleries
prepared, sambenitos, grey zamarras with painted flames and devils,
corozas, tapers, and all the other paraphernalia of an auto, made up a
woeful spectacle.The inquisitor and other personages having taken their
seats of state, the provincial of the Augustinians mounted the pulpit
and delivered the sermon.Dellon preserved but one note of it.The
preacher compared the Inquisition to Noah's ark, which received all
sorts of beasts WILD, but sent them out TAME.The appearance of hundreds
who had been inmates of that ark certainly justified the figure."After the sermon, two readers went up, one after the other, into the
same pulpit, and, between them, they read the processes and pronounced
the sentences, the person standing before them, with the alcayde, and
holding a lighted taper in his hand.Dellon, in turn, heard the cause
of his long-suffering.He had maintained the invalidity of baptismus
flaminis, or desire to be baptised, when there is no one to administer
the rite of baptism by water.He had said that images ought not to be
adored, and that an ivory crucifix was a piece of ivory.He had spoken
contemptuously of the Inquisition.And, above all, he had an ill
intention.His punishment was to be confiscation of his property,
banishment from India, and five years' service in the galleys in
Portugal, with penance, as the inquisitors might enjoin.As all the
prisoners were excommunicate, the inquisitor, after the sentence had
been pronounced, put on his alb and stole, walked into the middle of the
church, and absolved them all at once.Dellon's sponsor, who would not
even answer him before, when he spoke, now embraced him, called him
brother, and gave him a pinch of snuff, in token of reconciliation."But there were two persons, a man and a woman, for whom the church had
no more that they could do; and these, with four dead bodies, and the
effigies of the dead, were taken to be burnt on the Campo Santo Lazaro,
on the river side, the place appointed for that purpose, that the
viceroy might see justice done on the heretics, as he surveyed the
execution from his palace-windows."The remainder of Dellon's history adds nothing to what we have already
heard of the Inquisition.He was taken to Lisbon, and, after working in
a gang of convicts for some time, was released on the intercession of
some friends in France with the Portuguese government.With regard to
his despair, and attempts to commit suicide, when in the holy house,
we may observe that, as he states, suicide was very frequent there.The contrast of his disconsolate impatience with the resignation and
constancy of Christian confessors in similar circumstances, is obvious.As a striking illustration of the difference between those who suffer
without a consciousness of divine favor, and those who rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory, we would refer the reader to that noble
band of martyrs who suffered death at the stake, at the Auto held in
Seville, on Sunday, September 24, 1559.At that time twenty-one
were burnt, followed by one effigy, and eighteen penitents, who were
released."One of the former was Don Juan Gonzales, Presbyter of Seville, an
eminent preacher.With admirable constancy he refused to make any
declaration, in spite of the severe torture, saying that he had not
followed any erroneous opinions, but that he had drawn his faith from
the holy Scriptures; and for this faith he pleaded to his tormentors in
the words of inspiration.He maintained that he was not a heretic, but
a Christian, and absolutely refused to divulge anything that would bring
his brethren into trouble.Two sisters of his were also brought out to
this Auto, and displayed equal faith.They would confess Christ, they
said, and suffer with their brother, whom they revered as a wise and
holy man.They were all tied to stakes on the quemadero, a piece of
pavement, without the walls of the city, devoted to the single use of
burning human victims.Sometimes this quemadero [Footnote: Llorente, the
historian of the Spanish Inquisition, says, "So many persons were to be
put to death by fire, the governor of Seville caused a permanent raised
platform of masonry to be constructed outside the city, which has
lasted to our time (until the French revolution) retaining its name of
Quemadero, or burning-place, and at the four corners four large hollow
stalutes of limestone, within which they used to place the impenitent
alive, that they might die by slow fires."]was a raised platform of
stone, adorned with pillows or surrounded with statues, to distinguish
and beautify the spot.Just as the fire was lit, the gag, which had
hitherto silenced Don Juan, was removed, and as the flames burst from
the fagots, he said to his sisters, 'Let us sing, Deus laudem meam ne
tacueris.'And they sang together, while burning, 'Hold not thy peace,
O God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the
deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a
lying tongue.'Thus they died in the faith of Christ, and of his holy
gospel."INQUISITION OF GOA, CONCLUDED.The Inquisition of Goa continued its Autos for a century after the
affair of Dellon.Claudius Buchanan visited
that city, and had been unexpectedly invited by Joseph a Doloribus,
second and most active inquisitor, to lodge with him during his
visit.Buchanan found himself, heretic,
schismatic, and rebel as he was, politely entertained by so dread a
personage.Regarding his English visitor merely as a literary man, or
professing to do so, Friar Joseph, himself well educated, seemed to
enjoy his company, and was unreservedly communicative on every subject
not pertaining to his own vocation.When that subject was first
introduced by an apparently incidental question, he did not hesitate
to return the desired information, telling Dr.Buchanan that the
establishment was nearly as extensive as in former times.In the library
of the chief inquisitor he saw a register containing the names of all
the officers, who still were numerous.On the second evening after his arrival, the doctor was surprised to see
his host come from his apartment, clothed in black robes from head to
foot, instead of white, the usual color of his order (Augustinian).He
said that he was going to sit on the tribunal of the holy office, and it
transpired that, so far from his "august office" not occupying much of
his time, he had to sit there three or four days every week.After his
return, in the evening, the doctor put Dellon's book into his hand,
asking him if he had ever seen it.He had never seen it before, and,
after reading aloud and slowly, "Relation de l'Inquisition de Goa,"
began to peruse it with eagerness.Buchanan employed himself in writing, Friar Joseph devoured
page after page; but as the narrative proceeded, betrayed evident
symptoms of uneasiness.He then turned to the middle, looked at the end,
skimmed over the table of contents, fixed on its principal passages,
and at one place exclaimed, in his broad Italian accent, "Mendacium!The doctor requested him to mark the passages that were
untrue, proposed to discuss them afterwards, and said he had other books
on the subject.The mention of other books startled him; he looked up
anxiously at some books on the table, and then gave himself up to the
perusal of Dellon's "Relation," until bedtime.Even then, he asked
permission to take it to his chamber.The doctor had fallen asleep under the roof of the inquisitor's convent,
confident, under God, in the protection at that time guaranteed to
a British subject, his servants sleeping in the gallery outside
the chamber-door.About midnight, he was waked by loud shrieks and
expressions of terror from some one in the gallery.In the first moment
of surprise, he concluded it must be the alguazils of the holy office
seizing his servants to carry them to the Inquisition.But, on going
out, he saw the servants standing at the door, and the person who
had caused the alarm, a boy of about fourteen, at a little distance,
surrounded by some of the priests, who had come out of their cells on
hearing the noise.The boy said he had seen a spectre; and it was a
considerable time before the agitations of his body and voice
subsided.Next morning at breakfast, the inquisitor apologized for
the disturbance, and said the boy's alarm proceeded from a phantasma
animi,--phantom of the imagination.Phantoms might well haunt such a place.As to
Dellon's book, the inquisitor acknowledged that the descriptions
were just; but complained that he had misjudged the motives of the
inquisitors, and written uncharitably of Holy Church.Their conversation
grew earnest, and the inquisitor was anxious to impress his visitor with
the idea that the Inquisition had undergone a change in some respects,
and that its terrors were mitigated.Buchanan plainly
requested to see the Inquisition, that he might judge for himself as to
the humanity shown to the inmates,--according to the inquisitor,--and
gave, as a reason why he should be satisfied, his interest in the
affairs of India, on which he had written, and his purpose to write on
them again, in which case he could scarcely be silent concerning the
Inquisition.The countenance of his host fell; but, after some further
observations, he reluctantly promised to comply.Next morning, after
breakfast, Joseph a Doloribus went to dress for the holy office, and
soon returned in his black robes.He said he would go half an hour
before the usual time, for the purpose of showing him the Inquisition.The doctor fancied he looked more severe than usual, and that his
attendants were not as civil as before.But the truth was, that the
midnight scene still haunted him.They had proceeded in their palanquins
to the holy house, distant about a quarter of a mile from the convent,
and the inquisitor said as they were ascending the steps of the great
entrance, that he hoped the doctor would be satisfied with a transient
view of the Inquisition, and would retire when he should desire him to
do so.The doctor followed with tolerable confidence, towards the
great hall aforementioned, where they were met by several well-dressed
persons, familiars, as it afterwards appeared, who bowed very low to the
inquisitor, and looked with surprise at the stranger.Buchanan paced
the hall slowly, and in thoughtful silence; the inquisitor thoughtful
too, silent and embarrassed.A multitude of victims seemed to haunt the
place, and the doctor could not refrain from breaking silence."Would
not the Holy Church wish, in her mercy, to have those souls back again,
that she might allow them a little further probation?"The inquisitor
answered nothing, but beckoned him to go with him to a door at one end
of the hall.By that door he conducted him to some small rooms, and
thence, to the spacious apartments of the chief inquisitor.Having
surveyed those, he brought him back again to the great hall, and seemed
anxious that the troublesome visitor should depart; but only the very
words of Dr.B. can adequately describe the close of this extraordinary
interview.""Now, father," said I, "lead me to the dungeons below: I want to see the
captives.""No," said he, "that cannot be."I now began to suspect that
it had been in the mind of the inquisitor, from the beginning, to show
me only a certain part of the Inquisition, in the hope of satisfying
my inquiries in a general way.I urged him with earnestness; but he
steadily resisted, and seemed offended, or, rather, agitated, by my
importunity.I intimated to him plainly, that the only way to do justice
to his own assertion and arguments regarding the present state of the
Inquisition, was to show me the prisons and the captives.I should
then describe only what I saw; but now the subject was left in awful
obscurity."Lead me down," said I, "to the inner building, and let me
pass through the two hundred dungeons, ten feet square, described by
your former captives.Let me count the number of your present captives,
and converse with them.I WANT, TO SEE IF THERE BE ANY SUBJECTS OF THE
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, TO WHOM WE OWE PROTECTION.I want to ask how long
they have been there, how long it is since they have seen the light
of the sun, and whether they ever expect to see it again.Show me the
chamber of torture, and declare what modes of execution or punishment
are now practiced inside the walls of the Inquisition, in lieu of the
public Auto de Fe.If, after all that has passed, father, you resist
this reasonable request, I should be justified in believing that you are
afraid of exposing the real state of the Inquisition in India."To these observations the inquisitor made no reply; but seemed impatient
that I should withdraw."My good father," said I; "I am about to take
my leave of you, and to thank you for your hospitable attentions; and I
wish to preserve on my mind a favorable sentiment of your kindness and
candor.You cannot, you say, show me the captives and the dungeons; be
pleased, then, merely to answer this question, for I shall believe
your word: how many prisoners are there now below in the cells of the
Inquisition?"He replied, "That is a question which I cannot answer."On his pronouncing these words, I retired hastily towards the door, and
wished him farewell.We shook hands with as much cordiality as we could,
at the moment, assume; and both of us, I believe, were sorry that our
parting took place with a clouded countenance.Buchanan, feeling as if he could
not refrain from endeavoring to get another and perhaps a nearer view,
returned to avail himself of the pretext afforded by a promise from
the chief inquisitor, of a letter to one of the British residents at
Travancore, in answer to one which he had brought him from that officer.The inquisitors he expected to find within, in the "board of the holy
office."The door-keepers surveyed him doubtfully, but allowed him to
pass.He entered the great hall, went up directly to the lofty crucifix
described by Dellon, sat down on a form, wrote some notes, and then
desired an attendant to carry in his name to the inquisitor.As he was
walking across the hall, he saw a poor woman sitting by the wall.She
clasped her hands, and looked at him imploringly.The sight chilled
his spirits; and as he was asking the attendants the cause of her
apprehension,--for she was awaiting trial,--Joseph a Doloribus came, in
answer to his message, and was about to complain of the intrusion,
when he parried the complaint by asking for the letter from the chief
inquisitor.He promised to send it after him, and conducted him to the
door.As they passed the poor woman, the doctor pointed to her, and said
with emphasis, "Behold, father, another victim of the Holy Inquisition."The other answered nothing; they bowed, and separated without a word.Buchanan published his "Christian Researches in Asia," in the
year 1812, the Inquisition still existed at Goa; but the establishment
of constitutional government in Portugal, put an end to it throughout
the whole Portuguese dominions.APPENDIX V.

INQUISITION AT MACERATA, ITALY.I never pretended that it was for the sake of religion alone, that I
left Italy, On the contrary, I have often declared, that, had I never
belonged to the Inquisition, I should have gone on, as most Roman
Catholics do, without ever questioning the truth of the religion I was
brought up in, or thinking of any other.But the unheard of cruelties
of that hellish tribunal shocked me beyond all expression, and rendered
me,--as I was obliged, by my office of Counsellor, to be accessary to
them,--one of the most unhappy men upon earth.I therefore began
to think of resigning my office; but as I had on several occasions,
betrayed some weakness as they termed it, that is, some compassion and
humanity, and had upon that account been reprimanded by the Inquisitor,
I was well apprized that my resignation would be ascribed by him to
my disapproving the proceedings of the holy tribunal.And indeed, to
nothing else could it be ascribed, as a place at that board was a
sure way to preferment, and attended with great privileges, and a
considerable salary.Being, therefore, sensible how dangerous a thing it
would be to give the least ground for any suspicions of that nature,
and no longer able to bear the sight of the many barbarities practised
almost daily within those walls, nor the reproaches of my conscience for
being accessary to them, I determined, after many restless nights, and
much deliberation, to withdraw at the same time from the Inquisition,
and from Italy.In this mind, and in the most unhappy and tormenting
situation that can possibly be imagined, I continued near a
twelve-month, not able to prevail on myself to execute the resolution
I had taken on account of the many dangers which I foresaw would
inevitably attend it, and the dreadful consequences of my failing in
the attempt.But, being in the mean time ordered by the Inquisitor, to
apprehend a person with whom I had lived in the greatest intimacy and
friendship, the part I was obliged to act on that occasion, left so deep
an impression on my mind as soon prevailed over all my fears, and made
me determine to put into execution, at all events, and without delay,
the design I had formed.Of that transaction I shall give a particular
account, as it will show in a very strong light the nature and
proceedings of that horrid court.The person whom the Inquisitor appointed me to apprehend was Count
Vicenzo della Torre, descended from an illustrious family in Germany,
and possessed of a very considerable estate in the territory of
Macerata.He was one of my very particular friends, and had lately
married the daughter of Signior Constantini, of Fermo, a lady no less
famous for her good sense than her beauty.With her family too, I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, while Professor of Rhetoric in
Fermo, and had often attended the Count during his courtship, from
Macerata to Fermo, but fifteen miles distant.I therefore lived with
both in the greatest friendship and intimacy; and the Count was the
only person that lived with me, after I was made Counsellor of the
Inquisition, upon the same free footing as he had done till that time.My other friends had grown shy of me, and gave me plainly to understand
that they no longer cared for my company.As this unhappy young gentleman was one day walking with another, he met
two Capuchin friars, and turning to his companion, when they had passed,
"what fools," said he, "are these, to think they shall gain heaven by
wearing sackcloth and going barefoot!Fools indeed, if they think so,
or that there is any merit in tormenting one's self; they might as well
live as we do, and they would get to heaven quite as soon."Who informed
against him, whether the friars, his companion, or somebody else, I
know not; for the inquisitors never tell the names of informers to the
Counsellors, nor the names of the witnesses, lest they should except
against them.It is to be observed, that all who hear any proposition
that appears to them repugnant to, or inconsistent with the doctrines of
holy mother church, are bound to reveal it to the Inquisitor, and also
to discover the person by whom it was uttered; and, in this affair no
regard is to be had to any ties, however sacred.The brother being bound
to accuse the brother, the father the son, the son the father, the wife
her husband, and the husband his wife; and all bound on pain of eternal
damnation, and of being treated as accomplices if they do not denounce
in a certain time; and no confessor can absolve a person who has heard
anything said in jest or in earnest, against the belief or practice
of the church, till that person has informed the Inquisitor of it, and
given him all the intelligence he can concerning the person by whom it
was spoken.Whoever it was that informed against my unhappy friend, whether the
friars, his companion, or somebody else who might have overheard him,
the Inquisitor acquainted the board one night, (for to be less observed,
they commonly meet, out of Rome, in the night) that the above mentioned
propositions had been advanced, and advanced gravely, at the sight of
two poor Capuchins; that the evidence was unexceptionable; and that
they were therefore met to determine the quality of the proposition, and
proceed against the delinquent.There are in each Inquisition twelve Counsellors, viz: four Divines,
four Canonists, and four Civilians.It is chiefly the province of the
divines to determine the quality of the proposition, whether it is
heretical, or only savors of heresy; whether it is blasphemous and
injurious to God and His saints or only erroneous, rash, schismatical,
or offensive to pious ears.The part of the proposition, "Fools!if
they think there is any merit in tormenting one's self," was judged and
declared heretical, as openly contradicting the doctrine and practice of
holy mother church recommending austerities as highly meritorious.The
Inquisitor observed, on this occasion, that by the proposition, "Fools
indeed" &c., were taxing with folly, not only the holy fathers, who had
all to a man practised great austerities, but St.Paul himself as the
Inquisitor understood it, adding that the practice of whipping one's
self, so much recommended by all the founders of religious orders, was
borrowed of the great apostle of the gentiles.The proposition being declared heretical, it was unanimously agreed by
the board that the person who had uttered it should be apprehended, and
proceeded against agreeably to the laws of the Inquisition.And now the
person was named; for, till it is determined whether the accused person
should or should not be apprehended, his name is kept concealed from
the counsellors, lest they should be biased, says the directory, in
his favor, or against him.For, in many instances, they keep up an
appearance of justice and equity, at the same time that, in truth, they
act in direct opposition to all the known laws of justice and equity.No words can express the concern and astonishment it gave me to hear,
on such an occasion, the name of a friend for whom I had the greatest
esteem and regard.The Inquisitor was apprised of it; and to give me an
opportunity of practising what he had so often recommended to me, viz.conquering nature with the assistance of grace, he appointed me to
apprehend the criminal, as he styled him, and to lodge him safe, before
daylight, in the prison of the holy inquisition.I offered to excuse
myself, but with the greatest submission, from being in any way
concerned in the execution of that order; an order, I said, which I
entirely approved of, but only wished it might be put in execution by
some other person; for your lordship knows, I said, the connection.But
the Inquisitor shocked at the word, said with a stern look and angry
tone of voice, "What!There is your guard," (pointing to the Sbirri or bailiffs in waiting)
"let the criminal be secured in St.Luke's cell," (one of the worst,)
"before three in the morning."He then withdrew, and as he passed me
said, "Thus, nature is conquered."I had betrayed some weakness or sense
of humanity, not long before, in fainting away while I attended the
torture of one who was racked with the utmost barbarity, and I had on
that occasion been reprimanded by the Inquisitor for suffering nature
to get the better of grace; it being an inexcusable weakness, as he
observed, to be in any degree affected with the suffering of the body,
however great, when afflicted, as they ever are in the Holy Inquisition,
for the good of the soul.And it was, I presume, to make trial of the
effect of that reprimand, that the execution of this cruel order was
committed to me.As I could by no possible means decline it, I summoned
all my resolution, after passing an hour by myself, I may say in the
agonies of death, and set out a little after two in the morning for my
unhappy friend's house, attended by a notary of the Inquisition, and six
armed Sbirri.We arrived at the house by different ways and knocking
at the door, a maid-servant looked out of the window, and asked who
knocked."The Holy Inquisition," was the answer, and at the same time
she was ordered to awake nobody, but to come down directly and open the
door, on pain of excommunication.At these words, the servant hastened
down, half naked as she was, and having with much ado, in her great
fright, opened the door, she conducted us as she was ordered to her
master's chamber.She often looked very earnestly at me, as she knew me,
and showed a great desire to speak with me; but of her I durst take no
kind of notice.I entered the bed-chamber with the notary, followed by
the Sbirri, when the lady awakening at the noise, and seeing the bed
surrounded by armed men, screamed out aloud and continued screaming as
out of her senses, till one of the Sbirri, provoked at the noise gave
her a blow on the forehead that made the blood flow, and she swooned
away.I rebuked the fellow severely, and ordered him to be whipped as
soon as I returned to the Inquisition.In the mean time, the husband awakening, and seeing me with my
attendants, cried out, in the utmost surprise, "MR.He said no
more, nor could I for some time utter a single word; and it was with
much ado that, in the end I so far mastered my grief as to be able
to let my unfortunate friend know that he was a prisoner of the Holy
Inquisition."Alas I what have I
done?He said many affecting things;
but as I knew it was not in my power to befriend him, I had not the
courage to look him in the face, but turning my back to him, withdrew,
while he dressed, to a corner of the room, to give vent to my grief.The
notary stood by, quite unaffected.Indeed, to be void of all humanity,
to be able to behold one's fellow-creatures groaning under the most
exquisite torments cruelty can invent, without being in the least
affected with their sufferings, is one of the chief qualifications of
an inquisitor, and what all who belong to the Inquisition must strive to
attain to.It often happens, at that infernal tribunal, that while the
unhappy, and probably innocent, person is crying out in their presence
on the rack, and begging by all that is sacred for one moment's relief,
in a manner one would think no human heart could withstand, it often
happens, I say, that the inquisitor and the rest of his infamous crew,
quite unaffected with his complaints, and deaf to his groans, to his
tears and entreaties, are entertaining one another with the news of the
town; nay, sometimes they even insult, with unheard of barbarity, the
unhappy wretches in the height of their torment.He was no sooner dressed than I
ordered the Bargello, or head of the Sbirri, to tie his hands with
a cord behind his back, as is practised on such occasions without
distinction of persons; no more regard being paid to men of the first
rank, when charged with heresy, than to the meanest offender.Heresy
dissolves all friendship; so that I durst no longer look upon the man
with whom I had lived in the greatest friendship and intimacy as my
friend, or show him, on that account, the least regard or indulgence.As we left the chamber, the countess, who had been conveyed out of the
room, met us, and screaming out in the most pitiful manner upon seeing
her husband with his hands tied behind his back like a thief or robber,
flew to embrace him, and hanging on his neck, begged, with a flood of
tears, we would be so merciful as to put an end to her life, that she
might have the satisfaction--the only satisfaction she wished for in
this world, of dying in the bosom of the man from whom she had vowed
never to part.The count, overwhelmed with grief, did not utter a single
word.I could not find it in my heart, nor was I in a condition to
interpose; and indeed a scene of greater distress was never beheld by
human eyes.However, I gave a signal to the notary to part them, which
he did accordingly, quite unconcerned; but the countess fell into a
swoon, and the count was meantime carried down stairs, and out of the
house, amid the loud lamentations and sighs of his servants, on all
sides, for he was a man remarkable for the sweetness of his temper, and
his kindness to all around him.Being arrived at the Inquisition, I consigned my prisoner into the
hands of a gaoler, a lay brother of St.Dominic, who shut him up in the
dungeon above-mentioned, and delivered the key to me.I lay that night
at the palace of the Inquisition, where every counsellor has a room, and
returned next morning the key to the inquisitor, telling him that his
order had been punctually complied with.The inquisitor had been already
informed of my conduct by the notary, and therefore, upon my delivering
the key to him, he said, "You have acted like one who is at least
desirous to overcome, with the assistance of grace, the inclinations of
nature;" that is, like one who is desirous, by the assistance of grace,
to metamorphose himself from a human creature into a brute or a devil.In the Inquisition, every prisoner is kept the first week of his
imprisonment in a dark narrow dungeon, so low that he cannot stand
upright in it, without seeing anybody but the gaoler, who brings him,
EVERY OTHER DAY, his portion of bread and water, the only food allowed
him.This is done, they say, to tame him, and render him, thus weakened,
more sensible of the torture, and less able to endure it.At the end of
the week, he is brought in the night before the board to be examined;
and on that occasion my poor friend appeared so altered, in a week's
time, that, had it not been for his dress, I should not have known him.And indeed no wonder; a change of condition so sudden and unexpected;
the unworthy and barbarous treatment he had already met with; the
apprehension of what he might and probably should suffer; and perhaps,
more than anything else, the distressed and forlorn condition of his
once happy wife, whom he tenderly loved, whose company he had enjoyed
only six months, could be attended with no other effect.Being asked, according to custom, whether he had any enemies, and
desired to name them, he answered, that he bore enmity to no man, and he
hoped no man bore enmity to him.For, as in the Inquisition the person
accused is not told of the charge brought against him, nor of the person
by whom it is brought, the inquisitor asks him if he has any enemies,
and desires him to name them.If he names the informer, all further
proceedings are stopped until the informer is examined anew; and if the
information is found to proceed from ill-will and no collateral proof
can be produced, the prisoner is discharged.Of this piece of justice
they frequently boast, at the same time that they admit, both as
informers and witnesses, persons of the most infamous characters,
and such as are excluded by all other courts.In the next place, the
prisoner is ordered to swear that he will declare the truth, and conceal
nothing from the holy tribunal, concerning himself or others, that he
knows and the holy tribunal desires to know.He is then interrogated for
what crime he has been apprehended and imprisoned by the Holy Court of
the Inquisition, of all courts the most equitable, the most cautious,
the most merciful.To that interrogatory the count answered, with a
faint and trembling voice, that he was not conscious to himself of any
crime, cognizable by the Holy Court, nor indeed by any other; that he
believed and ever had believed whatever holy mother church believed or
required him to believe.He had, it seems quite forgotten what he
had unthinkingly said at the sight of the two friars.The inquisitor,
therefore, finding that he did not remember or would not own his crime,
after many deceitful interrogatories, and promises which he never
intended to fulfil, ordered him back to his dungeon, and allowing him
another week, as is customary in such cases, to recollect himself, told
him that if he could not in that time prevail upon himself to declare
the truth, agreeably to his oath, means would be found of forcing it
from him; and he must expect no mercy.At the end of the week he was brought again before the infernal
tribunal; and being asked the same questions, returned the same answers,
adding, that if he had done or said anything amiss, unwittingly or
ignorantly, he was ready to own it, provided the least hint of it were
given him by any there present, which he entreated them most earnestly
to do.He often looked at me, and seemed to expect--which gave me such
concern as no words can express--that I should say something in his
favor.But I was not allowed to speak on this occasion, nor were any of
the counsellors; and had I been allowed to speak, I durst not have said
anything in his favor; the advocate appointed by the Inquisition, and
commonly styled, "The Devil's Advocate," being the only person that
is suffered to speak for the prisoner.The advocate belongs to the
Inquisition, receives a salary from the Inquisition, and is bound by an
oath to abandon the defence of the prisoner, if he undertakes it, or not
to undertake it, if he finds it cannot be defended agreeably to the laws
of the Holy Inquisition; go that the whole is mere sham and imposition.I have heard this advocate, on other occasions, allege something in
favor of the person accused; but on this occasion he declared that he
had nothing to offer in defence of the criminal.In the Inquisition, the person accused is always supposed guilty, unless
he has named the accuser among his enemies.And he is put to the torture
if he does not plead guilty, and own the crime that is laid to his
charge, without being so much as told what it is; whereas, in all other
courts, where tortures are used, the charge is declared to the party
accused before he is tortured; nor are they ever inflicted without
a credible evidence of his guilt.But in the Inquisition, a man is
frequently tortured upon the deposition of a person whose evidence would
be admitted in no other court, and in all cases without hearing the
charge.As my unfortunate friend continued to maintain his innocence,
not recollecting what he had said, he was, agreeably to the laws of
the Inquisition, put to the torture.He had scarcely borne it twenty
minutes, crying out the whole time, "Jesus Maria!"when his voice failed
him at once, and he fainted away.He was then supported, as he hung
by his arms, by two of the Sbirri, whose province it is to manage the
torture, till he returned to himself.He still continued to declare that
he could not recollect his having said or done anything contrary to the
Catholic faith, and earnestly begged they would let him know with what
he was charged, being ready to own it if it was true.The Inquisitor was then so gracious as to put him in mind of what he had
said on seeing the two Capuchins.The reason why they so long conceal
from the party accused the crime he is charged with, is, that if he
should be conscious to himself of his having ever said or done anything
contrary to the faith, which he is not charged with, he may discover
that too, imagining it to be the very crime he is accused of.After a
short pause, the poor gentleman owned that he had said something to that
purpose; but, as he had said it with no evil intention, he had never
more thought of it, from that time to the present.He added, but with a
voice so faint, as scarce could be heard, that for his rashness he was
willing to undergo what punishment soever the holy tribunal should,
think fit to impose on him; and he again fainted away.Being eased for
a while of his torment, and returned to himself, he was interrogated by
the promoter fiscal (whose business it is to accuse and to prosecute, as
neither the informer nor the witnesses, are ever to appear,) concerning
his intention.For in the Inquisition, it is not enough for the party
accused to confess the fact, he must declare whether his intention was
heretical or not; and many, to redeem themselves from the torments
they, can no longer endure, own their intention was heretical, though
it really was not.My poor friend often told us, he was ready to say
whatever he pleased, but as he never directly acknowledged his intention
to have been heretical, as is required by the rules of the court, he
was kept on the torture still, quite overcome with the violence of the
anguish, he was ready to expire.Being taken down, he was carried quite
senseless, back to his dungeon, and there, on the third day, death put
an end to his sufferings.The Inquisitor wrote a note to his widow, to
desire her to pray for the soul of her late husband, and warn her not
to complain of the holy Inquisition, as capable of any injustice or
cruelty.The estate was confiscated to the Inquisition, and a small
jointure allowed out of it to the widow.As they had only been
married six months, and some part of the fortune was not yet paid, the
inquisitor sent an order to the Constantini family, at Ferno, to pay the
holy office, and without delay, what they owed to the late Count Della
Torre.The effects of heretics are all ipso facto confiscated to the
Inquisition from the very day, not of their conviction, but of their
crime, so that all donations made after that time are void; and whatever
they may have given, is claimed by the Inquisition, into whatsoever
hands it may have passed; even the fortunes they have given to their
daughters in marriage, have been declared to belong to, and are claimed
by the Inquisition; nor can it be doubted, that the desire of those
confiscations is one great cause of the injustice and cruelty of that
court.The death of the unhappy Count Della Torre was soon publicly known; but
no man cared to speak of it, not even his nearest relations, nor so much
as to mention his name, lest anything should inadvertently escape them
that might be construed into a disapprobation of the proceedings of the
most holy tribunal; so great is the awe all men live in of that jealous
and merciless court.The deep impression that the death of my unhappy friend, the barbarous
and inhuman treatment he had met with, and the part I had been obliged
to act in so affecting a tragedy, made on my mind, got at once the
better of my fears, so that, forgetting in a manner the dangers I had
till then so much apprehended, I resolved, without further delay to put
in execution the design I had formed, of quitting the Inquisition, and
bidding forever adieu to Italy.To execute that design with some safety,
I proposed to beg leave to visit the Virgin of Loretto, but thirteen
miles distant, and to pass a week there; but in the mean time, to make
the best of my way out of the reach of the Inquisition.Having, therefore, after many conflicts with myself, asked leave to
visit the neighboring sanctuary, and obtained it, I set out on horseback
the very next morning, leaving, as I proposed to keep the horse, his
full value with the owner.I took the road to Loretto, but turned out
of it a short distance from Recanati, after a most violent struggle with
myself, the attempt appearing to me at that juncture, quite desperate
and impracticable; and the dreadful doom reserved for me should I
miscarry, presented itself to my mind in the strongest light.But the
reflection that I had it in my power to avoid being taken alive, and
a persuasion that a man in my situation might lawfully avoid it, when
every other means failed him, at the expense of his life, revived my
staggered resolution; and all my fears ceasing at once, I steered my
course, leaving Loretto behind me, to Rocca Contrada, to Fossonbrone, to
Calvi in the dukedom of Urbino, and from thence through the Romagna into
Bolognese, keeping the by-roads, and at a good distance from the cities
through which the high road passed.Thus I advanced very slowly, travelling in very bad roads, and often in
places where there was no road at all, to avoid, not only the cities,
and towns, but also the villages.In the mean time I seldom had any
other support but some coarse provisions, and a very small quantity
even, of them, that the poor shepherds, the countrymen or wood cleavers
I met in those unfrequented by-places, could spare me.My horse fared
not much better than myself; but, in choosing my sleeping-place I
consulted his convenience as much as my own, passing the night where I
found most shelter for myself, and most grass for him.In Italy there
are very few solitary farm-houses or cottages, the country people all
living together in villages; and I thought it far safer to lie where I
could be in any way sheltered, than to venture into any of them.Thus I
spent seventeen days before I got out of the ecclesiastical state; and
I very narrowly escaped being taken or murdered, on the very borders of
that state; it happened thus.I had passed two whole days without any kind of subsistence whatever,
meeting with no one in the by-roads that could supply me with any, and
fearing to come near any house, as I was not far from the borders of the
dominions of the Pope.I thought I should be able to hold out till I
got into the Modanese, where I believed I should be in less danger than
while I remained in the papal dominions.But finding myself, about noon
of the third day, extremely weak and ready to faint away, I came into
the high road that leads from Bologna to Florence, a few miles distant
from the former city, and alighted at a post house, that stood quite
by itself.Having asked the woman of the house whether she had any
victuals, and being told that she had, I went to open the door of the
only room in the house, (that being a place where gentlemen only stop
to change horses,) and saw to my great surprise, a placard pasted on it,
with a minute description of my whole person, sad a promise of a reward
of 900 crowns (about 200 pounds English money) for delivering me up
alive to the Inquisition, being a fugitive from that holy tribunal,
and of 600 crowns for my head.By the same placard, all persons were
forbidden, on pain of the greater excommunication, to receive or
harbor, entertain, conceal, or screen me, or to be in any way aiding, or
assisting me to make my escape.This greatly alarmed me, as the reader
may well imagine; but I was still more frightened, when entering the
room, I saw two fellows drinking there, who, fixing their eyes on me as
soon as I went in, continued looking at me very steadfastly.I strove,
by wiping my face and blowing my nose, and by looking out of the window,
to prevent their having a full view of my features.But, one of
them saying, "The gentleman seems afraid to be seen," I put up my
handkerchief, and turning to the fellow, said boldly, "What do you mean
you rascal?Look at me; am I afraid to be seen?"He said nothing, but
looking again steadfastly at me, and nodding his head, went out, and
his companion immediately followed him.I watched them, and seeing them,
with two or three more, in close conference, and no doubt consulting
whether they should apprehend me or not, I walked that moment into
the stable, mounted my horse unobserved by them, and while they were
deliberating in an orchard behind the house, rode off at full speed, and
in a few hours got into the Modanese, where I refreshed both with food
and rest, as I was there in no immediate danger, my horse and myself.I
was indeed surprised to find that those fellows did not pursue me, nor
can I in any other way account for it, but by supposing, what is not
improbable, that, as they were strangers as well as myself, and had all
the appearance of banditti or ruffians flying out of the dominions of
the Pope, the woman of the house did not care to trust them with her
horses.From the Modanese I continued my journey, more leisurely through
the Parmesan, the Milanese, and part of the Venetian territory, to
Chiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the
Inquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying
from it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still
I carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no
Inquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope's nuncio who resides
at Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have
persuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the
order.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite
refreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two
small cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There
I missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and
discovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I
knew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the
city before me was Lucerne.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the
road as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I
passed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with
sheep's milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next
morning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of
Lucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,
and having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among
them by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter
myself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed
and rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,
I got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was
obliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no
light to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much
difficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little
cottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,
and what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "There is no way here to lose."I
then asked him what canton I was in?and upon his answering that I was
in the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God
that I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I
was, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping
out of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those
who sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and
entertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;
regaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision
he had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other
for himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as
her husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which
her husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well
understood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public
home on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never
passed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in
the morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how
I rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,
obliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had
sent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most
sincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all
means attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said
was but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first
going back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the
only way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring
canton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;
for I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow
path on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so
many pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and
surprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;
for, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all
danger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept
of any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of
having relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a
sufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the
college of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the
rector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from
Italy, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the
motives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,
and my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no
notice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and
did not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I
was till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued
there till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second
letter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by
the congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back
into Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if
I obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,
that the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to
the nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,
advised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general's kind letter, the rector was of opinion
that I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,
not only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,
but as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be
usefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus
agreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and
me, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at
his request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival
in England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the
general's letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably
observed; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest
ingratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been
known at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to
my flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.For
although a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the
reach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not
only have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides
constantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they
please on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not
without his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early
next morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat
indisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different
course, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there
in no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the
Inquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been
ordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman
Catholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and
deserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being
discovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,
did I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I
was very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much
shorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me
that very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This
alarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly
apprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,
fleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck
to meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,
attended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed
me immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every
thing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his
Lordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage
to London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French
troops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors
were driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant
remonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his
troops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four
hundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very
beautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,
Spain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that
when travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at
Rotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French
army, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents
of her prison life, from which we take the following extract:

"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up
yet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL
FIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well
as my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed
me a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large
brass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven
was burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was
there.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led
me to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both
sides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of
it, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all
the circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she
showed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, 'Now,
my good mistress, I'll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and
gradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father's will, and for
heretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it
being locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,
and by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The
second is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy
fathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the
executioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.The third is for
those who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and
veneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the
pit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.'Then Mary
said to me that another day she would show me the torments for public
sinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;
but I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the
very thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me
to the heart.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very
obedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the
torment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the
Inquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de
Salas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months
before, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced
several witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at
Valladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought
into his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and
laid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,
just large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a
bar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an
exquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the
breathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,
so laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of
them encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the
blasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence
of such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the
Athanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being
still bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine
linen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an
earthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition
to his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But
again, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had
never uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then
pulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the
linen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords
on his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he
had never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his
tormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as
begun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could
survive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest
umbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,
and be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as
cruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one
Catalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,
EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named
Juan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had
observed that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and
that, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their
feet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was
peculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of
Benevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once
summoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several
interviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he
was forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,
he had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it
necessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other
examinations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go
beyond three leagues' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the
inquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,
called the 'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,' stripped naked, and bound
to the 'ladder.'This might well have extorted something like confession
from an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might
say when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,
and therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of
pain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison
until the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a
lighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,
paid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,
but released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and
a person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or
supposed criminal.Bower found related at length
in the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors
throughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely
described in that order.One Answering the description in many
particulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small
distance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there
decoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO
LOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,
the unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he
never recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY
THE INQUISITION."It would be easy to fill a volume with such narratives as the above, but
we forbear.We are not writing a history of the Inquisition.We simply
wish to exhibit the true spirit by which the Romanists are actuated in
their dealings with those over whom they have power.We therefore, in
closing this chapter of horrors, beg leave to place before our readers
one of the FATHERLY BENEDICTIONS with which, His Holiness, the Pope,
dismisses his refractory subjects.Does it not show most convincingly
what he would do here in America, if he had, among us, the power he
formerly possessed in the old world, when the least inadvertent word
might perchance seal the doom of the culprit?A POPISH BULL OK CURSE."Pronounced on all who leave the Church of Rome.By the authority of God
Almighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin
Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all celestial virtues,
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim,
and of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all the Apostles and
Evangelists, of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb
are found worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs and Holy
Confessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all the Saints, together
with the Holy Elect of God,--MAY HE BE DAMNED.We excommunicate and
anathematize him, from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty.We sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and be delivered
over with Datham and Abiram, and with those who say unto the Lord,
'Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways;' as a fire is quenched with
water, so let the light of him be put out forevermore, unless it shall
repent him, and make satisfaction."May the Father who creates man, curse him.May the Son, who suffered
for us, curse him!May the Holy Ghost who is poured out in baptism,
curse him!May the Holy Cross, which Christ for our salvation,
triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him!"May the Holy Mary, ever Virgin and Mother of God, curse him!May all
the Angels, Principalities, and Powers, and all heavenly Armies curse
him!May the glorious band of the Patriarchs and Prophets curse him!John the Precursor, and St John the Baptist, and St.Andrew and all other of Christ's Apostles together
curse him and may the rest of the Disciples and Evangelists who by their
preaching converted the universe, and the Holy and wonderful company
of Martyrs and Confessors, who by their works are found pleasing to God
Almighty; may the holy choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of
God have despised the things of the world, damn him.May all the Saints
from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages, who are found to be
beloved of God, damn him!"May he be damned wherever he be, whether in the house or in the alley,
in the woods or in the water, or in the church!May he be cursed in
living or dying!"May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being hungry, in being
thirsty, in fasting and sleeping, in slumbering, and in sitting, in
living, in working, in resting, and in blood letting!May he be cursed
in all the faculties of his body!"May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly.May he be cursed in his hair;
cursed be he in his brains, and his vertex, in his temples, in his
eyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
teeth, and grinders, in his lips, in his shoulders, in his arms, and in
his fingers."May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and
purtenances, down to the very stomach!"May he be cursed in his reins and groins, in his thighs and his hips,
and in his knees, his legs and his feet, and his toe-nails!"May he be cursed in all his joints, and articulation of the members;
from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet, may there be no
soundness!"May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of his majesty, CURSE
HIM!And may Heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise
up against him, and curse and damn him; unless he repent and make
satisfaction!Such was the CURSE pronounced on the Rev.Hogan, (a converted Roman
Catholic priest) a few years since, in Philadelphia.As a further proof of the cruel, persecuting spirit of Catholicism, let
us glance at a few extracts from their own publications."Children," they say, "are obliged to denounce their parents or
relations who are guilty of heresy; ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE
BURNT.They may refuse them all nourishment, and permit them to die
with hunger; or they may KILL THEM as enemies, who violate the rights of
humanity.--Escobar, Theolg."A man condemned by the Pope, may be killed wherever he is found.""Children may kill their parents, if they would turn their children
from the Popish faith.""If a judge decide contrary to law, the injured
person may defend himself by killing the judge."--Fangundez Precept
Decal, vol."To secretly kill your calumniator, to avoid scandal, is
justifiable.""You may kill before hand, any person who may put you to death,
not EXCEPTING THE JUDGE, AND WITNESSES, because it is
self-defence.""A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking possession of any
Ecclesiastical office.""You may charge your opponent with false crime to take away his credit,
as well as kill him."--Guimenius, prop, 8, p."Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.""You may kill any man to save a crown.""BY THE COMMAND OF GOD IT IS LAWFUL TO MURDER THE INNOCENT, TO ROB, AND
TO COMMIT ALL KIND OF WICKEDNESS, BECAUSE HE IS THE LORD OF LIFE
AND DEATH, AND ALL THINGS; AND THUS TO FULFILL HIS MANDATE IS OUR
DUTY."Again, in the Romish Creed found in the pocket of Priest Murphy, who was
killed in the battle of Arklow, 1798, we find the following articles."We acknowledge that the priests can make vice virtue, and virtue vice,
according to their pleasure."We are bound to believe that the holy massacre was lawful, and lawfully
put into execution, against Protestants, and likewise WE ARE TO CONTINUE
THE SAME, PROVIDED WITH SAFETY TO OUR LIVES!"We are bound not to keep our oaths with heretics, though bound by the
most sacred ties.We are bound not to believe their oaths; for their
principles are damnation.We are bound to drive heretics with fire,
sword, <DW19>, and confusion, out of the land; as our holy fathers say,
if their heresies prevail we will become their slaves.We are bound
to absolve without money or price, those who imbrue their hands in
the blood of a heretic!"Do not these extracts show very clearly that
Romanism can do things as bad as anything in the foregoing narrative?Whenever we refer to the relentless cruelties of the Romanists, we are
told, and that, too, by the influential, the intelligent, those who are
well-informed on other subjects, that "these horrid scenes transpired
only in the 'dark ages;'" that "the civilization and refinement of the
present age has so modified human society, so increased the milk of
human kindness, that even Rome would not dare, if indeed she had the
heart, to repeat the cruelties of by-gone days."For the honor of humanity we could hope that this opinion was correct;
but facts of recent date compel us to believe that it is as false as it
is ruinous to the best interests of our country and the souls of men.A few of these facts, gathered from unquestionable sources, and some of
them related by the actors and sufferers themselves, we place before the
reader.In November, 1854, Ubaldus Borzinski, a monk of the Brothers of Mercy,
addressed an earnest petition to the Pope, setting forth the shocking
immoralities practised in the convents of his order in Bohemia.He specifies nearly forty crimes, mostly perpetrated by priors and
subpriors, giving time, place, and other particulars, entreating the
Pope to interpose his power, and correct those horrible abuses.For sending this petition, he was thrown into a madhouse of the Brothers
of Mercy, at Prague, where he still languishes in dreary confinement,
though the only mark of insanity he ever showed was in imagining that
the Pope would interfere with the pleasures of the monks.This Ubaldus has a brother, like minded with himself, also a member of
the same misnamed order of monks, who has recently effected his escape
from durance vile.John Evangelist Borzinski was a physician in the convent of the Brothers
of Mercy at Prague.By the
study of the Psalms and Lessons from the New Testament, which make up
a considerable part of the Breviary used in cloisters, he was first
led into Protestant views.He had been for seventeen years resident in
different cloisters of his order, as sick-nurse, alms gatherer,
student, and physician, and knew the conventual life out and out.As he
testifies: "There was little of the fear of God, so far as I could
see, little of true piety; but abundance of hypocrisy, eye-service,
deception, abuse of the poor sick people in the hospitals, such love
and hatred as are common among the children of this world, and the most
shocking vices of every kind."He now felt disgust for the cloister life, and for the Romish religion,
and he sought, by the aid of divine grace, to attain to the new birth
through the Word of God.Speaking of his change of views to a Prussian
clergyman, he thus describes his conversion: "Look you, it was thus I
became a Protestant.I found a treasure in that dustheap, and went away
with it."He then thought
within himself, if these detached passages can give such light, what an
illumination he must receive if he could read and understand the whole
Bible.He did not, however, betray his dissatisfaction, but devoted himself
to his professional duties with greater diligence.He might still have
remained in the Order, his life hid with Christ in God, had not the
hierarchy, under pretence of making reforms and restoring the neglected
statutes of the Order, brought in such changes for the worse as led him
to resolve to leave the order, and the Romish church as well.Following
his convictions, and the advice of a faithful but very cautious
clergyman, he betook himself to the territories of Prussia, where, on
the 17th of January, 1855, he was received into the national church at
Petershain, by Dr.Nowotny, himself formerly a Bohemian priest.This was
not done till great efforts had been made to induce him to change his
purpose, and also to get his person into the power of his adversaries.As he had now left the church of Rome, become an openly acknowledged
member of another communion, he thought he might venture to return to
his own country.Taking leave of his Prussian friends, to whom he had
greatly endeared himself by his modesty and his lively faith, he went
back to Bohemia, with a heart full of peace and joy.He lived for some time amidst many perplexities, secluded in the house
of his parents at Prosnitz, till betrayed by some who dwelt in the same
habitation.On the 6th of March he was taken out of bed, at eight, by
the police, and conveyed first to the cloister in Prosnitz, where he
suffered much abuse, and from thence to the cloister in Prague.Here the
canon Dittrich, "Apostolical Convisitator of the Order of the Brothers
of Mercy," justified all the inhuman treatment he had suffered, and
threatened him with worse in case he refused to recant and repent.Dittrich not only deprived him of his medical books, but told him that
his going over to Protestantism was a greater crime than if he had
plundered the convent of two thousand florins.He was continually dinned
with the cry, "Retract, retract!"He was not allowed to see his brother,
confined in the same convent, nor other friends, and was so sequestered
in his cell as to make him feel that he was forgotten by all the world.He managed, through some monks who secretly sympathized with him, to get
a letter conveyed occasionally to Dr.These letters were filled
with painful details of the severities practised upon him.In one of
them he says, "My only converse is with God, and the gloomy walls around
me."He was transferred to a cell in the most unwholesome spot, and
infested with noisome smells not to be described.Close by him were
confined some poor maniacs, sunk below the irrational brutes.Under date of April 23d he writes: "Every hour, in this frightful
dungeon seems endless to me.For many weeks have I sat idle in this
durance, with no occupation but prayer and communion with God."His
appeals to civil authority and to the Primate of Hungary procured him no
redress, but only subjected him to additional annoyances and hardships.His aged father, a man of four-score years, wept to see him, though of
sound understanding, locked up among madmen; and when urged to make his
son recant, would have nothing to do with it, and returned the same
day to his sorrowful home.As he had been notified that he was to be
imprisoned for life, he prayed most earnestly to the Father of mercies
for deliverance; and he was heard, for his prayers and endeavors wrought
together.The sinking of his health increased his efforts to escape;
for, though he feared not to die, he could not bear the thought of dying
imprisoned in a mad-house, where he knew that his enemies would take
advantage of his mortal weakness to administer their sacraments to him,
and give out that he had returned to the bosom of the church, or at
least to shave his head, that he might be considered as an insane
person, and his renunciation of Romanism as the effect of derangement
of mind.Several plans of escape were projected, all beset with much
difficulty and danger.The one he decided upon proved to be successful.On Saturday, the 13th of October, at half-past nine in the evening, he
fastened a cord made of strips of linen to the grate of a window, which
grate did not extend to the top.Having climbed over this, he lowered
himself into a small court-yard.He had now left that part of the
establishment reserved for the insane, and was now in the cloistered
part where the brethren dwelt.He saw
at a distance a servant of the insane approaching with a light; and
with aching heart and trembling limbs, by a desperate effort, climbed
up again.He returned to his cell, concealing his cord, and laid himself
down to rest.On the following Monday, he renewed his efforts to escape.He lowered
himself, as before, into the little court-yard; but being weak in health
and much shaken in his nervous system by all he had suffered in body and
mind, he was seized with palpitation of the heart and trembled all over,
so that he could not walk a step.He laid down to rest and recover his
breath.He felt as if he could get no further."But," he says in his
affecting narrative, "My dear Saviour to whom I turned in this time of
need, helped me wonderfully.I felt now, more than ever in my life, His
gracious and comforting presence, and believed, in that dismal moment,
with my whole soul, His holy word;" "My grace is sufficient for thee;
for my strength is made perfect in weakness."Borzinski now arose, pulled off his boots, and though every step was
made with difficulty, he ascended the stairs leading to the first story.He went along the passage way until he came to a door leading into
corridors where the cloister brethren lodged.But the trembling fit came
over him again, with indescribable anguish, as he sought to open the
door with a key with which he had been furnished.He soon rallied again,
and, like a spectre, gliding by the doors of the brethren, who occupied
the second and third corridors, many of whom had lights still burning,
he came with his boots in one hand, and his bundle in the other, to
a fourth passage way, in which was an outside window he was trying to
reach.The cord was soon fastened to the window frame, yet still in
bitter apprehension; for this window was seldom opened, and opened
hard, and with some noise.It was also only two steps distant from the
apartment of the cloister physician, where there was a light, and it was
most likely that, on the first grating of the window, he would rush
out and apprehend the fugitive.However the window was opened without
raising any alarm, and now it was necessary to see that no one was
passing below; for though the spot is not very much frequented, yet
the streets cross there, and people approach it from four different
directions.During these critical moments, one person and another kept
passing, and poor Borzinski tarried shivering in the window for near a
quarter of an hour before he ventured to let himself down.While he
was waiting his opportunity he heard the clock strike the third quarter
after nine and knew that he had but fifteen minutes to reach the house
where he was to conceal himself, which would be closed at ten.When all
was still, he called most fervently on the Saviour, and grasping the
cord, slid down into the street.He could scarce believe his feet were
on the ground.Trembling now with joy and gratitude rather than fear, he
ran bareheaded to his place of refuge, where he received a glad welcome.Having changed his garb, and tarried till three o'clock in the morning,
he took leave of his friends and passing through the gloomy old capital
of Bohemia, he reached the Portzitscher Gate, in order to pass out
as early as possible.Just then a police corporal let in a wagon, and
Borzinski, passed out unchallenged.It is needless to follow him further
in his flight.We have given enough, of his history to prove that
conventual establishments are at this moment what they ever have
been--dangerous alike to liberty and life.AMERICAN AND FOREIGN
CHRISTIAN UNION.In place of labored arguments we give the following history of personal
suffering as strikingly illustrative of the spirit of Romanism at the
present day.APPENDIX VII

NARRATIVE OP SIGNORINA FLORIENCIA D' ROMANI, A NATIVE OF THE CITY OF
NAPLES.I was born in the year 1826, of noble and wealthy parents.Our mansion
contained a small chapel, with many images, sacred paintings, and a
neatly furnished mass altar.As he lived on the rents and income
of his estates, he had little to do, except to amuse himself with his
friends.My mother, who was of as mild and sweet disposition, loved my
father very dearly, but was very unhappy the most of the time because
my father spent so much of his time in drinking with his dissolute
companions, card playing, and in balls, parties, theatres, operas,
billiards, &c. Father did not intend to be unkind to my mother, for he
gave her many servants, and abundance of gold, horses, carriages and
grooms, and said frequently in my hearing, that his wife should be as
happy as a princess.Such was the state of society in Italy that men
thought their wives had no just reason to complain, so long as they were
furnished with plenty of food, raiment and shelter.One of my father's most intimate friends was the very Rev.Father
Salvator, a Priest of the order of St.Francis; he wore the habit of
the order, his head was about half shaved.The sleeves of his habit were
very large at the elbow; in these sleeves he had small pockets, in which
he usually carried his snuff box, handkerchief, and purse of gold.This
priest was merry, full of fun and frolic; he could dance, sing, play
cards, and tell admirably funny stories, such as would make even the
devils laugh in their chains.Such was the influence and power this Franciscan had over my father and
mother, that in our house, his word was law.He was our confessor, knew
the secrets and sins, and all the weak points of every mind in the whole
household.My own dear mother taught me to read before I was seven years
of age.As I was the only child, I was much petted and caressed, indeed,
such was my mother's affection for me that I was seldom a moment out of
her sight.There was a handsome mahogany confessional in our own chapel.When the priest wanted any member of the household to come to him to
confession, he wrote the name on a slate that hung outside the chapel
door, saying that he would hear confessions at such a time to-morrow.Thus, we would always have time for the full examination of our
consciences.Only one at a time was ever admitted into the chapel, for
confessional duty, and the priest always took care to lock the door
inside and place the key in his sleeve pocket.My mother and myself were
obliged to confess once a week; the household servants, generally once a
month.My father only once a year, during Lent, when all the inhabitants
of seven years, and upwards, are obliged to kneel down to the priests,
in the confessional, and receive the wafer God under the severest
penalties.Woe to the individual who resists the ecclesiastical mandate.When I was about fourteen years of age, I was sent to the Ursuline
Convent, to receive my education.My dear mother would have preferred
a governess or a competent teacher to teach me at home but her will was
but a mere straw in the hands of our confessor and priestly tyrant.It
was solely at the recommendation of the confessor, that I was imprisoned
four years in the Ursuline Convent.As my confessor was also the
confessor of the convent, he called himself my guardian and protector,
and recommended me to the special care of the Mother Abbess, and her
holy nuns, the teachers, who spent much of their time in the school
department.As my father paid a high price, quarterly, for my tuition
and board, I had a good room to myself, my living was of the best kind,
and I always had wine at dinner.The nuns, my teachers, took much more
pains to teach me the fear of the Pope, bishops and confessors, than
the fear of God, or the love of virtue.In fact, with the exception of a
little Latin and embroidery, which I learned in those four years, I came
out as ignorant as I was before, unless a little hypocrisy may be called
a useful accomplishment.For, of all human beings on earth, none can
teach hypocrisy so well as the Romish priests and nuns.In the school
department young ladies seldom have much to complain of, unless they are
charity scholars; in that case the poor girls have to put up with very
poor fare, and much hard work, hard usage and even heavy blows; how my
heart has ached for some of those unfortunate girls, who are treated
more like brutes, than human beings, because they are orphans, and poor.Yet they in justice are entitled to good treatment, for thousands of
scudi (dollars) are sent as donations to the convents for the support
of these orphans, every year, by benevolent individuals.So that as poor
and unfortunate as these girls are, they are a source of revenue to the
convents.For the first three years of my convent life, I passed the time in
the school department, without much anxiety of mind.I was gay and
thoughtless, my great trouble was to find something to amuse myself,
and kill time in some way.Though I treated all the school-mates with
kindness, and true Italian politeness, I became intimate with only one.She was a beautiful girl, from the dukedom of Tuscany.She made me her
confidant, and told me all her heart.Her parents were wealthy, and both
very strict members of the Romish Church.But she had an aunt in the
city of Geneva, who was a follower of John Calvin, or a member of the
Christian church of Switzerland.This aunt had been yearly a visitor at
her father's house.She being her father's only sister, an affectionate
intimacy was formed between the aunt and niece.The aunt, being a very
pious, amiable woman, felt it her duty to impress the mind of the niece,
with the superiority of the religion of the holy bible over popish
traditions; and the truth of the Scriptures soon found its way to the
heart of my young friend.But her confessor soon found out that some
change was going on in her mind, and told her father.There were
only two ways to save her soul from utter ruin; one was to give her
absolution and kill her before she got entirely out of the holy mother
church; the other, was to send her to the Ursuline convent at Naples,
where by the zeal and piety of those celebrated nuns, she might be
secured from further heresy.From this, the best friend of my school days, I learned more about God's
word, and virtue, and truth, and the value of the soul, than from all
other sources.There was a garden surrounded by a high wall, in which we
frequently walked, and whispered to each other, though we trembled all
the while for fear our confessor would by some means, find out that we
looked upon the Romish church as the Babylon destined to destruction,
plainly spoken of by St.My young friend stood in great fear of the priests; she trembled at the
very sight of one.Her aunt had read to her the history and sufferings of the persecuted
Protestants of Europe.She was a frail, and timid girl, yet such was the
depth of her piety and the fervor of her religious faith, that she often
declared to me that she would prefer death to the abandonment of those
heavenly principles she had embraced, which were the source of her
joy and hope.Her aunt gave her a pocket New Testament, in the Italian
language, which she prized above all the treasures of earth, and carried
with her carefully, wherever she went.I borrowed it and read it every
opportunity I had.I took much
pains to commit to memory all I could of the blessed book, for in
case of our separation, I knew not where I could obtain another.My
god-father who was a bishop, called to see me on my fifteenth birth day,
and presented me with a splendid gold watch and chain richly studded
with jewels, made in England, and valued at 200 scudi, saying that
he had it imported expressly for my use.I had also several diamond
articles of jewelry, presents I had received from my father from time to
time.I had also, in my purse, 100 scudi in gold, which I had saved from
my pin money.All the above property, I should have cheerfully given for
a copy of the Holy Bible, in my own beautiful Italian language.A few
months after I received the rich present from the Bishop, he called with
my father and my confessor to see me.My heart almost came into my mouth
when I saw them alight from my father's carriage, and enter the chapel
door of the convent.Very soon the lady porter came to me and said,
"Signorina, you are wanted in the parlor."As my Tuscan friend had taught me to pray, and ask the Lord Jesus for
grace and strength, I walked into my room, locked the door, and on my
knees, called upon the Lord to save me from becoming a nun--for I
knew then it was a determination on the part of the Abbess, bishop
and confessor, that I should take the veil.I was the only child, and
heiress of an immense fortune, of course, too good a prize to be lost.After a short and fervent prayer to my Lord and Saviour, I walked down
to see what was to be my doom.I kissed my father's cheek, and kissed
the hands of the Bishop and confessor--yet my very soul revolted
from the touch of these whited sepulchres.All received me with great
cordiality, yea, even more than usual affection.Soon after our meeting,
my father asked permission of the Bishop to speak to me privately and
taking me into a small room, said to me, "My dear daughter, you are not
aware of the great misfortune that has recently come upon your father.While I was excited with wine at the card-table last evening, betting
high and winning vast sums of money, I so far forgot myself and my duty
to the laws of the country, that I called for a toast, and induced
a number of my inebriated companions to drink the health of Italian
liberty, and we all drank and gave three cheers for liberty and a
liberal constitution.A Benedictine Friar being present, took all our
names to the Commissary General, and offered to be a witness against
us in the King's Court.As this is my first and only offence, the holy
Bishop your god-father offers on certain conditions, to visit Rome
immediately on my behalf, and secure the mediation of the holy Father
Pius IX.Your venerable god-father has great influence at Rome, being
a special favorite with his holiness, and his holiness can obtain any
favor he asks of King Ferdinand.So if you will only consent to take the
Black Veil, your father will be saved from the State prison."This was terrible news to my young and palpitating heart.It was the
first heavy blow that I had experienced in this vale of tears.I did not
speak for some minutes; I could not.My trembling bosom heaved like the
waves of the ocean before the blast.My veins were almost bursting; my
hands and feet became as cold as marble, and when I attempted to speak
my words seemed ready to choke me to death.I fell upon my knees and called upon God for mercy and help.My
father, thinking I had gone mad, was greatly alarmed.The Bishop
and confessor, who were anxiously waiting the result of my father's
proposition, hearing my father weep and sob aloud, came in to see what
the matter was.In the midst of my prayer, I fainted away, and became
entirely unconscious.When I came to myself, I found myself on the bed.As I opened my eyes, it all seemed like a dream.The abbess spoke to me
very kindly, and sprinkled my bed with holy water, and at the same time
laid a large bronze crucifix on my breast, saying that Satan must be
driven from my soul, for had it not been for the devil, I would have
leaped for joy, and not fainted when father mentioned the black veil."No," said the holy mother, "had it not been for the devil you would
rejoice to take the holy black veil blessed by the Holy Madonna and the
blessed saints Clara and Theresa.It is a holy privilege that very few
can enjoy on earth.Yea, my daughter, there can not be a greater sin
in the sight of the Madonna and the blessed saints, than to reject a
secluded life.Yea," said the crafty old nun, (who was thinking much
more about my gold, than my soul,) "I never knew a young lady who had
the offer of becoming a nun and rejected it, who ever came to a good
end.If they refuse, and marry, they generally die in child-bed with the
first child, or they will marry cruel husbands, who beat them and kill
them by inches.Therefore, dear daughter, let me most affectionately
warn you as you have had the honor of being selected by the holy Bishop
and our holy confessor to the high dignity and privilege of a professed
nun, of the order of St.Ursula, reject it not at your peril.Be
assured, heaven knows how to punish such rebellion."My head ached so violently at the time, and I was so feverish that I
begged the old woman to send for my mother, and to talk to me no more on
the subject of the black veil, but to drop it until some future time.In
my agony on account of the foul plot against my liberty, my virtue, and
my gold, I felt such a passion of rage come upon me, that had I absolute
power for the moment I would have cast every Abbess, Pope, Bishop and
Priest into the bottomless pit.May the Lord forgive me, but I would
have done it at that time with a good will.The greatest comfort I now
had was reading my Tuscan friend's New Testament, or hearing it read by
her when we had a chance to be by ourselves, which was not very often.In the evening of the same day of my illness, father and mother came to
see me, and Satan came also in the shape of the confessor; so that I
had not a moment alone with my dear parents.The confessor feared my
determined opposition to a convent's life, for he had previous to this,
several times in the confessional, dropped hints to me on the great
happiness, purity, serenity and joy of all holy nuns.But I always told
him I would not be a nun for the world.I should be so good, it would
kill me in a short time."No, no, father," said I, "I WILL NOT BE A
NUN."Father spoke to me again of his great misfortune--told me that his trial
would come on in a few days and that he was now at liberty on a
very heavy bail; that the Bishop was only waiting my answer to start
immediately for the holy city, and throw himself at the feet of the holy
Pope to procure father's unconditional pardon from the King.I said
"my dear father, how long will you be imprisoned if you do not get a
pardon?""From two to five years," he replied."My daughter, it is
my first offence, and I have witnesses to prove that the priest who
appeared against me, urged me to drink wine several times after I had
drank a large quantity, and was the direct cause of my saying what
I did."Now it all came to me, that the whole of it was a plot, a
Jesuitical trick, to get my father in the clutches of the law, and then
make a slave of me for life through my sympathy for my dear father.The vile priests knew that I loved my father most ardently; in fact, my
father and mother were the only two beings on earth that I did love.My
mother I loved most tenderly, but my affection for my father was of a
different kind.I loved him most violently, with all the ardor of my
soul.Mother seemed all the home to me; but father was to me all the
world beside.He would frequently
come home, and get me to go out into the garden and play with him,
just as though he was my brother.There we would swing, run, jump and
exercise in several healthy games, common in our climate.He never gave
me an unkind word or an unkind reproof.If I did say anything wrong, he
would take me to my mother and say, "Clara, here I bring you a prisoner,
let her be kept on bread and water till dinner time."Even when mother
had displeased him about some trifle, so that he had not a smile for
her, he always had a smile for his Flora.Even now, while I write, a
chill comes over my frame, while I think of that vile Popish plot.I
said to my father, "You shall not be imprisoned if I can prevent it; at
the same time I do not see any great gain, comfort or profit in having
your only daughter put in prison for life, without the hope of liberty
ever more, to save you from two years imprisonment."At these words, the eyes of the confessor flashed like lurid lightnings;
his very frame shook, as though he had the fever and ague.Truth seemed
so strange to the priest, that he found it hard of digestion.Father
and mother both wept, but made no reply.The idea of putting their only
child in a dungeon for life, though it might be done in the sacred name
of religion, did not seem to give them much comfort "Father," said I, "I
wish to see you at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, without fail--I wish
to see you alone; don't bring mother or any one else with you.You shall
not go to prison, all will yet be well."On account of this reasonable
request, to see my father alone, the confessor arose in a terrible rage
and left the apartment As quick as the mad priest left us to ourselves,
I told my father my plan, or what I would like to do with his
permission.My plan was, for my mother and myself to get into our
carriage and drive to the palace of King Ferdinand and make him
acquainted with all the truth; for I was aware from what I had heard,
that the King had heard only the priest's side of the story.My father
stood in such fear of the priests that he only consented to my plan with
great reluctance, saying that we ought first to make our plan known to
the confessor, lest he should be offended.To this my mother responded,
saying, "My daughter, it would be very wrong for us to go to the King,
or take any step without the advice of our spiritual guide."Here,
I felt it to be my duty to reveal to my deceived parents some of the
secrets of the confessional, though I might, in their estimation,
be guilty of an unpardonable sin by breaking the seal of iniquity.I
revealed to my parents the frequent efforts of the priest to obtain my
consent to take the veil, and that I had opposed from first to last,
every argument made use of to rob me of the society of my parents, of my
liberty, and of everything I held dear on earth.As to the happiness of
the nuns so much talked of by the priests, from what I had seen in their
daily walk and general deportment, I was fully convinced that there was
no reality in it; they were mere slaves to their superiors, and not half
so happy as the free slaves on a plantation who have a kind master.My
parents saw my determination to resist to the death every plan for my
imprisonment in the hateful nunnery.Therefore they promised that I
should have the opportunity to see the King on the morrow in company
with my mother.On the following day, at twelve o'clock, we left the convent in our
carriage for the palace.We were very politely received by the gentleman
usher, who conducted us to seats in the reception-room.After sending
our cards to the king, we waited nearly one hour before he made his
appearance.His majesty received us with much kindness, raised us
immediately from our knees, and demanded our business.I was greatly
embarrassed at first, but the frank and cordial manner of the sovereign
soon restored me to my equilibrium, and I spoke freely in behalf of my
dear father.The king heard me through very patiently, with apparent
interest, and said, "Signorina, I am inclined to believe you have spoken
the truth; and as your father has always been a good loyal subject, I
shall, for your sake, forgive him this offence; but let him beware that
henceforth, wine or no wine, he does not trespass against the laws
of the kingdom, for a second offence I will not pardon.Go in peace,
signoras, you have my royal word."We thanked his majesty, and returned to our home with the joyful
tidings.My father, who had been waiting the
result of our visit to the palace with great impatience, received us
with open arms, and pressed us to his heart again and again.I was so excited that, long before we got to him, I cried out, "All is
well, all is well, father.We drove
home, and father went immediately to spread the happy news amongst
his friends.All our faithful domestics, including my old affectionate
nurse, were so overjoyed at the news that they danced about like
maniacs.My father was always a very indulgent and liberal master,
furnished his servants with the best of Italian fare, plenty of
fresh beef, wine, and macaroni.We had scarcely got rested, when our
tormenter, the confessor, came into our room and said, "Signoras, what
is the meaning of all this fandango and folly amongst the servants?ARE
THE HERETICS ALL KILLED, that there should be such joy, or has the queen
been delivered of a son, an heir to the throne?"My dear mother was now as pale as death, and silent, for she saw that
the priest was awfully enraged; for, although he feigned to smile, his
smile was similar to that of the hyena when digging his prey out of
the grave.The priest's dark and villainous visage had the effect of
confirming in my mother's mind all the truth regarding the plot to
enslave me for life, and secure all my father's estate to the pockets
of the priests.The confessor was now terribly mad, for two obvious
reasons: one was because he was not received by us with our usual
cordiality and blind affection; the other, because, by the king's
pardon, I was not under the necessity to sacrifice my liberty and
happiness for life to save my father from prison; and what tormented him
the most was, that he believed that I, though young, could understand
and thwart his hellish plans.As my mother trembled and was silent,
fearing the priest was cursing her and her only daughter in his
heart,--for the priests tell such awful stories about the effects of a
priest's curse that the great mass of the Italian people fear it more
than the plague or any earthly misfortune.Peter is the doorkeeper of the great
city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, that he has the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, and has received strict orders not to admit any soul, under
any circumstances, who has been cursed by a holy priest, unless that
curse has been removed by the same priest in the tribunal of penance.I
was obliged to speak to his reverence, and I felt so free, so happy in
Christ as my only hope, that I opened my mind to the priest very freely,
and told him what I thought of him and his plot."Sir priest," said I,
"I shall never return to the convent to stay long.As soon as the time
for my education ends, I shall return to liberty and domestic life.I
am not made of the proper material to make a nun of.I love the social
domestic circle; I love my father and mother, and all our domestics,
even the dogs and the cats, pigeons, and canaries, the fish-ponds,
play-grounds, gardens, rivers, and landscapes, mountain and ocean,--all
the works of God I love.I shall live out of the convent to enjoy these
things; therefore, reverend sir, if you value my peace and good-will,
never speak to me or my parents on the subject of my becoming a nun in
any convent.I shall prefer death to the loss of my personal liberty."I was so decided, and had received such strength and grace from heaven,
that the priest was dumbfounded,--my smooth stone out of the sling
had hit him in the right place.After much effort to appear bland and
good-natured, he drew near my chair, seized my hand, and said, "My dear
daughter, you mistake me.I love you as a daughter, I wish only your
happiness.Your god-father, the holy Bishop, does not intend that you
shall remain a common nun more than a year.After the first year you
shall be raised to the highest dignity in the convent.You shall be the
Lady Superior, and all the nuns shall bow at your feet, and implicitly
obey your commands.Clara is now very old, and his lordship wishes
soon to fill her place.For that purpose he has selected his adopted
daughter.Your talents, education, wealth, and high position in society,
eminently fit you for one of the highest dignities on earth.""A thousand thanks for the kindness of my lord Bishop," said I; "but
your reverence has not altered my mind in the least.I can never bow
down to the feet of any Lady Superior, neither will I ever consent to
see a single human being degraded at my feet.The holy Bible says, 'Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.'"exclaimed the priest, "Where did you see that dangerous
book?Know you not that his holiness the Pope has placed it in the
Index Expurgatorius, because it has been the means of the damnation of
millions of souls?Not because it is in itself a bad book, but because
it is a theological work, prepared only for the priests and ministers of
our holy religion.Therefore, it is always a very dangerous book in
the hands of women or laymen, who wrest the Scriptures to their own
destruction.""Well, reverend sir," I replied, "you seem determined to differ from the
Lord Jesus and his apostles.I read in the New Testament that we should
search the Scriptures because they testify of Christ.And one of the
apostles, I don't remember which, said, 'all scripture is given by the
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for instruction
in righteousness.'Now, reverend sir, if the people have souls, as well
as the priests, why should they not read the word of God which speaks of
Christ and is profitable for instruction?"exclaimed the priest, "and you talk very
much like one."His countenance changed to a pale sickly hue, as he
said, "My daughter, where did you get that dangerous book?If you have,
it in your possession, give it to me, and I will bless you, and pray for
you to the blessed Madonna that she may save you from the infernal pit
of heresy.""I do not own the blessed book," said I, "but I wish I did.I would give
one hundred scudi in gold for a copy of the New Testament.I borrowed a
copy from a friend, and returned it to the owner again.But I understand
that there are copies to be had in London, and when I have a good
opportunity I shall send for a copy, if I can do it unbeknown to any
one.""I shall be in the tribunal of
penance at six o'clock P.M.You need
pardon immediately, and spiritual advice.Should you die as you now are
without absolution, you would be lost and damned forever.I tremble for
you, my dear daughter, seeing that the devil has got such a powerful
hold of you.It may even be absolutely necessary to kill the body to
save your soul; for should you relapse again into heresy after due
penance for this crime has been performed, it would be impossible to
renew you again to repentance, seeing you crucify the Lord and the
Madonna afresh, and put them to an open shame."Here my mother fainted and shook like an aspen leaf.But God gave me
strength, and I said in a moment that as his reverence thought my sins
so great, I would not go to any man, no, not even to the Pope; I
would go to God alone, and leave my cause in his hands, life or death."Therefore, reverend sir, I shall save you from all further trouble in
attending the confessional any more on my account.From henceforth no
earthly power shall drag me alive and with my consent to the tribunal of
penance."exclaimed the priest furiously, "are you mad?There are ten
thousand devils in you, and we must drive them out by some means."After
this discharge of priestly venom, the priest left in a rage giving the
door a terrible slam, which awoke my mother from her sorrowful trance.During the whole conversation, such was the electrical power of the
priest over my mother's weak and nervous system, that if she attempted
to say a word in my behalf, the keen, snakish black eye of the priest
would at once make her tremble and quail before him, and the half
uttered word would remain silent on her lips.The priest went at once
in search of my father.He came home boiling over with rage, saying he
wished I had never been born.The
cause of all this paternal fury upon my poor devoted head was the foul
misrepresentations of my father confessor, who was now in league with
the Bishop, both determined to shut me up in a prison convent, or end my
mortal career.My poor mother remained mute and heart-broken.My sweet mother; never
did she utter one word of unkindness to me; her very look to the last
was one of gentleness and love.But my father loved honor and reputation
amongst men above all other things.The idea of being the father of an
accursed heretic, tormented his pride, and he being suspected of heresy
himself caused him to be forsaken by many of his proud friends and
acquaintances.He was even insulted in the streets by the numerous
Lazaroni, with the epithet of Maldito Corrobonari, so that I lost my
father's love.And when the confessor told him there was no other way
to save me from hell than an entire life of penance in a convent, he
heartily and freely gave his consent.Mother, my own sweet mother, my
only remaining friend, turned as pale as death, but was enabled to say a
word in my behalf.I saw that my earthly doom was sealed; there was not a single voice in
all Naples to save me from imprisonment for life.Not a tongue in four
hundred thousand that would dare speak one word in my behalf.Father
commanded me to get ready to leave his house forever that very night,
saying the carriage and confessor would be on hand to take me away at
eight o'clock P.M., by moonlight.I got on my knees and begged my father
as a last request that he would allow me to remain three days with my
mother, but he refused.Said he, "That is now beyond my power.Not an
hour can you remain after eight o'clock."As I knew not when I should see my Tuscan friend again, I begged the
privilege of seeing her for a few moments.I was anxious to ask her
prayers and sympathy, and to put her on her guard, for should the
priests discover her New Testament, they would punish her as they did
me, or as they intended to do to me.But this favor was denied me, and I
could not write to her, for all letters of the scholars in the
convents, are opened under the pretence to prevent them from receiving
love-letters.The Romish church keeps all her dark plans a secret, but
never allows any secret to be kept from the priests.I went into my room to bid farewell to my home forever.I fell on my
knees and prayed to God for his dear Son's sake to help me, to give me
patience, and to keep me from the sin of suicide.The more I thought
of my utterly unprotected situation and of the savage disposition of my
foes, the priests, the more I thought of the propriety of taking my own
life, rather than live in a dungeon all my days.Such was the power of
superstition over our domestics that they looked upon me as one accursed
of the church, a Protestant heretic, and not one of them would take my
hand or bid me good bye.At tea-time I was not allowed to sit at table
with father, mother, and the confessor, as formerly.But I had my supper
sent up to my room.A short time after the bell rang for vespers, the carriage being ready,
my father and the confessor with myself and one small trunk got into the
best seats inside, and rode off at a rapid rate.I kept my veil over my
face, and said not a word neither did I shed a single tear; my sorrow,
and indignation was too deep for utterance or even for tears.The priest
and my father uttered not a word.Perhaps my father's conscience
made him ashamed of such vile work--that of laying violent hands on a
defenceless girl of eighteen years of age, for no crime whatever, only
the love of liberty and pure Bible religion.But if the priest was
silent, his vile countenance indicated a degree of hellish pleasure and
satisfaction.Never did piratical captain glory more in seeing a rich
prize along side with all hands killed and out of the way, than my
reverend confessor; yet a short time before he said he loved me as a
daughter.Yes, he did love me, as the wolf loves the lamb, as the cat
loves the mouse and as the boa constrictor the beautiful gazelle.To
my momentary satisfaction we entered the big gate of St.Ursula, for
although I knew I should suffer there perhaps even death, there was some
satisfaction in seeing a few faces that I had seen in my gay and happy
days, now alas!I was somewhat grieved by the cold
reception I received.But none
of these things moved me; I looked to God for strength, for I felt that
He alone could nerve me for the conflict.The hardest blow of all was,
my dear father left me at the mercy of the priest without one kind look
or word.He did not even shake hands with me, nor did he say farewell.Oh Popery, what a mysterious power is thine!Thou canst in a few hours
destroy powerful love which it took long years to cement in loving
hearts.When my father had left and I heard the porter lock the heavy
iron gate I felt an exquisite wretchedness come over me.I would have
given worlds for death at that moment.In a few moments the priest rung
a bell, and the old Jezebel the mother Abbess made her appearance."Take
this heretic, Holy Mother, and place her in confinement in the lower
regions; GIVE HER BREAD AND WATER ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE WATER
THAT YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR SACRED FEET IN, NO OTHER; give her straw
to sleep on, but no pillow.Take all her clothing away and give her a
coarse tunic; one single coarse garment to cover her nakedness, but no
shoes.She has grievously sinned against the holy mother church, and now
she mercifully imposes upon her years of severe penance, that her body
of sin may be destroyed and her soul saved after suffering one million
of years in holy purgatory.Our chief duty now, holy mother, in order
to save this lost soul from mortal sin will be to examine her carefully
every, day to ascertain if possible what she most dislikes, or what
is most revolting to her flesh, that whatever it may be, she, must be
compelled to perform it whatever it may cost.Let a holy wax candle burn
in her cell at night, until further orders.And let the Tuscan heretic
be treated in the same way.At
the word "Tuscan heretic," possessing the spirit of Christ that I knew
on earth.Yet how true it is that misery loves company; there was even
satisfaction in being near my unfortunate friend though our sufferings
might be unutterable.Still I was unhappy in the thought that she was
suffering on my account.Had I never said a word about borrowing a New
Testament, she would never have been suspected as being the direct
cause of my conversion to the truth, and of my renunciation of the vile
confessional.I was somewhat puzzled to know what kind of a place was meant by the
lower regions; I had never heard of these regions before.But soon two
women in black habits with their faces entirely covered excepting
two small holes for the eyes to peep through, came to me and without
speaking, made signs for me to follow them.I did so without resistance,
and soon found myself in an under-ground story of the infernal building."There is your cell," said the cowled inquisitors, "look all around, see
every thing, but speak not; no not for your life.The softest whisper
will immediately reach the ears of the Mother Abbess, and then you are
loaded with heavy chains until you die, for there must be no talking
or whispering in this holy retreat of penance.And," said my jailor
further, "take off your clothes, shoes and stockings, and put on this
holy coarse garment which will chafe thy flesh but will bless thy soul.Francis saved many souls by this holy garment."As resistance was worse than useless, I complied, and soon found my poor
feet aching with the cold on the bare stone floor.I was soon made to
feel the blessing of St.My sufferings were
indescribable.It seemed as though ten thousand bees had stung me in
every part.I laid on my
coarse straw and groaned and sighed for death to come and relieve me of
my anguish.As soon as the holy wax candle was left with me I took it
in my hand and went forth to survey my dungeon; but I did not enjoy
my ramble.In one of the cells, I found my Tuscan friend--that dear
Christian sister--in great agony, having had on the accursed garment for
several days.Her body was one entire blister, and very much inflamed.Her bones were racked with pain, as with the most excruciating
inflammatory rheumatism.We recognized each other; she pointed to heaven
as if to say 'trust in the Lord, my sister, our sufferings will soon
be over.'I kissed my hand to her and returned again to my cell.I
saw other victims half dead and emaciated that made my heart sick.I
refrained from speaking to any one for I feared my condition, wretched
as it was, might be rendered even worse, if possible by the fiends who
had entire power over me.said I to myself, "why was I born?O give my soul patience to suffer every pain."On the fourth day of my imprisonment the jailor brought me some water
and soap, a towel, brush and comb, and the same clothes I wore when I
entered the foul den.They told me to make haste and prepare myself to
appear before the holy Bishop.Hope revived in my soul, for I always
thought that my god-father had some regard for me, and had now come to
release me from the foul den I was in.Cold water seemed to afford much
relief to my tortured body.I made my toilet as quick as I could in such
a place.My feet were so numb and swollen that it was difficult for me
to get my shoes on.At last the Bishop arrived as I supposed, and I
was conducted--not into his presence as I expected, but into that of
my bitterest enemy, the confessor.At the very sight of the monster, I
trembled like a reed shaken by the wind.The priest walked to each of
the doors, locked them, put the keys into a small writing desk, locked
it, took out the key and placed it carefully in his sleeve pocket.This
he did to assure me that we were alone, that not one of the inmates
could by any means disturb for the present the holy meditations of the
priest.He bade me take a seat on the sofa by him.In kind soft words he
said to me, that if I was only docile and obedient, he would cause me
to be treated like a princess, and that in a short time I should have
my liberty if I preferred to return to the world.At the same time he
attempted to put his arm around my waist.While he was talking love to me, I was looking at two large alabaster
vases full of beautiful wax flowers; one of them was as much as I could
lift.Without one thought about consequences, I seized the nearest vase
and threw it with all the strength I had at the priest's head.He fell
like a log and uttered one or two groans.It
struck the priest on the right temple, close to the ear.For a moment I
listened to see if any one were coming.I then looked at the priest, and
saw the blood running out of his wound.I quaked with fear lest I had
killed the destroyer of my peace.I did not intend to kill him, I only
wished to stun him, that I might take the keys, open the door and run,
for the back door of the priest's room led right into a back path where
the gates were frequently opened daring the day time.This was about
twelve o'clock, and a most favorable moment for me to escape.In a
moment I had searched the sleeve pocket of the priest, found the key and
a heavy purse of gold which I secured in my dress pocket.I opened the
little writing desk and took out the key to the back door.I saw that
the priest was not dead, and I had not the least doubt from appearances,
but that he would soon come to.I trembled for fear he might wake before
I could get away.I thought of my dear Tuscan sister in her wretched
cell, but I could not get to her without being discovered.I opened the door with the greatest facility and gained
the opening into the back path.I locked the door after me, and brought
the key with me for a short distance, then placed all the keys tinder
a rock.I had no hat but only a black veil.I threw that over my head
after the fashion of Italy and gained the outer gate.There were masons
at work near the gate which was open and I passed through into the
street without being questioned by any one.As I had not a nun's dress on, no one supposed I belonged to the
Institution.I could speak a
few English words which I had learned from some English friends of my
father.Before I got to where the boats lay I saw a gentleman whom I
took to be an English or American gentleman.He had a pleasant face,
looked at me very kindly, saw my pale dejected face and at once felt a
deep sympathy for me.As I appeared to be in trouble and needed help,
he extended his hand to me and said in tolerable good Italian, "Como va'
le' signorina?"that is "How do you do young lady?""Me," said he, "Americano, Americano, capitano de
Bastimento.""Signor Capitano," said I,
"I wish to go on board your ship and see an American ship.""Well," said
he, "with a great deal of pleasure; my ship lies at anchor, my men are
waiting; you shall dine with me, Signorina."I praised God in my soul for this merciful providence of meeting a
friend, though a stranger, whose face seemed to me so honest and so
true.Any condition, even honest slavery, would have been preferred by
me at that time to a convent.The American ship was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw afloat; splendid and neat in all her cabin
arrangements.The mates were polite, and the sailors appeared neat and
happy.Even the black cook showed his beautiful white teeth, as though
he was glad to see one of the ladies of Italy.Little did
they know at that time what peril I was in should I be found out and
taken back to my dungeon again.I informed the captain of my situation,
of having just escaped from a convent into which I had been forced
against my will.I told him I would pay him my passage to America, if
he would hide me somewhere until the ship was well out to sea.He said
I had come just in time, for he was only waiting for a fair wind, and
hoped to be off that evening."I have," said he, "a large number of
bread-casks on board, and two are empty.I shall have you put into one
of these, in which I shall make augur-holes, so that you can have plenty
of fresh air.Down in the hold amongst the provisions you will be safe."I thanked my kind friend and requested him to buy me some needles, silk,
and cotton thread, and some stuff for a couple of dresses, and one-piece
of fine cotton, so that I might make myself comfortable during the
voyage.After I ate my dinner, the men called the captain and said there were
several boats full of soldiers coming to the ship, accompanied by the
priests."Lady," exclaimed the captain, "they are after you.There is
not a moment to be lost.Smith, tell
the men to be careful and not make known that there is a lady on board."I followed my friend quickly, and soon
found myself coiled in a large cask.The captain coopered the head,
which was missing, and made holes for me to get the air; but the
perspiration ran off my face in a stream.Lots of things were piled on
the cask, so that I had hard work to breathe; but such was my fear
of the priests that I would rather have perished in the cask than be
returned to die by inches.The captain had been gone but a short time when I heard steps on deck,
and much noise and confusion.As the hatches were open, I could hear
very distinctly.After the whole company were on deck, the captain
invited the priests and friars, about twenty in number, to walk down to
the cabin, and explain the cause of their visit.They talked through an
interpreter, and said that "a woman of bad character had robbed one of
the churches of a large amount of gold, had attempted to murder one
of the holy priests, but they were happy to say that the holy father,
though badly wounded, was in a fair way of recovery.This woman is
young, but very desperate, has awful raving fits, and has recently
escaped from a lunatic institution.When her fits of madness come on
they are obliged to put her into a straight jacket, for she is the most
dangerous person in Italy.A great reward is offered for her by her
father and the government--five thousand scudi.Is not this enough to
tempt one to help find her?She was seen coming towards the shipping,
and we want the privilege of searching your ship.""Gentlemen," said the captain, "I do not know that the Italian
authorities have any right to search an American ship, under the stars
and stripes of the United States, for we do not allow even the greatest
naval power on earth to do that thing.But if such a mad and dangerous
woman as you have described should by any means have smuggled herself
on board my ship, you are quite welcome to take her away as soon as
possible, for I should be afraid of my life if I was within one hundred
yards of such an unfortunate creature.If you can get her into your
lunatic asylum, the quicker the better; and the five thousand scudi will
come in good time, for I am thinking of building me a larger ship on my
return home.Now, gentlemen, come; I will assist you, for I should like
to see the gold in my pocket."The captain opened all his closets and
secret places, in the cabin and forecastle and in the hold; everything
was searched, all but the identical bread-cask in which I was snugly
coiled.After something like half an hour's search, the soldiers of King
Ferdinand and the priests of King Pope left the ship, satisfied that the
crazy nun was not on board; for, judging the captain by themselves, they
thought he certainly would have given up a mad woman for the sake of
five thousand scudi in gold, and for the safety of his own peace and
comfort.A few moments after the Pope's friends had left, the excellent
benevolent captain came down, and speedily and gently knocking off a
few hoops with a hammer, took the head out, and I was free once more
to breathe God's free air.I lifted my trembling heart in thanksgiving,
while tears of gratitude rolled down my cheeks.Yet, as we were still
within the reach of the guns of the papal forts, my heart was by no
means at rest.But the good captain assured me repeatedly that
all danger was past, for he had twenty-five men on board, all true
Protestants, and he declared that all the priests of Naples would walk
over their dead bodies before they should reach his vessel a second
time."And besides," said the captain, "there are two American
men-of-war in port, who will stand up for the rights of Americans.They
have not yet forgotten Captain Ingraham, of the United States ship
St.Louis, and his rescue from the Austrian <DW7>s of the Hungarian
patriot, Martin Kozsta."The captain wisely refused to purchase any
needles or thread for me on shore, or any articles of ladies' dress,
for fear of the Jesuitical spies, who might surmise something and cause
further trouble.But he kindly furnished me with some goods he had
purchased for his own wife, and there were needles and silk enough on
board, so that I soon cut and made a few articles that made me very
comfortable during our voyage of thirty-two days to London.Early the next morning we sailed out of the beautiful harbor of Naples,
with a fair wind.The beautiful ship seemed to fly over the blue sea.I staid on deck gazing at my native city as long as I could.I thought
then of my once happy home, of my poor, broken-hearted mother, of my
unhappy father.Although he had cast me off through the foul play of
Jesuitical intrigue, my love for my dear father remained the same."Farewell, my dear Italy," I said to myself."When, my poor native land,
wilt thou be happy?Never, never, so long as the Pope lives, and his
wicked, murderous priests, to curse thee by their power."After we got out into the open sea, the motion of the ship made me feel
very sick, and I was so starved out before I came on board, that what
good provisions I ate on board did not seem to agree with me.My stomach
was in a very bad state, for while I was in the lower regions of the
convent I ate only a small quantity of very stale hard bread once in
twenty-four hours, at the ringing of the vesper bells every evening, and
the water given me was that in which the holy Mother Abbess had washed
her sacred feet.But I must give the holy mother credit for one good
omission--she did not use any soap.The captain gave me a good state-room which I occupied with an English
lady passenger.This good lady was accustomed to the sea, therefore, she
did not suffer any inconvenience from sea-sickness; but I was very sick,
so that I kept my berth for five days.This good Protestant lady was
very kind and attentive during the whole passage, and kindly assisted me
in getting my garments made up on board.On our arrival in London, the
captain said that he would sail for America in two weeks time, and very
kindly offered me a free passage to his happy, native land; and I could
not persuade him to take any money for my passage from Naples, nor for
the clothing he had given me.My fellow passenger being wealthy, and well acquainted with people in
England, took me to her splendid home, a few miles from London.At her
residence I was introduced to a young French gentleman, a member of the
Evangelical protestant church in France, and a descendant of the pious
persecuted Huguenots.This gentleman speaks good English and Italian,
having enjoyed the privilege of a superior education.His fervent
prayers at the family altar morning and evening made a very deep
impression on my mind.He became deeply interested in my history, and
offered to take me to France, after I should become his lawful wife.Though I did not like the idea of choosing another popish country for my
residence, yet as my friend assured me that I should enjoy my protestant
religion unmolested, I gave him my hand and my heart.My lady fellow
passenger was my bridesmaid.We were married by a good protestant
minister.My husband is a wealthy merchant--gives me means and
opportunities for doing good.Our
home is one of piety and peace and happiness.The blessed Bible is read
by us every day.Morning and evening we sing God's praise, and call upon
the name of the Lord.Our prayer is that God may deliver beloved France
and Italy from the curse of popery.Another proof of the persecuting spirit of Rome is furnished by the
"Narrative of Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, but who now
'comes forth from Inquisitorial search and torture, and tells us what
he has seen, heard and felt.'"We can make but a few extracts from
this interesting little volume, published by the American and Foreign
Christian Union, who,--to use their own language--"send it forth as a
voice of instruction and warning to the American people.They are not to be set aside by an apology for the
dark ages, nor an appeal to the refinement of the nineteenth century.Here is Rome, not as she WAS in the midnight of the world, but as she
IS at the present moment.There is the same opposition to private
judgment--the same coercive measures--the same cruel persecution--the
same efforts to crush the civil and religious liberties of her own
subjects, for which she has ever been characterized."Ciocci, compelled at an early age to enter the Catholic College--forced,
notwithstanding his deep disgust and earnest remonstrance, to become a
monk--imprisoned--deceived--the victim of priestly artifice and fraud,
at length becomes a Christian.He is of course thrown into a deeper
dungeon; and more exquisite anguish inflicted upon him that he may be
constrained to return to the Romish faith.Of his imprisonment he says,
"We traversed long corridors till we arrived at the door of an apartment
which they requested me to enter, and they themselves retired.On
opening the door I found myself in a close dark room, barely large
enough for the little furniture it contained, which consisted of a small
hard bed, hard as the conscience of an inquisitor, a little table cut
all over, and a dirty ill-used chair.The window which was shut and
barred with iron resisted all my efforts to open it My heart sunk within
me, and I began to cogitate on the destiny in store for me."The Jesuit
Giuliani entering his room, he asked that the window might be opened
for the admission of light and air.Before the words were finished he
exclaimed in a voice of thunder, "How!wretched youth, thou complainest
of the dark, whilst thou art living in the clouds of error?Dost thou
desire the light of heaven, while thou rejectest the light of the
Catholic faith?"Ciocci saw that remonstrance was useless, but he reminded his jailer
that he had been sent there for three days, to receive instruction, not
to be treated as a criminal."For three days," he resumed, counterfeiting my tone of voice, "for
three days!The dainty youth will not forsooth,
be roughly treated; it remains to be seen whether he desires to be
courteously entertained.Fortunate is it for thee that thou art come to this place.THOU WILT
NEVER quit it excepting with the real fruits of repentance!Among these
silent shades canst thou meditate at thy leisure upon the deplorable
state into which thou hast fallen.Woe unto thee, if thou refusest to
listen to the voice of God, who conducts souls into solitude that he
may speak with them.""So saying," he continues, "he abruptly left me.I
remained alone drooping under the weight of a misfortune, which was the
more severe, because totally unexpected.I stood, I know not how long,
in the same position, but on recovering from this lethargy, my first
idea was of flight.Without giving a minute account of the manner
in which I passed my wearisome days and nights in this prison, let it
suffice to say that they were spent in listening to sermons preached to
me four times a day by the fathers Giuliani and Rossini, and in the most
gloomy reflections."In the mean time the miseries I endured were aggravated by the heat of
the season, the wretchedness of the chamber, scantiness of food, and the
rough severity of those by whom I was occasionally visited.Uncertainty
as to when this imprisonment would be at an end, almost drove me wild,
and the first words I addressed to those who approached me were, 'Have
the kindness to tell me when I shall be permitted to leave this place?'One replied, 'My son, think of hell.'I interrogated another; the answer
was, 'Think my son, how terrible is the death of the sinner!'I spoke
to a third, to a fourth, and one said to me, 'My son, what will be your
feeling, if, on the day of judgment you find yourself on the left hand
of God?'the other, 'Paradise, my son, Paradise!'No one gave me a
direct answer; their object appeared to be to mistify and confound me.After the first few days, I began to feel most severely the want of
a change of clothing.Accustomed to cleanliness, I found myself
constrained to wear soiled apparel.* * * For the want of a comb, my
hair became rough and entangled.After the fourth day my portion of food
was diminished; a sign, that they were pressing the siege, that it was
their intention to adopt both assault and blockade--to conquer me by
arms, or induce me to capitulate through hunger.I had been shut up in
this wretched place for thirteen days, when, one day, about noon, the
Father Mislei, the author of all my misery, entered my cell."At the sight of this man, resentment overcame every other
consideration, and I advanced towards him fully prepared to indulge my
feelings, when he, with his usual smile, expressed in bland words
his deep regret at having been the cause of my long detention in this
retreat.'Never could I have supposed,' said he, 'that my anxiety
for the salvation of your soul would have brought you into so much
tribulation.But rest assured the fault is not entirely mine.You have
yourself, in a great degree, by your useless obstinacy, been the cause
of your sufferings.Ah, well, we will yet remedy all.'Not feeling any
confidence in his assurance, I burst out into bitter invectives and
fierce words.He then renewed his protestations, and clothed them with
such a semblance of honesty and truth, that when he ended with this
tender conclusion, 'Be assured, my son, that I love you,' my anger
vanished.* * * I lost sight of the Jesuit, and thought I was addressing
a man, a being capable of sympathising in the distresses of others.'Ah,
well, father,' said I, 'I need some one on whom I can rely, some one
towards whom I can feel kindly; I will therefore place confidence in
your words.'"After some further conversation, Ciocci was asked if
he wished to leave that place.he replied, "what a
strange question!You might as well ask a condemned soul whether he
desires to escape from hell!"At these words the Jesuit started like a
goaded animal, and, forgetting his mission of deceiver, with, knit brows
and compressed lips, he allowed his ferocious soul for one moment
to appear; but, having grown old in deceit, he immediately had the
circumspection to give this movement of rage the appearance of religious
zeal, and exclaimed, "What comparisons are these?Are you not ashamed to
assume the language of the Atheist?By speaking in this way you clearly
manifest how little you deserve to leave this place.But since I have
told you that I love you, I will give you a proof of it by thinking no
more of those irreligious expressions; they shall be forgotten as though
they had never been spoken.Well, the Cardinal proposes to you an easy
way of returning to your monastery.""Here is
the way," said he, presenting me with a paper: "copy this with your
own hand; nothing more will be required of you.""I took the paper with
convulsive eagerness.It was a recantation of my faith, there condemned
as erroneous.* * * Upon reading this, I shuddered, and, starting to my
feet, in a solemn attitude and with a firm voice, exclaimed, 'Kill me,
if you please; my life is in your power; but never will I subscribe
to that iniquitous formulary.'The Jesuit, after laboring in vain
to persuade me to his wishes, went away in anger.I now momentarily
expected to be conducted to the torture.Whenever I was taken from my
room to the chapel, I feared lest some trap-door should open beneath
my feet, and therefore took great care to tread in the footsteps of the
Jesuit who preceded me.No one acquainted with the Inquisition will say
that my precaution was needless.My imagination was so filled with the
horrors of this place, that even in my short, interrupted, and feverish
dreams I beheld daggers and axes glittering around me; I heard the noise
of wheels, saw burning piles and heated irons, and woke in convulsive
terror, only to give myself up to gloomy reflections, inspired by the
reality of my situation, and the impressions left by these nocturnal
visions.What tears did I shed in those dreary moments!How innumerable
were the bitter wounds that lacerated my heart!My prayers seemed to me
unworthy to be received by a God of charity, because, notwithstanding
all my efforts to banish from my soul every feeling of resentment
towards my persecutors, hatred returned with redoubled power.I often
repeated the words of Christ, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what
they do;' but immediately a voice would answer, 'This prayer is not
intended for the Jesuits; they resemble not the crucifiers, who were
blind instruments of the rage of the Jews; while these men are fully
conscious of what they are doing; they are the modern Pharisees.'The
reading of the Bible would have afforded me great consolation, but this
was denied me."* * *

The fourteenth day of his imprisonment he was taken to the council
to hear his sentence, when he was again urged to sign the form of
recantation.The Father Rossini then spoke: "You are
decided; let it be, then, as you deserve.Rebellious son of the church,
in the fullness of the power which she has received from Christ, you
shall feel the holy rigor of her laws.She cannot permit tares to grow
with the good seed.She cannot suffer you to remain among her sons and
become the stumbling-block for the ruin of many.Abandon, therefore,
all hope of leaving this place, and of returning to dwell among the
faithful.KNOW, ALL IS FINISHED FOR YOU!"For the conclusion of this narrative we refer the reader to the volume
itself.If any more evidence were needed to show that the spirit of Romanism is
the same to-day that it has ever been, we find it in the account of
a legal prosecution against ten Christians at Beldac, in France,
for holding and attending a public worship not licensed by the civil
authority.They had made repeated, respectful, and earnest applications
to the prefect of the department of Hante-Vienne for the authorization
required by law, and which, in their case, ought to have been given.They persisted in rendering to God that worship
which his own command and their consciences required.For this they were
arraigned as above stated, on the 10th of August, 1855.On the 26th of
January, 1856, the case was decided by the "tribunal," and the three
pastors and one lady, a schoolmistress, were condemned to pay a fine
of one thousand francs each, and some of the others five-hundred francs
each, the whole amount, together with legal expenditures, exceeding the
sum of nine thousand francs.Meantime, the converts continue to hold their worship-meetings in the
woods, barns, and secret places, in order not to be surprised by the
police commissioner, and to avoid new official reports."Thus, you see," says V. De Pressense, in a letter to the 'American and
foreign Christian Union,' "that we are brought back to the religious
meetings of the desert, when the Protestants of the Cevennes evinced
such persevering fidelity.The only difference is, that these Christians
belonged only a short time ago to that church which is now instigating
persecutions against them."DESTRUCTION OF THE INQUISITION IN SPAIN.Lehmanowsky was attached to the part of Napoleon's army
which was stationed in Madrid.L., "I
used to speak freely among the people what I thought of the Priests
and Jesuits, and of the Inquisition.It had been decreed by the Emperor
Napoleon that the Inquisition and the Monasteries should be suppressed,
but the decree, he said, like some of the laws enacted in this country,
was not executed."Months had passed away, and the prisons of the Inquisition had not been
opened.One night, about ten or eleven o'clock, as he was walking one of
the streets of Madrid, two armed men sprang upon him from an alley, and
made a furious attack.He instantly drew his sword, put himself in a
posture of defence, and while struggling with them, he saw at a distance
the lights of the patrols,--French soldiers mounted, who carried
lanterns, and who rode through the streets of the city at all hours of
the night, to preserve order.He called to them in French, and as they
hastened to his assistance, the assailants took to their heels and
escaped; not, however, before he saw by their dress that they belonged
to the guards of the Inquisition.He went immediately to Marshal Soult, then Governor of Madrid, told him
what had taken place, and reminded him of the decree to suppress this
institution.Marshal Soult told him that he might go and suppress it The
Colonel said that his regiment (the 9th.of the Polish Lancers,) was not
sufficient for such a service, but if he would give him two additional
regiments, the 117th, and another which he named, he would undertake the
work.The 117th regiment was under the command of Col.De Lile, who
is now, like Col.L., a minister of the gospel, and pastor of an
evangelical church in Marseilles, France."The troops required were
granted, and I proceeded," said Col.L., "to the Inquisition which was
situated about five miles from the city.It was surrounded by a wall of
great strength, and defended by a company of soldiers.When we arrived
at the walls, I addressed one of the sentinels, and summoned the holy
fathers to surrender to the Imperial army, and open the gates of the
Inquisition.The sentinel who was standing on the wall, appeared to
enter into conversation with some one within, at the close of which he
presented his musket, and shot one of my men.This was the signal of
attack, and I ordered my troops to fire upon those who appeared on the
walls."It was soon obvious that it was an unequal warfare.The soldiers of the
holy office were partially protected by a breast-work upon the walls
which were covered with soldiers, while our troops were in the open
plain, and exposed to a destructive fire.We had no cannon, nor could
we scale the walls, and the gates successfully resisted all attempts at
forcing them.I could not retire and send for cannon to break through
the walls without giving them time to lay a train for blowing us up.I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed
some trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams.Two
of these were taken up by detachments of men, as numerous as could work
to advantage, and brought to bear upon the walls with all the power they
could exert, while the troops kept up a fire to protect them from the
fire poured upon them from the walls.Presently the walls began to
tremble, a breach was made, and the Imperial troops rushed into the
Inquisition.Here we met with an incident, which nothing but Jesuitical
effrontery is equal to.The Inquisitor General, followed by the father
confessors in their priestly robes, all came out of their rooms, as we
were making our way into the interior of the Inquisition, and with long
faces, and arms crossed over their breasts, their fingers resting on
their shoulders, as though they had been deaf to all the noise of
the attack and defence, and had just learned what was going on, they
addressed themselves in the language of rebuke to their own soldiers,
saying, "WHY DO YOU FIGHT OUR FRIENDS, THE FRENCH?"Their intention, no doubt, was to make us think that this defence was
wholly unauthorized by them, hoping, if they could make us believe
that they were friendly, they should have a better opportunity, in the
confusion of the moment, to escape.Their artifice was too shallow, and
did not succeed.I caused them to be placed under guard, and all
the soldiers of the Inquisition to be secured as prisoners.We then
proceeded to examine all the rooms of the stately edifice.We passed
through room after room; found all perfectly in order, richly furnished,
with altars and crucifixes, and wax candles in abundance, but we could
discover no evidences of iniquity being practiced there, nothing of
those peculiar features which we expected to find in an Inquisition.We found splendid paintings, and a rich and extensive library.Here was
beauty and splendor, and the most perfect order on which my eyes
had ever rested.The
ceilings and floors of wood were scoured and highly polished.The marble
floors were arranged with a strict regard to order.There was everything
to please the eye and gratify a cultivated taste; but where were those
horrid instruments of torture, of which we had been told, and where
those dungeons in which human beings were said to be buried alive?The holy father assured us that they had been
belied; that we had seen all; and I was prepared to give up the search,
convinced that this Inquisition was different from others of which I had
heard.De Idle was not so ready as myself to give up the search, and
said to me, "Colonel, you are commander to-day, and as you say, so it
must be; but if you will be advised by me, let this marble floor be
examined.Let water be brought and poured upon it, and we will watch
and see if there is any place through which it passes more freely than
others."I replied to him, "Do as you please, Colonel," and ordered
water to be brought accordingly.The slabs of marble were large and
beautifully polished.When the water had been poured over the floor,
much to the dissatisfaction of the inquisitors, a careful examination
was made of every seam in the floor, to see if the water passed through.De Lile exclaimed that he had found it.By the side of
one of these marble slabs the water passed through fast, as though
there was an opening beneath.All hands were now at work for further
discovery; the officers with their swords and the soldiers with their
bayonets, seeking to clear out the seam, and pry up the slab; others
with the butts of their muskets striking the slab with all their might
to break it, while the priests remonstrated against our desecrating
their holy and beautiful house.While thus engaged, a soldier, who was
striking with the butt of his musket, struck a spring, and the marble
slab flew up.Then the faces of the inquisitors grew pale as Belshazzar
when the hand writing appeared on the wall; they trembled all over;
beneath the marble slab, now partly up, there was a stair-case.I
stepped to the altar, and took from the candlestick one of the candles
four feet in length, which was burning that I might explore the room
below.As I was doing this, I was arrested by one of the inquisitors,
who laid his hand gently on my arm, and with a very demure and holy look
said "My son, you must not take those lights with your bloody hands they
are holy.""Well," said I, "I will take a holy thing to shed light
on iniquity; I will bear the responsibility."I took the candle, and
proceeded down the stair-case.As we reached the foot of the stairs
we entered a large room which was called the hall of judgment.In the
centre of it was a large block, and a chain fastened to it.On this they
were accustomed to place the accused, chained to his seat.On one side
of the room was an elevated seat called the Throne of Judgment.This,
the Inquisitor General occupied, and on either side were seats less
elevated, for the holy fathers when engaged in the solemn business of
the Holy Inquisition.From this room we proceeded to the right, and obtained access to small
cells extending the entire length of the edifice; and here such sights
were presented as we hoped never to see again.Three cells were places
of solitary confinement, where the wretched objects of inquisitorial
hate were confined year after year, till death released them from their
sufferings, and their bodies were suffered to remain until they were
entirely decayed, and the rooms had become fit for others to occupy.To prevent this being offensive to those who occupied the Inquisition,
there were flues or tubes extending to the open air, sufficiently
capacious to carry off the odor.In these cells we found the remains
of some who had paid the debt of nature: some of them had been dead
apparently but a short time, while of others nothing remained but their
bones, still chained to the floor of their dungeon.In others we found living sufferers of both sexes and of every age, from
three score years and ten down to fourteen or fifteen years--all naked
as they were born into the world!Here were old men
and aged women, who had been shut up for many years.Here, too, were the
middle aged, and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old.The soldiers immediately went to work to release the captives from
their chains, and took from their knapsacks their overcoats and
other clothing, which they gave to cover their nakedness.They were
exceedingly anxious to bring them out to the light of day; but Col.L., aware of the danger, had food given them, and then brought them
gradually to the light, as they were able to bear it.L., to explore another room on the left.Here we found the instruments of torture, of every kind which the
ingenuity of men or devils could invent.L., here described four
of these horrid instruments.The first was a machine by which the victim
was confined, and then, beginning with the fingers, every joint in the
hands, arms and body, were broken or drawn one after another, until the
victim died.The second was a box, in which the head and neck of the
victim were so closely confined by a screw that he could not move in any
way.Over the box was a vessel, from which one drop of water a second,
fell upon the head of the victim;--every successive drop falling upon
precisely the same place on the head, suspended the circulation in a few
moments, and put the sufferer in the most excruciating agony.The third
was an infernal machine, laid horizontally, to which the victim was
bound; the machine then being placed between two beams, in which were
scores of knives so fixed that, by turning the machine with a crank, the
flesh of the sufferer was torn from his limbs, all in small pieces.The
fourth surpassed the others in fiendish ingenuity.Its exterior was
a beautiful woman, or large doll, richly dressed, with arms extended,
ready, to embrace its victim.Around her feet a semi-circle was drawn.The victim who passed over this fatal mark, touched a spring which
caused the diabolical engine to open; its arms clasped him, and a
thousand knives cut him into as many pieces in the deadly embrace.L., said that the sight of these engines of infernal cruelty kindled the
rage of the soldiers to fury.They declared that every inquisitor and
soldier of the inquisition should be put to the torture.They might have turned their
arms against him if he had attempted to arrest their work.The first they put to death in the machine for
breaking joints.The torture of the inquisitor put to death by the
dropping of water on his head was most excruciating.The poor man cried
out in agony to be taken from the fatal machine.The inquisitor general
was brought before the infernal engine called "The Virgin.""No" said they, "you have caused others to kiss her, and
now you must do it."They interlocked their bayonets so as to form large
forks, and with these pushed him over the deadly circle.The beautiful
image instantly prepared for the embrace, clasped him in its arms,
and he was cut into innumerable pieces.L. said, he witnessed the
torture of four of them--his heart sickened at the awful scene--and he
left the soldiers to wreak their vengeance on the last guilty inmate of
that prison-house of hell.In the mean time it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the
Inquisition were broken open, and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot.And, Oh, what a meeting was there!About a
hundred who had been buried for many years were now restored to life.There were fathers who had found their long lost daughters; wives were
restored to their husbands, sisters to their brothers, parents to their
children; and there were some who could recognize no friend among the
multitude.The scene was such as no tongue can describe.L. caused the library, paintings,
furniture, etc., to be removed, and having sent to the city for a wagon
load of powder, he deposited a large quantity in the vaults beneath
the building, and placed a slow match in connection with it.All had
withdrawn to a distance, and in a few moments there was a most joyful
sight to thousands.The walls and turrets of the massive structure rose
majestically towards the heavens, impelled by the tremendous explosion,
and fell back to the earth an immense heap of ruins.Lehmanowsky of the destruction of the
inquisition in Spain.Was it then finally destroyed, never again to be
revived?Giacinto Achilli, D. D.
Surely, his statements in this respect can be relied upon, for he is
himself a convert from Romanism, and was formerly the "Head Professor of
Theology, and Vicar of the Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace."He certainly had every opportunity to obtain correct information on the
subject, and in a book published by him in 1851, entitled "Dealings
with the Inquisition," we find, (page 71) the following startling
announcement."We are now in the middle of the nineteenth century, and
still the Inquisition is actually and potentially in existence.This
disgrace to humanity, whose entire history is a mass of atrocious
crimes, committed by the priests of the Church of Rome, in the name of
God and of His Christ, whose vicar and representative, the pope, the
head of the Inquisition, declares himself to be,--this abominable
institution is still in existence in Rome and in the Roman States."Again, (page 89) he says, "And this most infamous Inquisition, a hundred
times destroyed and as often renewed, still exists in Rome as in the
barbarous ages; the only difference being that the same iniquities are
at present practiced there with a little more secrecy and caution than
formerly, and this for the sake of prudence, that the Holy See may not
be subjected to the animadversions of the world at large."On page 82 of the same work we find the following language."I do not
propose to myself to speak of the Inquisition of times past, but of what
exists in Rome at the present moment; I shall therefore assert that the
laws of this institution being in no respect changed, neither can the
institution itself be said to have undergone any alteration.The present
race of priests who are now in power are too much afraid of the popular
indignation to let loose all their inquisitorial fury, which might even
occasion a revolt if they were not to restrain it; the whole world,
moreover, would cry out against them, a crusade would be raised against
the Inquisition, and, for a little temporary gratification, much power
would be endangered.This is the true reason why the severity of its
penalties is in some degree relaxed at the present time, but they still
remain unaltered in its code."Again on page 102, he says, "Are the torments which are employed at the
present day at the Inquisition all a fiction?It requires the impudence
of an inquisitor, or of the Archbishop of Westminister to deny their
existence.I have myself heard these evil-minded persons lament and
complain that their victims were treated with too much lenity.I inquired of the inquisitor of Spoleto.Thomas Aquinas says," answered he; "DEATH TO ALL THE
HERETICS.""Hand over, then, to one of these people, a person, however respectable;
give him up to one of the inquisitors, (he who quoted St.Thomas Aquinas
to me was made an Archbishop)--give up, I say, the present Archbishop of
Canterbury, an amiable and pious man, to one of these rabid inquisitors;
he must either deny his faith or be burned alive.Is not this the spirit that invariably actuates the
inquisitors?and not the inquisitors only, but all those who in any
way defile themselves with the inquisition, such as bishops and their
vicars, and all those who defend it, as the <DW7>s do.Wiseman, the Archbishop of Westminster according to the
pope's creation, the same who has had the assurance to censure me from
his pulpit, and to publish an infamous article in the Dublin Review, in
which he has raked together, as on a dunghill, every species of filth
from the sons of Ignatius Loyola; and there is no lie or calumny that he
has not made use of against me.Well, then, suppose I were to be handed
over to the tender mercy of Dr.Wiseman, and he had the full power to
dispose of me as he chose, without fear of losing his character in
the eyes of the nation to which, by parentage more than by merit, he
belongs, what do you imagine he would do with me?Should I not have to
undergo some death more terrible than ordinary?Would not a council be
held with the reverend fathers of the company of Loyola, the same who
have suggested the abominable calumnies above alluded to, in order
to invent some refined method of putting me out of the world?I feel
persuaded that if I were condemned by the Inquisition to be burned
alive, my calumniator would have great pleasure in building my funeral
pile, and setting fire to it with his own hands; or should strangulation
be preferred, that he would, with equal readiness, arrange the cord
around my neck; and all for the honor and glory of the Inquisition, of
which, according to his oath, he is a true and faithful servant."Achilli is the spirit of Romanism!Can we
doubt that it would lead to results as frightful as anything described
in the foregoing story?But let us listen to his further remarks on the present state of the
Inquisition.On page 75 he says, "What, then, is the Inquisition of the
nineteenth century?The same system of intolerance which prevailed in
the barbarous ages.That which raised the Crusade and roused all Europe
to arms at the voice of a monk [Footnote: Bernard of Chiaravalle.]and
of a hermit, [Footnote: Peter the Hermit.]That which--in the name of
a God of peace, manifested on earth by Christ, who, through love
for sinners, gave himself to be crucified--brought slaughter on the
Albigenses and the Waldenses; filled France with desolation, under
Domenico di Guzman; raised in Spain the funeral pile and the scaffold,
devastating the fair kingdoms of Granada and Castile, through the
assistance of those detestable monks, Raimond de Pennefort, Peter
Arbues, and Cardinal Forquemorda.That, which, to its eternal infamy,
registers in the annals of France the fatal 24th of August, and the 5th
of November in those of England."That same system which at this moment flourishes at Rome, which has
never yet been either worn out or modified, and which at this present
time, in the jargon of the priests, is called a "the holy, Roman,
universal, apostolic Inquisition.Holy, as the place where Christ was
crucified is holy; apostolic, because Judas Iscariot was the first
inquisitor; Roman and universal, because FROM ROME IT EXTENDS OVER ALL
THE WORLD.It is denied by some that the Inquisition which exists in
Rome as its centre, is extended throughout the world by means of the
missionaries.The Roman Inquisition and the Roman Propaganda are in
close connection with each other.Every bishop who is sent in partibus
infidelium, is an inquisitor charged to discover, through the means of
his missionaries, whatever is said or done by others in reference to
Rome, with the obligation to make his report secretly.The Apostolic
nuncios are all inquisitors, as are also the Apostolic vicars.Here,
then, we see the Roman Inquisition extending to the most remote
countries."Again this same writer informs us, (page 112,) that "the
principal object of the Inquisition is to possess themselves, by
every means in their power, of the secrets of every class of society.Consequently its agents (Jesuits and Missionaries,) enter the domestic
circle, observe every motion, listen to every conversation, and would,
if possible, become acquainted with the most hidden thoughts.It is in
fact, the police, not only of Rome, but of all Italy; INDEED, IT MAY BE
SAID OF THE WHOLE WORLD."Achilli are fully corroborated by the Rev.In a book published by him in 1852, entitled
"The Brand of Dominic," we find the following remarks in relation to the
Inquisition of the present time.The Roman Inquisition is, therefore,
acknowledged to have an infinite multitude of affairs constantly on
hand, which necessitates its assemblage thrice every week.Still there
are criminals, and criminal processes.The body of officials are still
maintained on established revenues of the holy office.So far from any
mitigation of severity or judicial improvement in the spirit of its
administration, the criminal has now no choice of an advocate; but one
person, and he a servant of the Inquisition, performs an idle ceremony,
under the name of advocacy, for the conviction of all.And let the
reader mark, that as there are bishops in partibus, so, in like manner,
there are inquisitors of the same class appointed in every country, and
chiefly, in Great Britain and the colonies, who are sworn to secrecy,
and of course communicate intelligence to this sacred congregation of
all that can be conceived capable of comprehension within the infinitude
of its affairs.We must, therefore, either believe that the court
of Rome is not in earnest, and that this apparatus of universal
jurisdiction is but a shadow,--an assumption which is contrary to all
experience,--or we must understand that the spies and familiars of the
Inquisition are listening at our doors, and intruding themselves on our
hearths.How they proceed, and what their brethren at Rome are doing,
events may tell; BUT WE MAY BE SURE THEY ARE NOT IDLE.They were not idle in Rome in 1825, when they rebuilt the prisons of
the Inquisition.They were not idle in 1842, when they imprisoned Dr.Achilli for heresy, as he assures us; nor was the captain, or some other
of the subalterns, who, acting in their name, took his watch from him
as he came out.They were not idle in 1843, when they renewed the old
edicts against the Jews.And all the world knows that the inquisitors on
their stations throughout the pontifical states, and the inquisitorial
agents in Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, were never more active
than during the last four years, and even at this moment, when every
political misdemeanor that is deemed offensive to the Pope, is,
constructively, a sin against the Inquisition, and visited with
punishment accordingly.A deliberative body, holding formal session
thrice every week, cannot be idle, and although it may please them to
deny that Dr.Achilli saw and examined a black book, containing the
praxis now in use, the criminal code of inquisitors in force at this
day,--as Archibald Bower had an abstract of such a book given him for
his use about one hundred and thirty years ago,--they cannot convince
me that I have not seen and handled, and used in the preparation of this
volume, the compendium of an unpublished Roman code of inquisitorial
regulations, given to the vicars of the inquisitor-general of Modena.They may be pleased to say that the mordacchia, or gag, of which Dr.Achilli speaks, as mentioned in that BLACK BOOK, is no longer used;
but that it is mentioned there, and might be used again is more than
credible to myself, after having seen that the "sacred congregation" has
fixed a rate of fees for the ordering, witnessing, and administration of
TORTURE.There was indeed, a talk of abolishing torture at Rome; but
we have reason to believe that the congregation will not drop the
mordacchia, inasmuch, as, instead of notifying any such reformation to
the courts of Europe, this congregation has kept silence.For although a
continuation of the bullary has just been published at Rome, containing
several decrees of this congregation, there is not one that announces
a fulfilment of this illusory promise,--a promise imagined by a
correspondent to French newspapers, but never given by the inquisitors
themselves.And as there is no proof that they have yet abstained from
torture, there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence that they
have delighted themselves in death.When public burnings
became inexpedient--as at Goa--did they not make provision for private
executions?For a third time at least the Roman prisons--I am not speaking of those
of the provinces--were broken open, in 1849, after the desertion of Pius
IX., and two prisoners were found there, an aged bishop and a nun.Many persons in Rome reported the event; but instead of copying what is
already before the public, I translate a letter addressed to me by P.
Alessandro Gavazzi, late chaplain-general of the Roman army, in reply
to a few questions which I had put to him.All who have heard his
statements may judge whether his account of facts be not marked with
every note of accuracy.They will believe that his power of oratory DOES
NOT betray him into random declamation.Under date of March 20th, 1852,
he writes thus:

"MY DEAR SIR,--In answering your questions concerning the palace of
Inquisition at Rome, I should say that I can give only a few superficial
and imperfect notes.So short was the time that it remained open to the
public, So great the crowd of persons that pressed to catch a sight of
it, and so intense the horror inspired by that accursed place, that I
could not obtain a more exact and particular impression."I found no instruments of torture, [Footnote: "The gag, the
thumb-screw, and many other instruments of severe torture could be
easily destroyed and others as easily procured.The non-appearance of
instruments is not enough to sustain the current belief that the use of
them is discontinued.So long as there is a secret prison, and while
all the existing standards of inquisitorial practice make torture
an ordinary expedient for extorting information, not even a bull,
prohibiting torture, would be sufficient to convince the world that
it has been discontinued.The practice of falsehood is enjoined on
inquisitors.How, then, could we believe a bull, or decree, if it were
put forth to-morrow, to release them from suspicion, or to screen them
from obloquy?It would not be entitled to belief."--Rev.for they were destroyed at the time of the first French invasion,
and because such instruments were not used afterwards by the modern
Inquisition.I did, however, find, in one of the prisons of the second
court, a furnace, and the remains of a woman's dress.I shall never be
able to believe that that furnace was placed there for the use of the
living, it not being in such a place, or of such a kind, as to be of
service to them.Everything, on the contrary, combines to persuade me
that it was made use of for horrible deaths, and to consume the remains
of the victims of inquisitorial executions.Another object of horror I
found between the great hall of judgment and the luxurious apartment of
the chief jailer (primo custode), the Dominican friar who presides over
this diabolical establishment.This was a deep trap or shaft opening
into the vaults under the Inquisition.As soon as the so-called criminal
had confessed his offence; the second keeper, who is always a Dominican
friar, sent him to the father commissary to receive a relaxation
[Footnote: "In Spain, RELAXATION is delivery to death.In the
established style of the Inquisition it has the same meaning.But in the
common language of Rome it means RELEASE.In the lips of the inquisitor,
therefore, if he used the word, it has one meaning, and another to the
ear of the prisoner."--Rev.With the
hope of pardon, the confessed culprit would go towards the apartment of
the holy inquisitor; but in the act of setting foot at its entrance,
the trap opened, and the world of the living heard no more of him.I
examined some of the earth found in the pit below this trap; it was a
compost of common earth, rottenness, ashes, and human hair, fetid to the
smell, and horrible to the sight and to the thought of the beholder."But where popular fury reached its highest pitch was in the vaults of
St.Pius V. I am anxious that you should note well that this pope was
canonized by the Roman church especially for his zeal against heretics.I will now describe to you the manner how, and the place where, those
vicars of Jesus Christ handled the living members of Jesus Christ, and
show you how they proceeded for their healing.You descend into the
vaults by very narrow stairs.A narrow corridor leads you to the
several cells, which, for smallness and stench, are a hundred times more
horrible than the dens of lions and tigers in the Colosseum.Wandering
in this labyrinth of most fearful prisons, that may be called 'graves
for the living,' I came to a cell full of skeletons without skulls,
buried in lime, and the skulls, detached from the bodies, had been
collected in a hamper by the first visitors.and why were they buried in that place and in that manner?I have heard
some popish priests trying to defend the Inquisition from the charge of
having condemned its victims to a secret death, say that the palace of
the Inquisition was built on a burial-ground, belonging anciently to a
hospital for pilgrims, and that the skeletons found were none other
than those of pilgrims who had died in that hospital.But everything
contradicts this papistical defence.Suppose that there had been a
cemetery there, it could not have had subterranean galleries and
cells, laid out with so great regularity; and even if there had been
such--against all probability--the remains of bodies would have been
removed on laying the foundation of the palace, to leave the space free
for the subterranean part of the Inquisition.Besides, it is contrary to
the use of common tombs to bury the dead by carrying them through a door
at the side; for the mouth of the sepulchre is always at the top.And
again, it has never been the custom in Italy to bury the dead singly in
quick lime; but, in time of plague, the dead bodies have been usually
laid in a grave until it was sufficiently full, and then quick lime has
been laid over them, to prevent pestilential exhalations, by hastening
the decomposition of the infected corpses.This custom was continued,
some years ago, in the cemeteries of Naples, and especially in the daily
burial of the poor.Therefore, the skeletons found in the Inquisition
of Rome could not belong to persons who had died a natural death in
a hospital; nor could any one, under such a supposition, explain the
mystery of all the bodies being buried in lime except the head.It
remains, then, beyond a doubt, that that subterranean vault contained
the victims of one of the many secret martyrdoms of the butcherly
tribunal.The following is the most probable opinion, if it be not
rather the history of a fact:

"The condemned were immersed in a bath of slaked lime, gradually filled
up to their necks.The lime by little and little enclosed the sufferers,
or walled them up alive.As the lime
rose higher and higher, the respiration became more and more painful,
because more difficult.So that what with the suffocation of the smoke,
and the anguish of the compressed breathing, they died in a manner most
horrible and desperate.Some time after their death the heads would
naturally separate from the bodies, and roll away into the hollows made
by the shrinking of the lime.Any other explanation of the feet that may
be attempted will be found improbable and unnatural.You may make what
use you please of these notes of mine, since I can warrant their
truth.I wish that writers, speaking of this infamous tribunal of the
Inquisition, would derive their information from pure history, unmingled
with romance; for so great and so many the historical atrocities of the
Inquisition, that they would more than suffice to arouse the detestation
of a thousand worlds.I know that the popish impostor-priests go about
saying that the Inquisition was never an ecclesiastical tribunal, but
a laic.But you will have shown the contrary in your work, and may also
add, in order quite to unmask these lying preachers, that the palace
of the Inquisition at Rome is under the shadow of the palace of the
Vatican; that the keepers are to this day, Dominican friars; and that
the prefect of the Inquisition at Rome is the Pope in person."I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,

"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the
palace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction
of that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument
could be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored
the Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,

to the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of
St.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar
delinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of
January, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential
representations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as
a soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving
the authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed
they first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it
expedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any
Inquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the
truth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their
hands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the
SECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation
of their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude
without the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of
this country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its
daily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should
fancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him
hear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,
a document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,
condemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having
taken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING
COLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE
CONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently
as March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed
four cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy
Roman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that
provision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in
partibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,
their vacant seats are filled by others.The 'immortal legion' is
punctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our
brethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm
to, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,
let it be observed;

"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That
letters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is
equally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of
Rome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some
particular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his
character of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It
cannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and
aggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are
less active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We
also see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della
Genga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added
to it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is
both in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, 'natural Inquisitors,'
as they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these
natural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the
Inquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed
to supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since
the bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best
command, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they
act in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that
there is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance
exercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with
education, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable
relations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors
in partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or
familiars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,
and to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond
the reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,
not rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or
individual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors
in partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of
murderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,
it is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial
secrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only
visible to the eye of God, and to those'most reverend and most eminent'
guardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva
and Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the
heretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on 'the faithful'
of realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those
'religious houses,' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,
unfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,
the surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline
exacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal
discipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn
to Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not
'relaxed' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal
practices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or
decoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the
universal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some
tales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions
have taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the
Inquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they
provide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year's end to year's
end, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of
Englishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much
evil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of
this fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold
the cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only
counteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an
evil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the
following vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the
whole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and
nuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives
back its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly
mapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of
telegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in
South Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,
to which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It
is through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,
that the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well
nigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a
free, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple
shepherd's sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa's brook, God
will give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its
dark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass
through fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of
the Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are
all as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men's bones.They
call it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed
pilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of
their father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown
into the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of
this diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven
knows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This
kind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of
compelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death
for their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,
quoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is
England, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a
careful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal
force to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is
it true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is
unchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every
nuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even
now, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be
found in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,
in Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from
Romanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence
when speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the
Jesuits?The idea that we have aught
to fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow
me to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the
Madeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and
not only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many
of the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished
the Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to
whom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in
this great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard
for their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through
the advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected
the Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic
operations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who
distinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible
religion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for
popish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their
sect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the
church.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was
rewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop's mitre, for his great,
zeal and success, in removing God's Holy Bible from thirty-eight public
schools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to
examine every book in the hands of American children in the public
schools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history
unpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing
to do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in
the United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is
to us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The
American people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A
RELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the
fallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,
because they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man
of sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known
by its fruit, such as 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;' and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving
to God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does
the tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,
and respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he
fled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United
States, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He
says, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied
in business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the
miseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in
this free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been
duped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female
convents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a
friend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who
is always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the
Bishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of
redress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and
suffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may
have a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew
one-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to
see her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor
attached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the
most unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend
the confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand
cross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their
minds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature
of the priest's, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any
friends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her
fate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the
dear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up
to heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly
relative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives
with a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,
their disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her
friends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How
amazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of
religion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO

In a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find
the following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary
in Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most
worthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the
country, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,
in Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The
admittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a
bride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,
beside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most
solemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh
and spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter
mansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off
her rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and
brilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to
fifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are
submitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the
world, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in
which she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre
walls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are
shut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,
if ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends
or The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or
devoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If
ever allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot
be seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint
escapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the
sound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to
pour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of
her heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer
its own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant
relief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her
tomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator
of all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient
and unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are
not allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, 'Que morir
tenemos, 'we are to die,' or 'we must die,' and to reply, 'Ya los
sabemos,' 'we know it,' or 'already we know it'

"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in
a narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without
bed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their
daily dress is their only covering.'Tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions
lights on his unsullied with a tear:' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
they are aroused by the bell to perform their 'Ave Maria's,' count their
rosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they
drag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its
last account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within
the walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed
sister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative
of facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by
almost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of 'perfecting the
saints,' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass
and adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in
lockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the
ignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO
SELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, 'without money
and without price?'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female
to incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in
pieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of
this city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of
course, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this
perfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to
cut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich
diamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,
diabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in
all lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the
'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,' especially that part of it relating to these
secret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,
"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence
here and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not
show the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in
countries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of
our government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,
which holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But
they constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with
the interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable
circumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have
inflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few
Protestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of
no crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut
up in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate
when entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,
very few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our
people have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus
manifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension
of the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in
the construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are
revealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection
with things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be
lost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in
legislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same
talented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants
should lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in
respect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to
call to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences
from the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the
inheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their
children free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they
received it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that
what she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here
when fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving
about everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and
convents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have
served as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show
that she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of
Protestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults
are made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions
and interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly
clamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and
political creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and
to renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and
children's children, should lose no time in informing themselves of
the state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its
institutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and
influence to the protection of the country against those Popish
establishments and their usages which have been set up among us without
the authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the
nations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now
but little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which
Mexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of
recovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in
the mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in
the neighborhood under the names of'schools,''retreats','religions
communities,' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or
are not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are
situated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and
forwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be
subjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which
all Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible
institutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist
upon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the
words of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon
delivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its
anniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, 'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?'It is not against the unhappy millions that are
ground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of
the common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like
ourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would
grant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have
no animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the
coming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and
live, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to
oppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue
cleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible
power on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,
sir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for
we would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has
inspired.'A tirade against Romanism,' is it?O sir, we remember
the persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish
Inquisition; we remember the reign of 'the Bloody Mary;' we remember
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;
we remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we
remember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along
the ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the
islanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these
shores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to
propagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further
vigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade
and all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of
that great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never
be hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of
Farel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the
trumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three
hundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children
of the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal
weapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of
truth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST
FALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the
coming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS
ANTICHRIST MUST FALL."Also, the Berber historian, Ebn-Khal-Doun, who
flourished in the fourteenth century, makes all the Berbers descend from
one Bar, the son of Mayigh, son of Canaan.However, what may be the
truths of these traditions of Sallust or Procopius, there is no
difficulty in believing that North Africa was peopled by fugitive and
roving tribes, and that the first settlers should be exposed to be
plundered by succeeding hordes; for such has been the history of the
migrations of all the tribes of the human race.But the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend is, the
invasion, or more properly, the successive invasions of North Africa by
the Phoenicians.Their definite establishment on these shores took place
towards the foundation of Carthage, about 820 years before our era.Yet
we know little of their intercourse or relations with the aboriginal
tribes.When the Romans, a century and a half before Christ, received,
or wrested, the rule of Africa from the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians,
they found before them an indigenous people, whom they indifferently
called Moors, Berbers, or Barbarians.A part of these people were called
also Nudides, which is perhaps considered the same term as nomades.Some ages later, the Romans, too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of
other conquerors, were subjugated by the Vandals, who, during a century,
held possession of North Africa; but, after this time, the Romans again
raised their heads, and completely expelled or extirpated the Vandals,
so that, as before, there were found only two people or races in Africa:
the Romans and the Moors, or aborigines.Towards the middle of the seventh century after Christ, and a few years
after the death of Mahomet, the Romans, in the decline of their power,
had to meet the shock of the victorious arms of the Arabians, who poured
in upon them triumphant from the East; but, too weak to resist this new
tide of invasion, they opposed to them the aborigines, which latter were
soon obliged to continue alone the struggle.The Arabian historians, who recount these wars, speak of _Roumi_ or
Romans (of the Byzantine empire) and the Braber--evidently the
aboriginal tribes--who promptly submitted to the Arabs to rid themselves
of the yoke of the Romans; but, after the retreat of their ancient
masters, they revolted and remained a long time in arms against their
new conquerors--a rule of action which all subjugated nations have been
wont to follow.Were we English now to attempt to expel the French from
Algeria, we, undoubtedly, should be joined by the Arabs; but who would,
most probably, soon also revolt against us, were we to attempt to
consolidate our dominion over them.In the first years of the eighth century, and at the end of the first
century of the Hegira, the conquering Arabs passed over to Spain, and,
inasmuch as they came from Mauritania, the people of Spain gave them the
name of Moors (that of the aborigines of North Africa), although they
had, perhaps, nothing in common with them, if we except their Asiatic
origin.Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab
warriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose
etymology is extremely obscure.[13] From this time the Spaniards have
always given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of
Spain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two
denominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of
Morocco and those in the environs of Senegal.The Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of
Asia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into
Ismaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is
considered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption
of the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet.A second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an
epoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat
of his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending in the complete
submission of Morocco to the power of Yousef Ben Tashfin.One cannnot
now distinguish which tribe of Arabs belong to the first or the second
invasion, but all who can shew the slightest proof, claim to belong to
the first, as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warriors.After eight centuries of rule, the Arabs being expelled from Spain, took
refuge in Barbary, but instead of finding the hospitality and protection
of their brethren, the greater part of them were pillaged or massacred.The remnant of these wretched fugitives settled along the coast; and it
is to their industry and intelligence that we owe the increase, or the
foundation of many of the maritime cities.Here, considered as strangers
and enemies by the natives, whom they detested, the new colonists sought
for, and formed relations with Turks and renegades of all nations,
whilst they kept themselves separate from the Arabs and Berbers.This,
then, is the _bona-fide_ origin of the people whom we now generally call
Moors.History furnishes us with a striking example of how the expelled
Arabs of Spain united with various adventurers against the Berber and
North African Arabs.In the year 1500, a thousand Andalusian cavaliers,
who had emigrated to Algiers, formed an alliance with the Barbarossas
and their fleet of pirates; and, after expelling the native prince,
built the modern city of Algiers.And such was the origin of the
Algerine Corsairs.The general result of these observations would, therefore, lead us to
consider the Moors of the Romans, as the Berbers or aborigines of North
Africa, and the Moors of the Spaniards, as pure Arabians; and if,
indeed, these Arabian cavaliers marshalled with them Berbers, as
auxiliaries, for the conquest of Spain, this fact does not militate
against the broad assumption.The so-called Moors of Senegal and the Sahara, as well as those of
Morocco, are chiefly a mixture of Berbers, Arabs and <DW64>s; but the
present Moors located in the northern coast of Africa, are rather the
descendants from the various conquering nations, and especially from
renegades and Christian slaves.The term Moors is not known to the natives themselves.The people speak
definitely enough of Arabs and of various Berber tribes.The population
of the towns and cities are called generally after the names of these
towns and cities, whilst Tuniseen and Tripoline is applied to all the
inhabitants of the great towns of Tunis and Tripoli.Europeans resident
in Barbary, as a general rule, call all the inhabitants of towns--Moors,
and the peasants or people residents in tents--Arabs.But, in Tripoli, I
found whole villages inhabited by Arabs, and these I thought might be
distinguished as town Arabs.Then the mountains of Tripoli are covered
with Arab villages, and some few considerable towns are inhabited by
people who are _bona-fide_ Arabs.Finally, the capitals of North Africa
are filled with every class of people found in the country.The question is then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the
case of nationalities?or can we, with any degree of precision, define
the limits which distinguish the various races in North Africa?With
regard to the Blacks or <DW64> tribes, there can be no great difficulty.The Jews are also easily distinguished from the rest of the people as
well by their national features as by their dress and habits or customs
of living.But, when we come to the Berbers, Arabs, Moors and Turks, we
can only distinguish them in their usual and ordinary occupations and
manners of life.Whenever they are intermixed, or whenever they change
their position, that is to say, whenever the Arab or Berber comes to
dwell in a town, or a Moor or a Turk goes to reside in the country,
adopting the Arab or Berber dress and mode of living, it is no longer
possible to distinguish the one from the other, or mark the limitation
of races.And since it is seen that the aborigines of Northern Africa consisted,
with the exception of the <DW64> tribes, of the Asiatics of the Caucasian
race or variety, many of whom, like the Phoenicians, have peopled
various cities and provinces of Europe, it is therefore not astonishing
we should find all the large towns and cities of North Africa, where the
human being becomes _policed_, refined and civilized sooner than in
remote and thinly-inhabited districts, teeming with a population, which
at once challenges an European type, and a corresponding origin with the
great European family of nations.North Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion.The
people, indeed, have but one religion.Even the extraneous Judaism is
the same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many
of the religious customs, festivals and traditions.And this has a
surprising effect in assimilating the opposite character and sharpest
peculiarities of various races of otherwise distinct and independant
origin.The population of Morocco presents five distant races and classes of
people; Berbers, Arabs, Moors, Jews and <DW64>s.Turks are not found in
Morocco, and do not come so far west; but sons of Turks by Moorish women
in Kouroglies are included among the Moors, that have emigrated from
Algeria.Maroquine Berbers, include the varieties of the Amayeegh [14]
and the Shelouh, who mostly are located in the mountains, while the
Arabs are settled on the plains.The Moors are the inhabitants of towns and cities, consisting of a
mixture of nearly all races, a great proportion of them being of the
descendants of the Moors expelled from Spain.All these races have been,
and will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work.The
proximate amount of this population is six millions.The greater number
of the towns and cities are situate on the coast, excepting the three or
four capitals, or imperial cities.The other towns of the interior
should be considered rather as forts to awe neighbouring tribes, or as
market villages (_souks_), where the people collect together for the
disposal and exchange of their produce.Numerous tribes, located in the
Atlas, escape the notice of the imposts of imperial authority.Their
varieties and amount of population are equally unknown.In the immense
group of Gibel Thelge (snowy mountains), some of the tribes are said to
have their faces shaved, like Christians, and to wear boots.We can
understand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and
perpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like
Christians, this is rather vague.But it is not impossible the Atlas
contains the descendants of some European refugees.The nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of
Spain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from
other parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic,
along which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of
twelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied
surface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the
absence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal
disease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the
most healthy in all Africa.In the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of
Spain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat,
but this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production
of valuable staple articles of commerce.Nevertheless, Morocco has its
extremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.The most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe, is
the vast Atlas chain of mountains [15], which traverses Morocco from
north-east to south-west, whose present ascertained culminating point,
Miltsin, is upwards of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, or equal
to the highest peaks of the Pyrenees.The Maroquine portion of the Atlas
contains its highest peaks, which stretch from the east of Tripoli to
the Atlantic Ocean, at Santa Cruz; and we find no mountains of equal
height, except in the tenth degree of North latitude, or 18,000 miles
south, or 30,000 south, south-east.The Rif coast has a mountainous
chain of some considerable height, but the Atlantic coast offers chiefly
ridges of hills.The coasts of Morocco are not much indented, and
consequently have few ports, and these offer poor protection from the
ocean.The general surface of Morocco presents a large ridge or lock, with two
immense declivities, one sloping N.W.to the ocean, with various rivers
and streams descending from this enormous back-bone of the Atlas, and
the other fulling towards the Sahara, S.E., feeding the streams and
affluents of Wad Draha, and other rivers, which are lost in the sands of
the Desert.This shape of the country prevents the formation of those
vast _Sebhahas_, or salt lakes, so frequent in Algeria and the south of
Tunis.We are acquainted only with two lakes of fresh or sweet
water--that of Debaia, traversed by Wad Draha,--and that of
Gibel-Akhder, which Leo compares to Lake Bolsena.The height of the
mountains, and the uniformity of their <DW72>s, produce large and
numerous rivers; indeed, the most considerable of all North Africa.These rivers of the North are shortest, but have the largest volume of
water; those of the South are larger, but are nearly dry the greater
part of the year.Some abound
with fish, particularly the Shebbel, or Barbary salmon.It is neither so
rich nor so large as our salmon, and is whitefleshed; it tastes
something like herring, but is of a finer and more delicate flavour.They are abundant in the market of Mogudor.The Shebbel, converted by
the Spaniards Sabalo, is found in the Guadalquivir.The products of the soil are nearly the same as in other parts of
Barbary.On the plains, or in the open country, the great cultivation is
wheat and barley; in suburban districts, vegetables and fruits are
propagated.In a commercial point of view, the North exports cattle,
grain, bark, leeches, and skins; and the South exports gums, almonds,
ostrich-feathers, wax, wool, and skins, as principle staple produce.When the rains cease or fail, the cultivation is kept up by irrigation,
and an excellent variety of fruits and esculent vegetables are produced;
indeed, nearly all the vegetables and fruit-trees of Southern Europe are
here abundantly and successfully cultivated, besides those peculiar to
an African clime and soil.In the south, grows a tree peculiar to this
country, the Eloeondenron Argan, so called from its Arabic name Argan.This tree produces fruit resembling the olive, whose egg-shaped, brown,
smooth and very hard stone, encloses a flat almond, of a white colour,
and of a very disagreeable taste, which, when crushed, produces a rancid
oil, used commonly as a substitute for olive-oil.The tree itself is
bushy and large, and sometimes grows of the size to a wide-spreading
oak.Not far from Mogador are several Argan forests.The level country
of the north is covered with forests of dwarfish oak; some bear sweet,
and others bitter acorns, and also the cork-tree, whose bark is a
considerable object of commerce.In the Atlas, has been found the
magnificent cedar of Lebanon.This tree has also been met with in
Algeria, but only on the mountains, some forty thousand feet above the
level of the sea.In the South there is, of course, growing in all its Saharan vigour, the
noble date-palm, and by its side, squats the palmetto, or dwarf-palm (in
Arabic _dauma_).Of trees and plants, the usual tinzah, and snouber or
pine of Aleppo, are used for preparing the fine leathers of Morocco.Many plants are also deleteriously employed for exciting intoxication,
or inflaming the passions.Morocco has its mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, sulphur,
mineral, salt, and antimony; but nearly all are neglected, or unworked.Government will not encourage the industry of the people, for fear of
exciting the cupidity of foreigners.A Frenchman, a short time ago,
reported a silver mine in the south, and Government immediately bribed
him to make another statement that there was no such mine.At Elala and
Stouka, in the province of Sous, are several rich silver mines.Gold is
found in the Atlas and the Lower Sous.But this country is especially
rich in copper mines.A great number of ancient and modern authors speak
of these mines, which are situate in the mountainous country comprised
between Aghadir, Morocco, Talda, Tamkrout, and Akka.The mines most
worked, are those of Tedsi and Afran.At the foot of the Atlas, near
Taroudant, is a great quantity of sulphur.In the neighbourhood of
Morocco, saltpetre is found.In the province of Abda is an extensive
salt lake, and salt has been exported from this country to Timbuctoo.Of
precious stones, some fine specimens of amethyst have been discovered.There are scarcely any animals peculiar to Morocco, or which are not
found in other parts of North Africa.Davidson mentions some curious
facts relative to the desert horse; "_sherb-errech_, wind-bibber, or
drinker of the wind," a variety of this animal, which is not to be met
with in the Saharan regions of Tunis, or Tripoli.This horse is fed only on camel's milk, and is principally used for
hunting ostriches, which are run down by it, and then captured.[16] The
_sherb-errech_ will continue running three or four days together without
any food.It is a slight and spare-formed animal, mostly in wretched
condition, with ugly thick legs, and devoid of beauty as a horse.Division of Morocco into kingdoms or States, and zones or regions.--

such divisions scarcely exist in the administration of the native
princes.The ancient division mentioned by Leo was that of two large
provinces of Morocco and Fez, separated by the river Bouragrag, which
empties itself into the sea between Rabat and Salee; and, indeed, for
several centuries, these districts were separated and governed by
independent princes.Tafilett always, and Sous occasionally, were united
to Morocco, while Fez itself formed a powerful kingdom, extending itself
eastward as far as the gates of Tlemsen.The modern division adopted by several authors, is--

Northern, or the kingdom of Fez.Eastern, or the Province of Tafilett.Some add to this latter, the Province of Draha.Then, a great number of districts are enumerated as comprehended in
these large and general divisions; but the true division of all
Mussulman States is into tribes.There is besides another, which more
approaches to European government, viz, into kaidats, or jurisdictions.The name of a district is usually that of its chief tribe, and mountains
are denominated after the tribes that inhabit them.There is, of course,
a natural division, sometimes called a dividing into zones or specific
regions, which has already been alluded to in enumerating the natural
resources of Morocco, and which besides corresponds with the present
political divisions.I. The North of the Atlas: coming first, the Rif, or mountainous region,
which borders the Mediterranean from the river Moulwia to Tangier,
comprising the districts of Hashbat west, and Gharet and Aklaia east.Then the intermediate zone of plains and hills, which extends from the
middle course of the Moulwia to Tangier on one coast, and to Mogador on
the other.The Central Region, or the great chain of the Atlas.The Deren [17]
of the natives, from the frontiers of Algeria east to Cape Gheer, on the
south-west.This includes the various districts of the Gharb, Temsna,
Beni Hasan, Shawia, Fez, Todla, Dukala, Shragno, Abda, Haha, Shedma,
Khamna, Morocco, &c.

III.South of the Atlas: or quasi-Saharan region, comprising the various
provinces and districts of Sous, Sidi Hisham, Wadnoun, Guezoula, Draha
(Draa), Tafilett, and a large portion of the Sahara, south-east of the
Atlas.As to statistics of population I am inclined fully to admit the
statement of Signor Balbi that, the term of African statistics ought to
be rejected as absurd.Count Hemo de Graeberg, who was a long time Consul
at Tangier, and wrote a statistical and geographical account of the
empire of Morocco, states the number of the inhabitants of the town of
Mazagran to be two thousand.Elton who resided there several months,
assured me it does not contain more than one hundred.Another gentleman
who dwelt there says, three hundred.This case is a fair sample of the
style in which the statistics of population in Morocco are and have been
calculated.Before the occupation of Algeria by the French, all the cities were
vulgarly calculated at double, or treble their amount of population.This has also been the case even in India, where we could obtain, with
care, tolerably correct statistics.The prejudices of oriental and
Africo-eastern people are wholly set against statistics, or numbering
the population.No mother knows the age of her own child.It is
ill-omened, if not an affront, to ask a man how many children he has;
and to demand the amount of the population of a city, is either
constructed as an infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent
Creator, who knows how many people he creates, and how to take care of
them, or it is the question of a spy, who is seeking to ascertain the
strength or weakness of the country.Europeans can, therefore, rarely
obtain any correct statistical information in Morocco: all is proximate
and conjectural.[18] I am anxious, nevertheless, to give some
particulars respecting the population, in order that we may really have
a proximate idea of the strength and resources of this important
country.In describing the towns and cities of the various provinces, I
shall divide them into,

1.Other towns and remarkable places in the interior [19].The towns and ports, on the Mediterranean, are of considerable interest,
but our information is very scanty, except as far as relates to the
_praesidios_ of Spain, or the well-known and much frequented towns of
Tetuan and Tangier.Near the mouth of the Malwia (or fifteen miles distant), is the little
town of Kalat-el-wad, with a castle in which the Governor resides.Whether the river is navigable up to this place, I have not been able to
discover.The water-communication of the interior of North Africa is not
worth the name.Zaffarinds or Jafarines, are three isles lying off the
west of the river Mulweeah, at a short distance, or near its mouth.These belong to Spain, and have recently been additionally fortified,
but why, or for what reason, is not so obvious.Opposite to them, there
is said to be a small town, situate on the mainland.The Spaniards, in
the utter feebleness and decadence of their power, have lately dubbed
some one or other "Captain-general of the Spanish possessions, &c. in
North Africa."Melilla or Melilah is a very ancient city, founded by the Carthaginians,
built near a cape called by the Romans, _Rusadir_ (now Tres-Forcas) the
name afterwards given to the city, and which it still retains in the
form of Ras-ed-Dir, (Head of the mountain).This town is the capital of
the province of Garet, and is said to contain 3,000 souls.It is situate
amidst a vast tract of fine country, abounding in minerals, and most
delicious honey, from which it is pretended the place receives its name.On an isle near, and joined to the mainland by a draw-bridge, is the
Spanish _praesidio_, or convict-settlement called also Melilla,
containing a population of 2,244 according to the Spanish, but Rabbi and
Graeberg do not give it more than a thousand.At a short distance,
towards the east, is an exceedingly spacious bay, of twenty-two miles in
circumference, where, they say, a thousand ships of war could be
anchored in perfect safety, and where the ancient galleys of Venice
carried on a lucrative trade with Fez.Within the bay, three miles
inland, are the ruins of the ancient city of Eazaza, once a celebrated
place.Alhucemos, is another small island and _praesidio_ of the Spaniards,
containing five or six hundred inhabitants; it commands the bay of the
same name, and is situate at the mouth of the river Wad Nechor, where
there is also the Islet of Ed-Housh.Near the bay, is the ancient
capital, Mezemma, now in ruins; it had, however, some commercial
importance in the times of Louis XIV., and carried on trade with France.Penon de Velez is the third _praesidio_-island, a convict settlement of
the Spaniards on this coast, and a very strong position, situate
opposite the mouths of the river Gomera, which disembogues in the
Mediterranean.So
far as natural resources are concerned, Penon de Velez is a mere rock,
and a part of the year is obliged to be supplied with fresh water from
the mainland.Immediately opposite to the continent is the city of
Gomera (or Badis), the ancient Parientina, or perhaps the Acra of
Ptolemy, afterwards called Belis, and by the Spaniards, Velez de la
Gomera.The name Gomera, according to J.A.Conde, is derived from the
celebrated Arab tribe of the Gomeres, who flourished in Africa and Spain
until the last Moorish kings of Granada.Count Graberg pretends Gomera
now contains three thousand inhabitants!whilst other writers, and of
later date, represent this ancient city, which has flourished and played
an important part through many ages, as entirely abandoned, and the
abode of serpents and hyaenas.Gellis is a small port, six miles east of
Velez de Gomera.Tegaza is a small town and port, at two miles or less from the sea near
Pescadores Point, inhabited mostly by fishermen, and containing a
thousand souls.The provinces of Rif and Garet, containing these maritime towns are rich
and highly cultivated, but inhabited by a warlike and semi-barbarous
race of Berbers, over whom the Emperor exercises an extremely precarious
authority.Among these tribes, Abd-el-Kader sought refuge and support
when he was obliged to retire from Algeria, and, where he defied all the
power of the Imperial government for several months.Had the Emir
chosen, he could have remained in Rif till this time; but he determined
to try his strength with the Sultan in a pitch battle, which should
decide his fate.The savage Rifians assemble for barter and trade on market-days, which
are occasions of fierce and incessant quarrels among themselves, when it
is not unusual for two or three persons to be left dead on the spot.Should any unfortunate vessel strike on these coasts, the crew find
themselves in the hands of inhuman wreckers.No European traveller has
ever visited these provinces, and we may state positively that
journeying here is more dangerous than in the farthest wastes of the
Sahara.Spanish renegades, however, are found among them, who have
escaped from the _praesidios_, or penal settlements.The Rif country is
full of mines, and is bounded south by one of the lesser chains of the
Atlas running parallel with the coast.Forests of cork clothe the
mountain-<DW72>s; the Berbers graze their herds and flocks in the deep
green valleys, and export quantities of skins.Tetuan, the Yagath of the Romans, situate at the opening of the Straits
of Gibraltar, four or five miles from the sea, upon the declivity of a
hill and within two small ranges of mountains, is a fine, large, rich
and mercantile city of the province of Hasbat.It has a resident
governor of considerable power and consequence, the name of the present
functionary being Hash-Hash, who has long held the appointment, and
enjoys great influence near the Sultan.Half a mile east of the city
passes from the south Wad Marteen, (the Cus of Marmol) which disembogues
into the sea; on its banks is the little port of Marteen or Marteel, not
quite two miles distant from the coast, and about three from the city,
where a good deal of commerce is carried on, small vessels, laden with
the produce of Barbary, sailing thence to Spain, Gibraltar, and even
France and Italy.The population of Tetouan is from nine to twelve
thousand souls, including, besides Moors and Arabs, four thousand Jews,
two thousand <DW64>s, and eight thousand Berbers.The streets are
generally formed into arcades, or covered bazaars.The Jews have a separate quarter; their women are celebrated for their
beauty.The suburbs are adorned with fine gardens, and olive and vine
plantations.Orange groves, or rather orange forests, extend for miles
around, yielding their golden treasures.A great export of oranges could
be established here, which might be conveyed overland to India.Altogether, Tetuan is one of the most respectable coast-cities of
Morocco, though it has no port immediately adjoining it.Its
fortifications are only strong enough to resist the attack of hostile
Berbers.The town is about two-thirds of a day's journey from Tangier,
south-east.A fair day's journey would be, in Morocco, upwards of thirty
English miles, but a good deal depends upon the season of the year when
you travel.Ceuta is considered to be Esilissa of Ptolemy, and was once the capital
of Mauritania Tingitana.The Arabs call it Sebat and Sebta, _i.e._,
"seven," after the Romans, who called it _Septem fratres_, and the
Greeks the same, apparently on account of the seven mountains, which are
in the neighbourhood.Ceuta, or Sebta, is evidently the modern form of
this classic name.It is a very ancient city and celebrated fortress,
situate fourteen miles south of Gibraltar, nearly opposite to it, as a
species of rival stronghold, and placed upon a peninsula, which detaches
itself from the continent on the east, and turns then to the north.The
city extends over the tongue of land nearest the continent; the citadel
occupies Monte-del-Acho, called formerly Jibel-el-Mina, a name still
preserved in Almina, a suburb to the south-east.In the beginning of the eighth century, Ceuta, which was inhabited by
the Goths, passed into the hands of the Arabs, who made it a point of
departure for the expeditions into Spain.It was conquered by the
powerful Arab family of the Ben-Hamed, one of whom, called Mohammed
Edris, invaded Spain, and, after several conquests, was proclaimed King
of Cordova, in A.D.1,000,

On 21st of August, 1415, the Portuguese conquered it, and it was the
first place which they occupied in Africa.In 1578, at the death of Don
Sebastian, Ceuta passed with Portugal and the rest of the colonies into
the power of Spain; and when, in 1640, the Portuguese recovered their
independence, the Spaniards were left masters of Ceuta, which continues
still in their hands, but is of no utility to them except as a
_praesidio_, which makes the fourth penal settlement possessed by them
on this coast.Ceuta contains a garrison of two or three thousand men.The free
population amounts to some five or six thousand.It has a small and
insecure port.Here is the famed Gibel Zaterit, "Monkey's promontory,"
or "Ape's Hill," which has occasioned the ingenious fable, that,
inasmuch as there are no monkeys in any part of Europe except Gibraltar,
directly opposite to this rock, where also monkeys are found, there must
necessarily be a subterranean passage beneath the sea, by which they
pass and re-pass to opposite sides of the Straits, and maintain a
friendly and uninterrupted intercourse between the brethren of Africa
and Europe.Anciently, the mountains hereabouts formed the African
pillars of Hercules opposite to Gibraltar, which may be considered the
European pillar of that respectable hero of antiquity.Passing Tangier after a day's journey, we come to Arzila or Asila, in
the province of Hasbat, which is an ancient Berber city, and which, when
conquered by the Romans, was named first Zilia and afterwards Zulia,
_Constantia Zilis_.It is placed on the naked shores of the Atlantic,
and has a little port.Whilst possessed by the Portuguese, it was a
place of considerable strength, but its fortifications being, as usual,
neglected by the Moors, are now rapidly decaying.[20] The population is
about one thousand.The next
town on the Atlantic, after another day's journey southwards, is El
Araish, _i.e._, the trellices of vines; vulgarly called Laratsh.This
city replaces the ancient Liscas or Lixus and Lixa, whose ruins are
near.The Arabs call it El-Araish Beai-Arous, _i.e._, the vineyards of
the Beni-Arous, a powerful tribe, who populate the greater part of the
district of Azgar, of which it is the capital and the residence of the
Governor.It was, probably, built by this tribe about 1,200 or 1,300,
AD.El-Araish contains a population of 2,700 Moors, and 1,300 Jews, or
4,000 souls; but others give only 2,000 for the whole amount, of which
250 are Jews.The town is situate upon
a small promontory stretching into the sea, and along the mouth of the
river Cos, or Luccos (Loukkos), which forms a secure port, but of so
difficult access, that vessels of two hundred tons can scarcely enter
it.In winter, the roadstead is very bad; [21] the houses are
substantially built; and the fortifications are good, because made by
the Spaniards, who captured this place in 1610, but it was re-taken by
Muley Ishmael in 1689.In the
environs, cotton is cultivated, and charcoal is made from the Araish
forest of cork-trees.El-Araish exports cork, wool, skins, bark, beans,
and grain, and receives in exchange iron, cloth, cottons, muslins, sugar
and tea.The lions and panthers of the mountains of Beni Arasis
sometimes descend to the plains to drink, or carry off a supper of a
sheep or bullock.Azgar, the name of this district, connects it with one
of the powerful tribes of the Touaricks; and, probably, a section of
this tribe of Berbers were resident here at a very early period (at the
same time the Berber term _ayghar_ corresponds to the Arabic _bahira_,
and signifies "plain.")The ancient Lixus deserves farther mention on account of the interest
attached to its coins, a few of which remain, although but very recently
deciphered by archeologists.There are five classes of them, and all
Phoenician, although the city now under Roman rule, represents the
vineyard riches of this part of ancient Mauritania by two bunches of
grapes, so that, after nearly three thousand years, the place has
retained its peculiarity of producing abundant vines, El-Araish, being
"the vine trellices;" others have stamped on them "two ears of corn" and
"two fishes," representing the fields of corn waving on the plains of
Morocco, and the fish (shebbel especially) which fills its northern
rivers.Strabo says:--"Mauritania generally, excepting a small part desert, is
rich and fertile, well watered with rivers and washed with lakes;
abounding in all things, and producing trees of great dimensions."Another writer adds "this country produces a species of the vine whose
trunk the extended arms of two men cannot embrace, and which yields
grapes of a cubit's length.""At this city," says Pliny, "was the palace
of Antaeus, and his combat with Hercules and the gardens of Hesperides."Mehedia or Mamora, and sometimes, Nuova Mamora, is situate upon the
north-western <DW72> of a great hill, some four feet above the sea, upon
the left bank of the mouth of the Sebon, and at the edge of the
celebrated plain and forest of Mamora, belonging to the province of
Beni-Hassan.According to Marmol, Mamora was built by Jakob-el-Mansour
to defend the embouchure of the river.It was captured by the Spaniards
in 1614, and retaken by the Moors in 1681.The Corsairs formerly took
refuge here.It is now a weak and miserable place, commanded by an old
crumbling-down castle.There are five or six hundred fishermen,
occupying one hundred and fifty cabins, who make a good trade of the
Shebbel salmon; it has a very small garrison.The forest of Mamora,
contains about sixty acres of fine trees, among which are some splendid
oaks, all suitable for naval construction.Salee or Sala, a name which this place bore antecedently to the Roman
occupation, is a very ancient city, situate upon the right bank of the
river Bouragrag, and near its mouth.This place was captured in 1263, by
Alphonso the Wise, King of Castille, who was a short time after
dispossessed of his conquest by the King of Fez; and the Moorish Sultans
have kept it to the present time, though the city itself has often
attempted to throw off the imperial yoke.The modern Salee is a large
commercial and well-fortified city of the province of Beni-Hassan.Its
port is sufficiently large, but, on account of the little depth of
water, vessels of large burden cannot enter it.The houses and public
places are tolerably well-built.The town is fortified by a battery of
twenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the sea, and a redoubt at the
entrance of the river.What navy the Maroquines have, is still laid up
here, but the dock-yard is now nearly deserted, and the few remaining
ships are unserviceable.The population, all of whom are Mahometans, are
now, as in Corsair times, the bitterest and most determined enemies of
Christians, and will not permit a Christian or Jew to reside among them.The amount of this population, and that of Rabat, is thus given,

  _Salee Rabat_
  Graeberg         23,000    27,000
  Washington       9,000    21,000
  Arlett          14,000    24,000

but it is probably greatly exaggerated.A resident of this country reduces the population of Salee as low as two
or three thousand.For many years, the port of Salee was the rendezvous
of the notorious pirates of Morocco, who, together with the city of
Rabat, formed a species of military republic almost independent of the
Sultan; these Salee rovers were at once the most ferocious and
courageous in the world.Time was, when these audacious freebooters lay
under Lundy Island in the British Channel, waiting to intercept British
traders!"Salee," says Lempriere, "was a place of good commerce, till,
addicting itself entirely to piracy, and revolting from the allegiance
to its Sovereign, Muley Zidan, that prince in the year 1648, dispatched
an embassy to King Charles 1, of England, requesting him to send a
squadron of men-of-war to lie before the town, while he attacked by
land."This request being acceded to, the city was soon reduced, the
fortifications demolished, and the leaders of the rebellion put to
death.The year following, the Emperor sent another ambassador to
England, with a present of Barbary horses and three hundred Christian
slaves.Rabat, or Er-Rabat, and on some of the foreign maps Nuova Sale, is a
modern city of considerable extent, densely populated, strong and
well-built, belonging to the province of Temsna.It is situated on the
declivity of a hill, opposite to Salee, on the other side of the river,
or left side of the Bouragrag, which is as broad as the Thames at
London Bridge, and might be considered as a great suburb, or another
quarter of the same city.It was built by the famous Yakob-el-Mansour,
nephew of Abd-el-Moumen, and named by him Rabat-el-Fatah, _i.e._, "camp
of victory," by which name it is now often mentioned.The walls of Rabat enclose a large space of ground, and the town is
defended on the seaside by three forts, erected some years ago by an
English renegade, and furnished with ordnance from Gibraltar.Among the
population are three or four thousand Jews, some of them of great wealth
and consequence.The merchants are active and intelligent, carrying on
commerce with Fez, and other places of the interior, as also with the
foreign ports of Genoa, Gibraltar, and Marseilles.In the middle ages,
the Genoese had a great trade with Rabat, but this trade is now removed
to Mogador, Many beautiful gardens and plantations adorn the suburbs,
deserving even the name of "an earthly paradise."The Moors of Rabat are mostly from Spain, expelled thence by the
Spaniards.The famous Sultan, Almanzor, intended that Rabat should be
his capital.His untenanted mausoleum is placed here, in a separate and
sacred quarter.This prince, surnamed "the victorious," (Elmansor,) was
he who expelled the Moravedi from Spain.He is the Nero of Western
Africa, as Keatinge says, their "King Arthur."Tradition has it that
Elmansor went in disguise to Mecca, and returned no more.Mankind love
this indefinite and obscure end of their heroes.Moses went up to the
mountain to die there in eternal mystery.At a short distance from Rabat
is Shella, or its ruins, a small suburb situated on the summit of a
hill, which contains the tombs of the royal family of the Beni-Merini,
and the founder of Rabat, and is a place of inviolate sanctity, no
infidel being permitted to enter therein.Monsieur Chenier supposes
Shella to have been the site of the metropolis of the Carthaginian
colonies.Of these two cities, on the banks of the Wad-Bouragrag, Salee was,
according to D'Anville, always a place of note as at the present time,
and the farthest Roman city on the coast of the Atlantic, being the
frontier town of the ancient Mauritania Tingitana.Some pretend that all
the civilization which has extended itself beyond this point is either
Moorish, or derived from European colonists.The river Wad-Bouragrag is
somewhat a natural line of demarcation, and the products and animals of
the one side differ materially from those of the other, owing to the
number and less rapid descent of the streams on the side of the north,
and so producing more humidity, whilst the south side, on the contrary,
is of a higher and drier soil.Fidallah, or Seid Allah, _i.e_., "grace," or "gift of God," is a
maritime village of the province of Temsa, founded by the Sultan
Mohammed in 1773.It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.Fidallah is situated on a vast plain, near the river Wad Millah, where
there is a small port, or roadstead, to which the corsairs were wont to
resort when they could not reach Salee, long before the village was
built, called Mersa Fidallah.The place contains a thousand souls,
mostly in a wretched condition.Sidi Mohammed, before he built Mogador,
had the idea of building a city here; the situation is indeed
delightful, surrounded with fertility.Dar-el-Beida (or Casa-Blanco, "white house,") is a small town, formerly
in possession of the Portuguese, who built it upon the ruins of Anfa or
Anafa, [22] which they destroyed in 1468.They, however, scarcely
finished it when they abandoned it in 1515.Dar-el-Beida is situate on
the borders of the fertile plains of the province of Shawiya, and has a
small port, formed by a river and a spacious bay on the Atlantic.The
Romans are said to have built the ancient Anafa, in whose time it was a
considerable place, but now it scarcely contains above a thousand
inhabitants, and some reduce them to two hundred.Sidi Mohammed
attempted this place, and the present Sultan endeavoured to follow up
these efforts.A little commerce with Europe is carried on here.The bay
will admit of vessels of large burden anchoring in safety, except when
the wind blows strong from the north-west.Casa Blanco is two days
journey from Rabat, and two from Azamor, or Azemmour, which is an
ancient and fine city of the province of Dukaila, built by the Amazigh
Berbers, in whose language it signifies "olives."It is situate upon a
hill, about one hundred feet above the sea, and distant half a mile from
the shore, not far from the mouth of the Wad-Omm-er-Rbia (or Omm-Erbegh)
on its southern bank, and is everywhere surrounded by a most fertile
soil.Azamor contains now about eight or nine hundred inhabitants, but
formerly was much more populated.The Shebbel salmon is the principal
commerce, and a source of immense profit to the town.The river is very
deep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and
dangerous.It is frequently of a red colour, and charged with slime like
the Nile at the period of its inundations.The tide is felt five or six
leagues up the river, according to Chenier.Formerly, vessels of every
size entered the river, but now its mouth has a most difficult bar of
sand, preventing large vessels going up, like nearly all the Maroquine
ports situate on the mouths, or within the rivers.Azamor was taken by the Portuguese under the command of the Duke of
Braganza in 1513 who strengthened it by fortifications, the walls of
which are still standing; but it was abandoned a century afterwards, the
Indies having opened a more lucrative field of enterprise than these
barren though honourable conquests on the Maroquine coast.This place is
half a day's journey, or about fourteen miles from Mazagran, _i.the
above Amayeeghs, an extremely ancient and strong castle, erected on a
peninsula at the bottom of a spacious and excellent bay.It was rebuilt
by the Portuguese in 1506, who gave it the name of Castillo Real.The
site has been a centre of population from the remotest period, chiefly
Berbers, whose name it still bears.The Arabs, however, call it
El-Bureeja, i.e., "the citadel."The Portuguese abandoned it in 1769;
Mazagran was the last stronghold which they possessed in Morocco.The
town is well constructed, and has a wall twelve feet thick, strengthened
with bastions.There is a small port, or dock, on the north side of the
town, capable of admitting small vessels, and the roadstead is good,
where large vessels can anchor about two miles off the shore.Its
traffic is principally with Rabat, but there is also some export trade
to foreign parts.[23] After
proceeding two days south-west, you arrive at Saffee, or properly
Asafee, called by the natives Asfee, and anciently Soffia or Saffia, is
a city of great antiquity, belonging to the province of Abda, and was
built by the Carthaginians near Cape Pantin.Its site lies between two
hills, in a valley which is exposed to frequent inundations.The
roadstead of Saffee is good and safe during summer, and its shipping
once enabled it to be the centre of European commerce on the Atlantic
coast.The population amounts to about one thousand, including a number
of miserable Jews.The walls of Saffee are massy and high.The
Portuguese captured this city in 1508, voluntarily abandoning it in
1641.The country around is not much cultivated, and presents melancholy
deserts; but there is still a quantity of corn grown.About forty miles
distant, S.E., is a large salt lake.Saffee is one and a half day's
journey from Mogador.Equidistant between Mazagran and Saffee is the small town of El-Waladia,
situate on an extensive plain.Persons report that near this spot is a
spacious harbour, or lagune, sufficiently capacious to contain four or
five hundred sail of the line; but, unfortunately, the entrance is
obstructed by some rocks, which, however, it is added, might easily be
blown up.The lagune is also exposed to winds direct for the ocean.The
town, enclosed within a square wall, and containing very few
inhabitants, is supposed to have been built in the middle of the
seventeenth century by the Sultan Waleed.This brings us to Mogador, which, with Aghadir, have already been
described.CHAPTER V.

Description of the Imperial Cities or Capitals of the Empire.--
El-Kesar.--Mequinez.--Fez.--Morocco.--The province of Tafilett, the
birth-place of the present dynasty of the Shereefs.The royal or capitals of the interior now demand our attention, which
are El-Kesar, Mequinez, Fez, and Morocco.El-Kesar, or Al-Kesar, [24] styled also El-Kesue-Kesar, is so named and
distinguished because it owes its enlargement to the famous Sultan of
Fez, Almansor, who improved and beautified it about the year 1180, and
designed this city as a magazine and rendezvous of troops for the great
preparations he was making at the time for the conquest of Granada.El-Kesar is in the province of the Gharb, and situate on the southern
bank of the Luccos; here is a deep and rapid stream, flowing W.The town is nearly as large as Tetuan, but the streets are dirty and
narrow, and many of the houses in a ruinous condition, This fortified
place was once adorned by some fifteen mosques, but only two or three
are now fit for service.The population does not exceed four or five
thousand souls, and some think this number over-estimated.The surrounding country is flat meadowland, but flooded after the rains,
and producing fatal fevers, though dry and hot enough in summer.The
suburban fields are covered with gardens and orchards.It was at
El-Kesar, where, in A.D.1578, the great battle of The Three Kings came
off, because, besides the Portuguese King, Don Sebastian, two Moorish
princes perished on this fatal day.But one of them, Muley Moluc, died
very ill in a litter, and was not killed in the fight; his death,
however, was kept a secret till the close of the battle, in order that
the Moors might not be discouraged.With their prince, Don Sebastian,
perished the flower of the Portuguese nobility and chivalry of that
time.War, indeed, was found "a dangerous game" on that woeful day: both
for princes and nobles, and many a poor soul was swept away

  "Floating in a purple tide."But the "trade of war" has been carried on ever since, and these
lessons, written in blood, are as useless to mankind as those dashed off
by the harmless pen of the sentimental moralist.El-Kesar is placed in
Latitude, 35 deg.1 10" N.; Longitude, 5 deg.49' 30" W.

Mequinez, [25] in Arabic, Miknas (or Miknasa), is a royal residence, and
city of the province of Fez, situate upon a hill in the midst of a
well-watered and most pleasant town, blessed with a pure and serene air.The city of Miknas is both large and finely built, of considerable
interest and of great antiquity.It was founded by the tribe of Berbers
Meknasab, a fraction of the Zenatah, in the middle of the tenth century,
and called Miknasat, hence is derived its present name.The modern town
is surrounded with a triple wall thirteen feet high and three thick,
enclosing a spacious area.This wall is mounted with batteries to awe
the Berbers of the neighbouring mountains.The population amounts to
about twenty thousand souls, (some say forty or fifty thousand) in which
are included about nine thousand <DW64> troops, constituting the greater
portion of the Imperial guard.Two thousand of these black troops are in
charge of the royal treasures, estimated at some fifty millions of
dollars, and always increasing.These treasures consist of jewels, bars
of gold and silver, and money in the two precious metals, the greater
part being Spanish and Mexican dollars.The inhabitants are represented as being the most polished of the Moors,
kind and hospitable to strangers.The palace of the Emperor is extremely
simple and elegant, all the walls of which are _embroidered_ with the
beautiful stucco-work of Arabesque patterns, as pure and chaste as the
finest lace.The marble for the pillars was furnished from the ruins
adjacent, called Kesar Faraoun, "Castle of Pharoah" (a name given to
most of the old ruins of Morocco, of whose origin there is any doubt).During the times of piracy, there was here, as also at Morocco, a
Spanish hospitium for the ransom and recovery of Christian slaves.Even
before Mequinez was constituted a royal city, it was a place of
considerable trade and riches.Nothing of any peculiar value has been
discovered among the extensive and ancient ruins about a mile distant,
and which have furnished materials for the building of several royal
cities; they are, however, supposed to be Roman.Scarcely a day's
journey separates Mequinez from Fez.It is not usual for two royal
cities to be placed so near together, but which must render their
fortunes inseparable.According to some, the name Fas, which signifies in Arabia
a pickaxe, was given to it because one was found in digging its
foundations.Others derive it from Fetha, silver.It is no longer the
marvellous city described by Leo Africanus, yet its learning, wealth,
and industry place it in the first rank of the cities of Morocco.During
the eighth century, the Arabs, masters of Tunis, of all Algeria, and the
maritime cities of Morocco, seemed to think only of invading Europe and
consolidating their power in Spain; but at this epoch, a descendant of
Ali and Fatima, Edris Ben Abdalluh, quitted Arabia, passed into Morocco,
and established himself at Oualili, the capital, where he remained till
his death, and where he was buried.His character was generally known
and venerated for its sanctity, and drew upon him the affectionate
regard of the people, and all instinctively placed themselves near him
as a leader of the Faithful, likely to put an end to anarchy, and
establish order in the Mussulman world.His son, Edris-Ben-Edris, who
inherited his virtues and influence, offering a species of ancient
prototype to Abd-el Kader and his venerable father, Mahadin, was the
first _bona-fide_ Mussulman sovereign of the Maroquine empire, and
founded Fez.Fez is a most ancient centre of population, and had long been a famed
city, before Muley Edris, in the year A.D.807 (others in 793), gave it
its present form and character.From that period, however, Fez [26] dates its modern celebrity and rank
among the Mahometan capitals of the world, and especially as being the
second city of Islamism, and the "palace of the Mussulmen Princes of the
West."That the Spanish philologists should make Fut, of the Prophet
Nahum, to be the ancient capital of Fez, is not remarkable, considering
the numerous bands of emigrants, who, emerging from the coast, wandered
as far as the pillars of Hercules; and, besides, in a country like North
Africa, the theatre of so many revolutions, almost every noted city of
the present period has had its ancient form, from which it has been
successively changed.The modern capital is placed in a valley upon the gentle <DW72> of
several hills by which it is surrounded, and whose heights are crowned
with lovely gardens breathing odoriferous sweets.Close by is a little
river, or a branch of the Tebou, named Wad-el-Juhor, or "streamlet,"
which supplies the city with excellent water.The present buildings are divided into old and new Fez.The streets are
so narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely ride abreast; they
are, besides, very dark, and often arched over.Colonel Scott represents
some of the streets, however, as a mile in length.The houses are high,
but not handsome.The shops are numerous and much frequented, though not
very fine in appearance.Fez contains no less than seven hundred
mosques, fifty of which are superb, and ornamented with fine columns of
marble; there is, besides, a hundred or more of very small and ill-built
mosques, or rather, houses of prayer.The most famous of these temples
of worship is El-Karoubin (or El-Karouiin), supported by three hundred
pillars.In this is preserved the celebrated library of antiquity,
where, it is pretended, ancient Greek and Latin authors are to be found
in abundance with the lost books of Titus Livy.[27] But the mosque the more
frequented and venerated, is that dedicated to the founder of the city,
Muley Edris, whose ashes repose within its sacred enclosure.So
excessive is this "hero-worship" for this great sultan, that the people
constantly invoke his name in their prayers instead of that of the
Deity.The mausoleum of this sacro-santo prince is inviolable and
unapproachable.The university of Fez was formally much celebrated, but
little of its learning now remains.Its once high-minded orthodox mulahs
are now succeeded by a fanatic and ignorant race of marabouts.Nevertheless, the few _hommes de lettres_ found in Morocco are
congregated here, and the literature of the empire is concentrated in
this city.Seven large public schools are in full activity, besides
numbers of private seminaries of instruction.The low humour of the
talebs, and the fanaticism of the people, are unitedly preserved and
developed in this notorious doggerel couplet, universally diffused
throughout Morocco:--

  _Ensara fee Senara
  Elhoud fee Sefoud_

  "Christians on the hook
  Jews on the spit," or

  "Let Christians be hooked,
  And let Jews be cooked."The great division of the Arabic into eastern and western dialects makes
little real difference in a practical point of view.The Mogrebbin, or
western, is well understood by all travellers, and, of course, by all
scholars from the East.The palace of the Sultan is not large, but is handsome.There are
numerous baths, and an hospital for the mad or incurable.The population
was estimated, not long ago, at 88,000 souls, of which there were 60,000
Moors and Arabs (the Moors being chiefly immigrants from Spain), 10,000
Berbers, 8,000 Jews, and 10,000 <DW64>s.But this amount has been
reduced to 40,000, or even 30,000; and the probability is, the present
population of Fez does not by any means, exceed 50,000, if it reaches
that number.Nearly all the Jews reside in the new city, which, by its
position, dominates the old one.The inhabitants of Fez, in spite of
their learning and commerce, are distinguished for their fanaticism; and
an European, without an escort of troops, cannot walk in the streets
unless disguised.It was lately the head-quarters of the fanatics who
preached "the holy war," and involved the Emperor in hostilities with
the French.The immense trade of every kind carried on at Fez gives it almost the
air of an European city.In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is
exhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole
world.The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair.Fez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or
Timbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims.The two
great stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett
and Touat.The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days.The Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then
turns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to
Alexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months.All
depends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the
caravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest
caravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half,
or one hundred days.The value of the investments in this caravan has
been estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of
the Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life
that now is, as well as in that which is to come.Fez is surrounded with a vast wall, but which is in decay.It applies almost to every Moorish city and public building in
North Africa.And yet the faith of the false prophet is as strong as
ever, and with time and hoary age seems to strike its roots deeper into
the hearts of its simple, but enthusiastic and duped devotees!The city has seven gates, and two castles, at the east and west, form
its main defence.These castles are very ancient, and are formed and
supported by square walls about sixty feet in front, Ali Bey says,
subterraneous passages are reported to exist between these castles and
the city; and, whenever the people revolt against the Sultan, cannon are
planted on the castles with a few soldiers as their guard.The
fortifications, or Bastiles, of Paris, we see, therefore, were no new
invention of Louis Philippe to awe the populace.The maxims of a subtle
policy are instructive in despotism of every description.The constituted authorities of Fez are like those of every city of
Morocco.The Governor is the lieutenant of the sovereign, exercising the
executive power; the Kady, or supreme judge, is charged with the
administration of the law, and the Al-Motassen fixes the price of
provisions, and decides all the questions of trade and customs.There
are but few troops at Fez, for it is not a strong military possession;
on the contrary, it is commanded by accessible heights and is exposed to
a _coup-de-main_.Fez, indeed, could make no _bona-fide_ resistance to an European army.The manufactures are principally woollen haiks, silk handkerchiefs,
slippers and shoes of excellent leather, and red caps of felt, commonly
called the fez; the first fabrication of these red caps appears to have
been in this city.The Spanish Moorish immigrants introduced the mode of
dressing goat and sheep-skins, at first known by the name of Cordovan
from Cordova; but, since the Moorish forced immigration, they have
acquired the celebrated name of Morocco.The chief food of the people is
the national Moorish dish of _cuscasou_, a fine grained paste, cooked by
steam, with melted fat, oil, or other liquids poured upon the dish, and
sometimes garnished with pieces of fowl and other meat.A good deal of
animal food is consumed, but few vegetables.The climate is mild in the
winter, but suffocating with heat in the summer.This city is placed in
latittude 34 deg.6' 3" N. longitude 4 deg.Morocco, or strictly in Arabic, _Maraksh_, which signifies "adorned,"
is the capital of the South, and frequently denominated the capital of
the Empire, but it is only a _triste_ shadow of its former greatness.It
is sometimes honoured with the title of "the great city," or "country."Morocco occupies an immense area of ground, being seven miles in
circumference, the interior of which is covered with heaps of ruins or
more pleasantly converted into gardens.Morocco was built in 1072 or
1073 by the famous Yousel-Ben-Tashfin, King of Samtuna, and of the
dynasty of the Almoravedi, or Marabouts.Its site is that of an ancient
city, Martok, founded in the remotest periods of the primitive Africans,
or aboriginal Berbers, in whose language it signifies a place where
everything good and pleasant was to be found in abundance.Bocanum Hermerum of the Ancients was also near the site of this capital,
Morocco attained its greatest prosperity shortly after its foundation,
and since then it has only declined.In the twelfth century, under the
reign of Jakoub Almanzor, there were 10,000 houses and 700,000 souls,
(if indeed we can trust their statistics); but, at the present time,
there are only some forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, including 4,000
Shelouhs and 5,000 Jews.Ali Bey, in 1804, estimates its population at
only 30,000, and Captain Washington in 1830 at 80, or 100,000.This vast
city lies at the foot of the Atlas, or about fourteen miles distant,
spread over a wide and most lovely plain of the province of Rhamma,
watered by the river Tensift, six miles from the gates of the capital.The mosques are numerous and rich, the principal of which are
El-Kirtubeeah, of elegant architecture with an extremely lofty minaret;
El-Maazin, which is three hundred years old, and a magnificent building;
and Benious, built nearly seven hundred years ago of singular
construction, uniting modern and ancient architecture.The mosque of the
patron saint is Sidi Belabbess.Nine gates open in the city-walls; these
are strong and high, and flanked with towers, except on the south east
where the Sultan's palace stands.The streets are crooked, of uneven
width, unpaved, and dirty in winter, and full of dust in summer.The Kaessaria, or
commercial quarter, is extensive, exhibiting every species of
manufacture and natural product.The manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally,
silks, embroidery, and leather.The merchants of Mogador have magazines
here; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior,
passing through Wadnoun to the south.The Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls.There are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives
his merchants and the diplomatic agents.The air of the country, at the
foot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious.The city is well supplied
with water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which
flows from the gorges of the Atlas.But the inhabitants, although they
enjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous
for their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character,
still must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a
very low ebb.Its interior wears a deeply dejected, nay a profoundly
gloomy aspect."Horrendum incultumque specus."and the European merchants, when they come up here are glad to get away
as soon as possible.Outside the city, there is a suburb appropriated to lepers, a
Lazar-house of leprosy, which afflicting and loathsome disease descends
from father to son through unbroken generations; the afflicted cannot
enter the city, and no one dare approach their habitations.The Emperor
usually resides for a third portion of his time at Morocco the rest at
Fez and Mequinez.Whenever his Imperial Highness has anything
disagreeable with foreign European powers, he comes down from Fez to
Morocco, to get out of the way.Occasionally, he travels from town to
town of the interior, to awe by his presence the ever restless
disaflfection of the tribes, or excite their loyalty for the Shereefian
throne.35" 30', W.

Tafilett consists of a group of towns or villages, situate on the
south-eastern side of the Atlas, which may he added to the royal cities,
being inhabited in part by the Imperial family, and is the birth-place
of their sovereign power--emphatically called Beladesh-Sherfa, "country
of the Shereefs."The country was anciently called Sedjelmasa, and
retained this name up to 1530 A.D., when the principal city acquired the
apellation of Tafilett, said to be derived from an Arab immigrant,
called Filal, who improved the culture of dates, and whose name on this
account, under the Berber form of Tafilett, was given to a plantation of
dates cultivated by him, and then passed to the surrounding districts.At the present time, Tafilett consists of a group of fortified or
castle-built villages, environed by walls mounted with square towers,
which extend on both sides of the river Zig.There is also a castle, or
rather small town, upon the left side of the river, called by the
ordinary name of Kesar, which is in the hands of the Shereefs, and
inhabited entirely by the family of the Prophet.The principal and most
flourishing place was a long time called Tafilett, but is now according
to Callie, Ghourlan, and the residence of the Governor of the province
of Ressant, a town distinguished by a magnificent gateway surrounded
with various  Dutch tiles, symmetrically arranged in a diamond
pattern.This traveller calls the district of Tafilett, Afile or Afilel.It is probable that from the rains of the ancient Sedjelmasa, some of
the modern villages have been constructed.The towns and districts of
Tafilett once formed an independent kingdom.The present population has
been estimated at some ten thousand, but this is entirely conjectural.Callie mentions the four towns of Ghourlan, L'Eksebi, Sosso and Boheim
as containing eleven or twelve thousand souls.The soil of Tafilett is
level, composed of sand of an ashy grey, productive of corn, and all
sorts of European fruits and vegetables.The natives have fine sheep,
with remarkably white wool.The manufactures, which are in woollen and
silk, are called Tafiletes.Besides being a rendezvous of caravans, radiating through all parts of
the Sahara, Tafilett is a great mart of traffic in the natural products
of the surrounding countries.A fine bridge spans the Zig, built by a
Spaniard.When the Sultan of Morocco finds any portion of his family
inclined to be naughty, he sends them to Tafilett, as we are wont to
send troublesome people to "Jericho."This, at any rate, is better than
cutting off their heads, which, from time immemorial, has been the
invariable practice of African and Oriental despots.The Maroquine
princes may be thankful they have Tafilett as a place of exile.The
Emperors never visit Tafilett except as dethroned exiles.A journey to
such a place is always attended with danger; and were the Sultan to
escape, he would find, on his return, the whole country in revolt.Regarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations.The destinies
of Fez and Mequinez are inseparable.United, they contain one hundred
thousand inhabitants, the most polished and learned in the Empire.Fez
is the city of arts and learning, that is of what remains of the once
famous and profound Moorish doctors of Spain.Mequinez is the strong
place of the Empire, an emporium of arms and imperial Cretsures.The two cities are the capitals of two kingdoms,
never yet amalgamated.The present dynasty belongs not to Fez, but to
Morocco; though a dynasty of Shereefs, they are Shereefs of the south,
and African blood flows in their veins.The Sultan generally is obliged to give a preference to Fez for a
residence, because his presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance
of the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty, his son in the
meanwhile being left Governor during his absence.But all these royal
cities are on the decline, the "sere and yellow leaf" of a well nigh
defunct civilization.Morocco is a huge shell of its former greatness, a
monster of Moresque dilapidations.France may awaken the slumbering
energies of the population of these once flourishing and august cities,
but left to themselves they are powerless, sinking under their own
weight and uncouth encumbrances, and will rise no more till
reconstructed by European hands.Description of the towns and cities of the Interior, and those of the

interior, with some other remarkable places.First, these distinguished and well ascertained places in the kingdom of
Fez.Seisouan, or Sousan, is the capital of the Rif province, situate also on
the borders of the province of the Habat, and by the sources of a little
river which runs into the Mediterranean, near Cape Mazari.The town is
small, but full of artizans and merchants.The country around is
fertile, being well irrigated with streams.Sousan is the most
beautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range.Sofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon
the river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines
of fossil salt.Wazen, or Wazein, in the province of Azgar, and the region of the Gharb,
is a small city without Walls, celebrated for being the residence of
the High Priest, or Grand Marabout of the Empire.This title is
hereditary, and is now (or up to lately) possessed by the famous
Sidi-el-Haj-el-Araby-Ben-Ali, who, in his district, lives in a state of
nearly absolute independence, besides exercising great influence over
public affairs.This saint, or priest, has, however, a rival at Tedda.The two popes together pretend to decide the fate of the Empire.The
districts where these Grand Marabouts reside, are without governors,
and the inhabitants pay no tribute into the imperial coffers, they are
ruled by their two priests under a species of theocracy.The Emperor
never attempts or dares to contest their privileges.Occasionally they
appear abroad, exciting the people, and declaiming against the vices of
the times.His Moorish Majesty then feels himself ill at ease, until
they retire to their sanctuaries, and employs all his arts to effect
the object, protesting that he will be wholly guided by their councils
in the future administration of the Empire.With this humiliation of
the Shereefs, they are satisfied, and kennel themselves into their
sanctum-sanctorums.Zawiat-Muley-Driss, which means, retirement of our master, Lord Edris
(Enoch) and sometimes called Muley Edris, is a far famed city of the
province of Fez, and placed at the foot of the lofty mountains of
Terhoun, about twenty-eight miles from Fez, north-west, amidst a most
beautiful country, producing all the necessaries and luxuries of human
life.The site anciently called Tuilet, was perhaps also the Volubilis
of the ancients.Here is a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of Edris,
progenitor and founder of the dynasty of Edrisiti.The population, given by Graeberg, is nine thousand, but this is
evidently exaggerated.Not far off, towards the west, are some
magnificent ruins of an ancient city, called Kesar Faraoun, or "Castle
of Pharoah."Dubdu, called also Doubouton, is an ancient, large city, of the district
of Shaous, and once the residence of an independent prince, but now
fallen into decay on account of the sterility of its site, which is upon
the sides of a barren mountain.Dubdu is three days' journey southeast
of Fez, and one day from Taza, in the region of the Mulweeah.Taza is
the capital of the well-watered district of Haiaina, and one of the
finest cities in Morocco, in a most romantic situation, placed on a rock
which is shaped like an island, and in presence of the lofty mountains
of Zibel Medghara, to the south-west.Perhaps it is the Babba of the
ancients; a river runs round the town.The houses and streets are
spacious, and there is a large mosque.The air is pure, and provisions
are excellent.The population is estimated at ten or twelve thousand,
who are hospitable, and carry on a good deal of commerce with Tlemsen
and Fez.Taza is two days from Fez, and four from Oushda.Oushda is the well-known frontier town, on the north-east, which
acquired some celebrity during the late war.It is enclosed by the walls
of its gardens, and is protected by a large fortress.The place contains
a population of from six hundred to one thousand Moors and Arabs.There
is a mosque, as well as three chapels, dedicated to Santous.The houses,
built of clay, are low and of a wretched appearance; the streets are
winding, and covered with flints.The fortress, where the Kaed resides,
is guarded in ordinary times by a dozen soldiers; but, were this force
increased, it could not be defended, in consequence of its dilapidated
condition.A spring of excellent water, at a little distance from
Oushda, keeps up the whole year round freshness and verdure in the
gardens, by means of irrigation.Oushda is a species of oasis of the Desert of Angad, and the aridity of
the surrounding country makes these gardens appear delicious, melons,
olives, and figs being produced in abundance.The distance between Tlemsen and Oushda is sixteen leagues, or about
sixteen hours' march for troops; Oushda is also four or five days from
Oran, and six days from Fez.The Desert commences beyond the Mulweeah,
at more than forty leagues from Tlemsen.Like the Algerian Angad, which
extends to the south of Tlemsen, it is of frightful sterility,
particularly in summer.In this season, one may march for six or eight
hours without finding any water.It is impossible to carry on military
operations in such a country during summer.On this account, Marshal
Bugeaud soon excavated Oushda and returned to the Tlemsen territory.Aghla is a town, or rather large village, of the district of Fez, where
the late Muley Suleiman occasionally resided.It is situated along the
river Wad Vergha, in a spacious and well-cultivated district.A great
market of cattle, wool, and bees'-wax, is held in the neighbourhood.The
country abounds in lions; but, it is pretended, of such a cowardly race,
that a child can frighten them away.Hence the proverb addressed to a
pusillanimous individual, "You are as brave as the lions of Aghla, whose
tails the calves eat."The Arabs certainly do occasionally run after
lions with sticks, or throw stones at them, as we are accustomed to
throw stones at dogs.Nakhila, _i.e._, "little palm," is a little town of the province of
Temsna, placed in the river Gueer; very ancient, and formerly rich and
thickly populated.A great mart, or souk, is annually held at this
place.It is the site of the ancient Occath.Meshru Khaluf, _i.e._, "ford, or watering-place of the wild-boar," in
the district of the Beni-Miskeen, is a populated village, and situated
on the right bank of the Ovad Omm-Erbergh, lying on the route of many of
the chief cities.Here is the ford of Meshra Khaluf, forty-five feet
wide, from which the village derives its name.On the map will be seen many places called Souk.The interior tribes
resort thither to purchase and exchange commodities.The market-places
form groups of villages.It is not a part of my plan to give any
particular description of them.Second, those places distinguished in the kingdom of Morocco, including
Sous, Draha, and Tafilett.Tefza, a Berber name, which, according to some, signifies "sand," and to
others, "a bundle of straw," is the capital of the province of Todla,
built by the aborigines on the <DW72> of the Atlas, who surrounded it
with a high wall of sandstone (called, also, Tefza.)At two miles east
of this is the smaller town of Efza, which is a species of suburb,
divided from Tefza by the river Derna.The latter place is inhabited
certainly by Berbers, whose women are famous for their woollen works and
weaving.Tefza is also celebrated for its native black and white woollen
manufactures.The population of the two places is stated at upwards of
10,000, including 2,000 Jews.Pitideb, or Sitideb, is another fine town in the neighbourhood, built by
the Amazirghs on the top of a high mountain.The inhabitants are
esteemed the most civilized of their nation, and governed by their own
elders and chiefs, they live in a state of almost republican
independence.Some good native manufactures are produced, and a large
commerce with strangers is carried on.The women are reputed as being
extremely fair and fascinating.Ghuer, or Gheu, (War, _i.e._, "difficult?")is a citadel, or rather a
strong, massive rock, and the most inaccessible of all in Morocco,
forming a portion of the mountains of Jedla, near the sources of the Wad
Omm-Erbegh.This rocky fort is the residence of the supreme Amrgar, or
chief of the Amazirghs, who rendered himself renowned through the empire
by fighting a pitch-battle with the Imperial troops in 1819.Such chiefs
and tribes occasion the weakness of the interior; for, whenever the
Sultan has been embroiled with European Powers, these aboriginal
Amazirghs invariably seized the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and
ancient grudges.The Shereefs always compound with them, if they can,
these primitive tribes being so many centres of an _imperium imperio_,
or of revolt and disaffection.Tijijet in the province of Dukkalah, situate on the left bank of the
river Omm-Erbegh, along the route from Fez to Morocco, is a small town,
but was formerly of considerable importance.A famous market for grain is held here, which is attended by the tribe
of the Atlas: the country abounds in grain and cattle of the finest
breed.Bulawan or Bou-el-Awan, "father of commodious ways or journeys," is a
small town of 300 houses, with an old castle, formerly a place of
consequence; and lying on an arm of the river Omm-Erbegh _en route_ from
Morocco to Salee and Mequinez and commanding the passage of the river.It is 80 miles from Morocco, and 110 from Salee.On the opposite side of
the river, is the village of Taboulaunt, peopled mostly with Jews and
ferrymen.Soubeit is a very ancient city on the left bank of the Omm-Erbegh,
surrounded with walls, and situate twenty miles from El-Medina in a
mountainous region abounding with hares; it is inhabited by a tribe of
the same name, or probably Sbeita, which is also the name of a tribe
south of Tangier.Meramer is a city built by the Goths on a fertile plain, near Mount
Beni-Megher, about fourteen miles east of Saffee, in the province of
Dukkala, and carrying on a great commerce in oil and grain.El-Medina is a large walled populous city of merchants and artizans, and
capital of the district of Haskowra; the men are seditious, turbulent
and inhospitable; the women are reputed to be fair and pretty, but
disposed, when opportunity offers, to confer their favours on strangers.There is another place four miles distant of nearly the same name.Tagodast is another equally large and rich city of the province of
Haskowra crowning the heights of a lofty mountain surrounded by four
other mountains, but near a plain of six miles in extent, covered with
rich vegetation producing an immense quantity of Argan oil, and the
finest fruits.This place contains about 7,000 inhabitants, who are a noble and
hospitable race.Besides, Argan oil, Tagodast is celebrated for its red
grapes, which are said to be as large as hen's eggs--the honey of
Tagodast is the finest in Africa.Dimenet or Demnet is a considerable town, almost entirely populated by
the Shelouhs and Caraaite Jews; it is situate upon the <DW72>s of a
mountain of the same name, or Adimmei, in the district of Damnat,
fifteen miles distant from Wad Tescout, which falls into the Tensift.The inhabitants are reputed to be of a bad and malignant character, but,
nevertheless, learned in Mussulman theology, and fond of disputing with
foreigners.Orthodoxy and morality are frequently enemies of one
another, whilst good-hearted and honest people are often hetherodox in
their opinions.Aghmat, formerly a great and flourishing city and capital of the
province of Rhamna, built by the Berbers, and well fortified--is now
fallen into decay, and consists only of a miserable village inhabited by
some sixty families, among which are a few Jews--Aghmat lies at the foot
of Mount Atlas, on the road which conducts to Tafilett, near a river of
the same name, and in the midst of a fine country abounding in orchards
and vine-yards; Aghmat was the first capital of the Marabout dynasty.Fronga is a town densely populated almost entirely by Shelouhs and Jews,
lying about fifteen miles from the Atlas range upon an immense plain
which produces the finest grain in Morocco.Tednest, the ancient capital of the province of Shedmah, and built by
the Berbers, is deliciously placed upon a paridisical plain, and was
once the residence of the Shereefs.It contains a population of four
thousand souls, one thousand eight hundred being Jews occupied with
commerce, whilst the rest cultivate the land.This is a division of
labour amongst Mahometans and Israelites not unfrequent in North Africa.But, as in Europe, the Jew is the trader, not the husbandman.Tekoulet is a small and pretty town, rising a short distance from the
sea, by the mouth of the stream Dwira, in the province of Hhaha.The
water is reckoned the best in the province, and the people are honest
and friendly; the Jews inhabit one hundred houses.Tesegdelt, is another city of the province of Hhaha, very large and
rich, perched high upon a mountain, and that fortified by nature.The
principal mosque is one of the finest in the empire.Tagawost is a city, perhaps the most ancient, and indeed the largest of
the province of Sous.It is distant ten miles from the great river Sous,
and fifty from the Atlas.The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of
stone.Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good
workmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all
engaged in continual hostilities with one another.The men are, however,
honest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish.Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was
born in this city.Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.Fedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,
reclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,
and contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by
republican institutions.It is twenty miles E.N.E.Beneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the
Atlas.It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the
southern Atlas.Beni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of
Draha, and a small place, but populated and commercial.On the river of
the same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.Tatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,
situate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous
for the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.Tatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg.Akka consists of two hundred houses,
inhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews.The environs are highly
cultivated.Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the
foot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg.Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built
by the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all
the cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by
respective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews.Cities are also divided
in this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha.The sea on the
coast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber.The town is named Assah, and
distant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses
on each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea.The place
is of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,
to which many people resort.Assah is
also the name of the district though which the Sous river flows.The
Bas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper
part of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of
Sous.Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about
six hundred people.Talent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber
termination.The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr.It is a strong city, and capital of the province
of Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous.This province is sometimes
called Tesset, or Tissert.A portion of it is also denominated
Blad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded
in 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa.This
prince was the bug-bear of Captain Riley.The district contains upwards
of twenty-five thousand Shelouhs and industrious Arabs.Talent is the
residence of the prince, and is situate on the declivity of a hill, not
far from the river Wad-el-Mesah, or Messa, and a mile from Ilekh, or
Ilirgh, a populous village, where there is a famous sanctuary, resorted
to by the Mahometans of the surrounding regions, of the name of Sidi
Hamed-ou-Mousa, (probably Ben Mousa).The singularity of this sacred
village is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population.But
they seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of
North Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange
of the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European
articles of use and luxury.Shtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or,
as stated by Davidson, a _district_.The fact is, many African districts
are called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice
versa_.This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is
inhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a
Sheikh, nearly independent of Morocco.On Talent and Shtouka, Mr."There is no town called
Stuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is
Tilin.The Mesah flows through Stuka, in which district are twenty
settlements, or rather towns, some of which are large.They are known in
general by the names of the Sheikhs who inhabit them.I stopped at
Sheikh Hamed's.Tilin was distant from this spot a day's journey in the
mountains towards the source of the river.If by Talent, Tissert is
meant, Oferen (a town) is distant six miles."On the province of Sous generally, Don J.A.Conde has this note:--

"In this region (Sous) near the sea, is the temple erected in honour of
the prophet Jonas; it was there he was cast out of the belly of the
whale."This temple, says Assed Ifriki, is made of the bones of whales
which perish on this coast.A little further on, he alludes to the
breaking of horses, and being skilful in bodily exercises, for the Moors
and Numidians have always been renowned in that respect.In the lesser and more remote towns, I have followed generally the
enumeration of Count Graeberg, but there are many other places on the
maps, with varieties of names or differences of position.Our geography
of the interior of Morocco, especially in the South, is still very
obscure, and I have only selected those towns and places of whose
present existence there is no question.My object, in the above
enumeration, has been simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of
the population and resources of this country.Of the strength and number
of the tribes of the interior, we know scarcely anything.The names of
the towns and villages of the South, so frequently beginning and ending
with T., sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the Berber
population, under the names of Shelouh or Amazirgh, whilst the great
error of writers has been to represent the Arabs as more numerous than
this aboriginal population.Monsieur E. Renou, in his geographical description of the Empire of
Morocco (Vol.of the "Exploration Scientifique," &c.)foolishly
observes that there is no way of arriving at correct statistics of this
empire, except by comparing it with Algeria; and then remarks, which is
true enough, "Malheureusement, la population de l'Algerie n'est pas
encore bien connue."When, however, he asserts that the numbers of
population given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost
unpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with
him from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary
countries generally.Jackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen
millions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to.Graeberg
estimates it at eight millions and a half.But how, or why, or
wherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine.Certain
it is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely
represent one million of inhabitants.But for those who like to see
something more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the
estimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those
of Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason.Graeberg thus classifies and
estimates the population.Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000
  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000
  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.3,550,000
  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.740,000
  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500
  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000
  Europeans and Christians                      300
  Renegades                                     200
                                         ----------
                Total                     8,500,000

If two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will
have something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco.It
is hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being
simply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs.I am quite sure there
are no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.Of the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting
cluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq.Shaw mentions them as "a knot
of villagers," noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the
western province of Algeria with dates.We have now more ample
information of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an
agglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are
Maiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega
twelve hundred.The others vary from one or two hundred houses.The
villages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a
quarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf ("river
of the wild boar") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing
varieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round
with prickly-pears.Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides
barley sufficient for consumption.The Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with
inexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by
means of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an
hour.The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the
falling of sand in the hour-glass.Some of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well
built; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,
and the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,
appointed by the Sultan of Morocco.These Saharan villages are eternally
in strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms.On this account,
they are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.The immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of
all life in the desert.But the imaginations of the people are not
satisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause
lies deeply in the human heart.They say, however, their ancestors were
cursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and
this was his anathema, "God make you, until the day of judgment, like
wool-comber's cards, the one gnawing the other!"Their wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and
fruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts
of the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed.They have,
besides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a
long time established.But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and
various branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial
relations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,
generally prosperous.London Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor's garden, and the Argan
Forests.--Another interview with the Governor of Mogador on the
Anti-Slavery Address.--Opinion of the Moors on the Abolition of Slavery.We have at times imported into Mogador a stray London Jew or so, of the
lower lemon-selling sort.These lads from the Minories, are highly
exasperated against the Moors for treating them with so much contempt.Indeed, a high-spirited London Jew-boy will not stop at Mogador, though
the adult merchant will, to get money, for mankind often learn baseness
with age, and pass to it through a golden door.One of these Jew-boys,
being cursed by a man, naturally cursed him again, "an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth."Willshire did not think so; and, on the
complaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into
a Moorish prison, where he remained for some days.This is one more
instance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where
everything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government
authorities.A fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the
rich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being
built chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood.The Governor
got up, and went to the scene of "conflagration;" he cracked a few jokes
with the people and went home to bed.The Moors were sorry the fire did
not extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few
of the merchant's goods.Elton, with other friends, to spend the day
in the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)
sometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours' ride south from
Mogador.The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of
Deeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well
as night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain
having fallen up the country, though none on the coast.These Barbary
streams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of
Job, "deceitful as a brook."To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;
to-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,
covers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is
concealed.Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having
their source in mountains.The book of Job may also refer to the
disappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and
thirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,
and so perish.The country in the valley of the Emperor's garden offers nothing
remarkable.Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos
and Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all
that broke the monotony of a perfect waste.There were no cultivated
lands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents
this desolate aspect.We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,
which the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,
the mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious
surge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no
more nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching
them the mercy of God!the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful
patriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad
sinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an
African sun.A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be
contemplated than a large and lofty branching tree; in its boughs and
leaves, endlessly varying, matted together and intersecting each other,
we see the palpable image of infinity.But in the dry and hot climate of
Africa, this tree is a luxury which cannot be appreciated in Europe.We sat under its fresh shade awhile, gazing with security at the bright
fires of the sun, radiating over and through all visible nature.To
check our enthusiasm, we had strewn at our feet old broken bottles and
crockery, the _debris_ and classic relics of former visitors, who were
equally attentive to creature-comforts as to the grandeur of the Argan
monarch of the surrounding forest.The Emperor's garden contains a well of water and a few fruit-trees, on
the trunk of one of which, a fine fig-tree, were carved, in durable
bark, the names of European visitors.Among the rest, that of a famous
_belle_, whose gallant worshippers had cut her name over all its broad
trunk, though they may have failed to cut their own on the plastic and
india-rubber tablet of the fair one's heart.This carving on the
fig-tree is the sum of all that Europeans have done in Morocco during
several ages.We rather adopt Moorish habits, and descend to their
animal gratifications than inculcate our own, or the intellectual
pleasures of Christian nations.European females brought up in this
country, few excepted, adopt with gusto the lascivious dances of the
Mooresses; and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the
male class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of
their passions?While reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor
related to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these
wilds.At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who
prevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before
them in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and
voluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed
this way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend
to his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.On another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every
leaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid
earth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were
seen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills
among _parterres_ of roses and jessamines.The boughs of the Argan tree
also suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with
luscious fruit; but, on weary travellers descending to slake their
parching thirst and refresh themselves, they fell headlong into the
gaping holes of the ground, and disappeared in the abyss of the dark
entrails of the world.These Argan forests continued under the fearful ban of the enchantress
and wicked jinns, until a holy man was brought from the farthest desert
upon the back of a flying camel, who set free the spell-bound wood by
tying on each bewitched tree a small piece of cork bark on which was
inscribed the sacred name of the Deity.The legends of these haunted
Argan forests remind us of the enchanted wood of Tasso, whose
enchantment was dissolved by the gallant knight, Rinaldo, and which
enabled the Crusaders to procure wood for the machines of war to assault
and capture the Holy City.Two quotations will shew the universality and
permanence of superstition, begotten of human hopes and fears.Such is
the beautiful imagery devoted to superstitious musings, by the
illustrious bard:--

  "While, like the rest, the knight expects to hear
  Loud peals of thunder breaking on his ear,
  A dulcet symphony his sense invades,
  Of nymphs, or dryads, warbling through the shades.Soft sighs the breeze, soft purls the silver rill.The feathered choir the woods with music fill;
  The tuneful swan in dying notes complains;
  The mourning nightingale repeats her strains,
  Timbrels and harps and human voices join,
  And in one concert all the sounds combine!"Then for the streamlets and flowerets--

  "Where'er he treads, the earth her tribute pours,
  In gushing springs, or voluntary flowers.Here blooms the lily; there the fragrant rose;
  Here spouts a fountain; there a riv'let flows;
  From every spray the liquid manna trills,
  And honey from the softening bark distills.Again the strange the pleasing sound he hears,
  Of plaints and music mingling in his ears;
  Yet naught appears that mortal voice can frame.Nor harp, nor timbrel, whence the music came."I had another interview with the Governor on Anti-Slavery subjects.Treppass accompanied me, and assisted to interpret.His Excellency was
very condescending, and even joked about his own slaves, asking me how
much I would give him for them.He then continued:--"I am happy to see
you before your departure.Whilst you have been here, I have heard
nothing of your conduct but what was just and proper.You are a quiet
and prudent man, [28] and I am sorry I could not assist you in your
business (abolition).The Sultan will be glad that you and I have not
quarrelled, but are friends."I then asked His Excellency if a person
were to come direct from our Government, with larger powers and
presents, he would have a better chance of success.The Governor
replied, "Not the least whatever.You have done all that could have been
done.We look at the subject, not the persons.The Sultan will never
listen to anybody on this subject.You may cut off his head, but cannot
convince him.If all the Christians of the world were to come and take
this country, then, of course, the Mussulmen would yield the question to
superior force, to the decree of God, but not till then."Myself.--"How is it, Sidi, that the Bey of Tunis, and the Imaum of
Muscat have entered into engagements with Christians for the suppression
of slavery, they being Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"I'll tell you; we Mussulmen are as bad as you Christians.Some of our people go to one mosque,
and will not go to another.They are foolish (_mahboul_).So it is with
the subject of slaves.Some are with you, but most are with me.The Bey
of Tunis, and the Imaum have a different opinion from us.They think
they are right, and we think we are right; but we are as good as they."Myself.--"Sidi, does not the Koran encourage the abolition of slavery,
and command it as a duty to all pious Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"No, it does not command it, but those who voluntarily
liberate their slaves are therein commended, and have the blessing of
God on them."[29]

Myself.--"Sidi, is it in my power to do anything for you in London?"The Governor.--"Speak well of me, that is all.Tell your friends I did
all I could for you."I may mention the opinions of the more respectable Moors, as to the
mission.They said, "If you had managed your mission well, the Sultan
would have received your Address; your Consul is slack; the French
Consul is more active, because he is not the Sultan's merchant.Our
Sultan must receive every person, even a beggar, because God receives
all.You would not have obtained the liberation of our slaves, but the
Sultan would have promised you everything.All that emanates from the
English people is good this we are certain of; but it would have been
better had you come with letters from the Bey of Tunis, shewing what had
been done in that country."Treppass is also of the opinion, that a
deputation of several persons, accompanied with some presents for the
Emperor and his ministers, would have produced a better effect, by
making an appearance of shew and authority, suitable to the ideas of the
people.[30] If coming direct from Government, it would have greater
weight.He thinks, besides, there are a good number of Moors who are favourable
to abolition.Of the connexion between the east and Morocco, he says,
all the Barbary States look up to the Sultan of Constantinople as to a
great authority, and during the last few years, an active
correspondence, on religious matters, has been carried on between
Morocco and Constantinople, chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the
name of Yousef.If the Turkish Sultan, therefore, would _bona-fide_
abolish the slave-markets, I have no doubt this would produce an
impression in Morocco favourable to abolition.During the time I was in Morocco, I distributed some Arabic tracts,
translated from the English by Professor Lee of Cambridge, on the
abolition of slavery.A few Arabic Bibles and Hebrew New Testaments were
also placed at my disposal for circulation by the Societies.I also
wrote an Anti-slavery circular to the British merchants of Mogador, on
Lord Brougham's Act.El-Jereed, the Country of Dates.--Its hard soil.--Salt Lake.Its vast

country of the palm branches, is a part of the Sahara, or the hot dry
country lying in the immediate vicinity of the Great Desert.Its
principal features of soil and climate offer nothing different from
other portions of the Sahara, or the Saharan regions of Algeria and
Morocco.The Belad-el-Jereed, therefore, may be properly called the
Tunisian Sahara.Shaw observes generally of Jereed:--"This part of the
country, and indeed the whole tract of land which lies between the
Atlantic and Egypt, is by most of the modern geographers, called
Biledulgerid, a name which they seem to have borrowed from
Bloid-el-Jeridde, of the Arabians, who merely signify the dry country;
though, if we except the Jeridde, a small portion of it which is situate
on this side of Lesser Syrtis, and belongs to the Tunisians, all the
rest of it is known by no other general name than the Sahara or Sahra,
among those Arabs, at least, whom I have conversed with."Besides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branching
palms, whose dark depending slender leaves, are depicted by the Arabian
poet as hanging gracefully like the dishevelled ringlets of a beautiful
woman in distress, there is the vast salt lake, El-Sibhah, or literally
the "salt plain," and called by some modern geographers the
Sibhah-el-Soudeeat, or Lake of Marks, from having certain marks made of
the trunks of the palm, to assist the caravans in their marches across
its monotonous samelike surface.This vast lake, or salt plain, was divided by the ancients into three
parts, and denominated respectively, Palus Tritonis, Palus Pallas, and
Palus Libya.The first is derived from the river Triton, which according
to Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, is made to pass through this
lake in its course to the sea, but which is the present river Ghobs,
where it falls into the Mediterranean.The name Pallas is derived from
the tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic
expeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the
Jereed.The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy
English miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection
of water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,
interspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and
extent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in
the particular season."At first, on crossing it," says a tourist, "the grass and bushes become
gradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,
becomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt.This, as you
advance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and
unbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or
other sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in
depth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and
concentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except
with a pickaxe.The horse's shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its
stone-like surface."The salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and
not adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very
agreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of
commerce.The Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as
pieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic
inscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and
undoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no
difficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.The trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.The quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to
foreign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round
numbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.But in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year
entirely on dates."A great number of poles," says Sir Grenville Temple, "are arranged
across the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,
and from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which
compose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the
room is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,
also filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the
jar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick
luscious syrup.It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more
palatable than this'sweet of sweets.'"As we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must
needs give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that
the information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in
some respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa.The
date-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of
North Africa.They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown
trees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or
seven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require
sixteen years to produce fruit.The date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires
communication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid.The age of the
palm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the
Tunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy
years, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them
fifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin
gradually to wither away.But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that
the date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a
hundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before
it withers!The only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in
four or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin
to droop and wither.Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know
that the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain.In
many localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry
season; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm
grows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring.The sap, or
honey of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite
fresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp
taste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating.It is called
poetically _leghma_, "tears" of the dates.When a tree is found not to
produce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped
out of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is
drunk in its pure state without any other preparation.If the tree be
not exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,
at the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped.The palm
is capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be
easily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a
narrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is
allowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.This sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_
or _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,
or what we should call _toddy_.It is usual for persons of distinction
to entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,
with this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose.It
would appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a
cornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,
representing a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was
placed.Dates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,
which will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most
valuable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently
make it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.Certain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal
virtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,
and oil, make an excellent salad.The heart of the tree, which lies at
top between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is
eaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses
a delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.The palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,
superseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes
of the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of
other purposes.The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other
nick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are
made and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when
hardened by age, is used for building.Indeed, we may say, it is the all
and everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the
desert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the
palm_.The Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the
palm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made
for them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,
the palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former
infidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined
away, and died."God," adds the pious Mussulman, "has given us the palm;
amongst the Christians, it will not grow!"But the poetry of the palm is
an inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town
scenery.The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with
the great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred
leaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a
hermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the
serenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely
palm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or
planted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.I must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting
this extraordinary tree.And, after this, I further refer the reader to
a Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding
pages.A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely
less attention than a vineyard.The trees are generally planted in a
_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from
each other of four or five yards.The situation selected is mostly on
the banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring
hills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the
plants and the finer the fruit.For this tree, which loves a warm
climate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent
irrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of
little consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as
in the Jereed.Irrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer.The
water is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual
tree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and
fenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained
there until it soaks into the earth.(All irrigation is, indeed,
effected in this way.)As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit
of one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels' loads of
dates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the
load, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars.Besides the
Jereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country.Jackson says,
"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and
extensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and
picturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the
admiring eye.In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a
horseman may gallop through them without impediment."Our readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description
of the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr.I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,
as botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm
in this respect is just like the human being.The _female_ palm alone
produces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the
_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that
those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in
proportion.In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male
plants which grow wild in the Desert.They hang and shake them over the
female plants, usually in February or March.Koempfe says, that the male
flowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this
state, perform their office, though kept to the following year.The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,
Government deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants.It is visited
every year by the "Bey of the Camp," who administers affairs in this
country as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the
Tunisian throne.Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the
"Bey of the Camp" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his
successor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other
members of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from
father to son, only on the principle of age.At least, this has been the
general rule of succession for many years.The duties of the "Bey of the Camp" is to visit with a "flying-camp,"
for the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of
the Regency.I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,
extracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various
observations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of
Toser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.Tour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr.Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--
Plain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish
Infantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--
Administration of Justice.--The Bey's presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.Hot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr.Richard
Reade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay
their respects to Sidi Mohammed, "Bey of the Camp," and to thank him for
his condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed.The
Bey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, "Guarda-pipa," which
they did in the evening.At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,
one of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head.The Bey
proceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay
charger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of
the troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was
covered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of
attendants, in glorious confusion.The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes
  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20

  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who
  guard the entrance of the Bey's
  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20

  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,
  who are always about the Bey's
  tent, and must be of this country               20

  Turkish Infantry                               300
  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300
  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000
                                               -----
             Total                             2,660

This is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march
they were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of
honorary welcome for the Bey.As they proceeded, the force of the
camp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the
parties going home to their respective tribes.We may notice the total
absence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm.This may have been to
avoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of
the force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected.The
summer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and
other neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.Besides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery.The
band attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,
kettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the
report of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical
discord.After a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.Through the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four
miles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace.The
Turkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted
troops.Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our
respects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, "Guardapipa," as
interpreter.His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for
anything we wanted.Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey's
doctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our
whole tour it is impossible to speak too highly.The doctor had with him
an assistant, and tent to himself.Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several
other Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.About half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square
white house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,
or saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition.They told
us to go on, and joined us soon after.Two hours after us, the Turkish
Agha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men.The
Bey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the
shape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of
state.After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired.The Agha
was saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his
infantry after us.We retired for the night at about eight o'clock.The form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen
very large tents, was as follows:--The Bey's tent in the centre, which
was surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the
Bash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,
Haznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;
then further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the
Bash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with
the cookery establishment.Among the attendants of the Bey were the
"guarda-pipa," guard of the pipe, "guarda-fusile," guard of the gun,
"guarda-cafe," guard of the coffee, "guarda-scarpe," guard of the shoes,
[32] and "guarda-acqua," guard of water.A man followed the Bey about
holding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers
on its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels.There
was also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the
most extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd.The Bey did
not smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis.None of his ladies ever accompany him in
these expeditions.The tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each.Our tent consisted
of our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the
horses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain
Balfour's Maltese, called Michael.The first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we
slept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab
sentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the
camels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost
to drive away slumber from our eyelids.We halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few
things from Tunis which we had neglected to bring.But before returning,
we ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.The guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a
Genoese by birth, but now a renegade.In this country they do not know
what a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning
early, and wait till twelve or one o'clock, when they take a hearty
meal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the
season.Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told
him our object.We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to
pay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions.His
Highness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.On coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all
night.In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents
would not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always
struck at 3 o'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise
to great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest
part of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial
for the health of the men.The reason, however, was, to enable the
camels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular
and continual, is very slow.Of a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.The camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,
packing camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his
Highness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down.The music
was incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the
irregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally
rushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,
reloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.The order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along
about one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who
follow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the
Turkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of
the road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the
water-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry
countries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all
which, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,
or Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness.This done, the Bey gallops off to
the right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most
game--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place
and marches to the next halting-place.One morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback.Rade, "he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom
missed his game."As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they
remarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was
buried there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent
had been discovered.Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of
the remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct.The march was only from six to
eight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah.At day-break, at noon, at
3 o'clock, P.M.and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near
the door of the Bey's tent the hour of prayer.An aide-de-camp also
proclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the
morrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat
them whenever they can lay hands upon them.Captain B. was fortunate in
not bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him.The
Arabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not
partaken of by us.The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn
them into hares by dexterous cooking.The mornings and evenings we found
cold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.We left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only
their tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being
covered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them.The Arabs
were seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting
and pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and
bellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena.He was shot by a mameluke, Si
Smyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood.He was a fine
fellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog.They put him on a
mule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey.When R. arrived at the
camp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that
he would not eat the brain.There is a superstitious belief among the
Moors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes
mad.The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely
attacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only
chained up.He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large
in the woods.The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.Our tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does
not like the sandy and open country of the plain.Very thick brushwood,
and ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his
haunts.Several Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they
had charge.The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,
standing one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet
tied behind him.In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis
is a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being
never performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches.It is
very rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never
did.It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be
overlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes
in this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going
barefoot upon the sharpest stones.Severe punishments of any kind are
rarely inflicted in Tunis.The country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to
dissipate its savage appearance.The women of a few Arab horsehair tents
(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their
shrill looloos.We passed the
ruins of several towns and other remains.The camels were always driven
into camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,
or one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are
made to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait
and moody character.We continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,
and encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.One morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very
high and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge
remained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable
_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater
difficulty.Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the
disinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,
the camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way
of Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch
which would scarcely cost a thousand piastres!This stream or river is
the same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive
plain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or
circular villages of the Arabs dotted about.We saw hares, but, the
ground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few.Bevies
of partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them.In the evening,
the Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten
miles, and halted at Ben Sayden.The following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;
saw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,
but the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged
partridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot.Our
ride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for
the few inhabitants.After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and
bagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,
the Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm
had befallen us.On leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,
on which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.North Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along
our entire route.We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as
several single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did
not grace our supper with any.Saw several birds called Kader, about the
size of a partridge, but we shot none.A good many hares and partridges
either crossed our path or whirred over our heads.Passed over a running
stream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,
but in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in
good repair.Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in
which are laid the ashes of a saint.We had seen many such in the hills;
indeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more
frequently on elevations.We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish
infantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars
compared to the Arabs.On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,
and some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords
and small wooden and metal shields before the Bey.The officers kissed
the hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must
call their tumtums and squeaking-pipes.This ceremony took place every
morning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours.They
kept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by
their eternal cry of "Alleya," which means, "Be off," or "Keep your
distance!"These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will
soon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the
once formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of
course, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be
most unshaken.As we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little
cultivation.An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,
however, there was some undulating ground.Passed a good stone bridge;
were supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were
many droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and
gazelles.One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds
caught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good
half of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to
make a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate
creature savagely down.There were several good courses after hares,
though her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the
dogs and heading her in every possible way.Prince Pueckler
Muskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835.The town is clean, but
many houses are in ruins.The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham
are quartered here.The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to
enter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from
Giovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples.The
house of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.Going along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our
attendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned
man, and who taught Mr.R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,
jumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and
then seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave
the ragged ruffian-like saint.At last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of
exceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness
must have done the same.The saint accompanied us to the Kaed's house;
and, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping
on account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the
guards of the camp.We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats
which had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,
as we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the
sweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and
other jargon.We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by
order of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be
deposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure
of visiting his future burial-place.In this city, a lineal descendant
of the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the
essential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint.Saints of
one order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,
whom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call
_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing
with their habits of fleecing the poor people.Sidi Amour Abeda's hands
ought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with
devout and slavering obeisance.The renegade doctor of the Bey told us
that the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to
see us English infidels burnt alive.Fanaticism seems to be the native
growth of the human heart!We afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a
curiosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up
the water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the
drinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage
to all holy Mohammedan cities.We returned to the Kaed's, and sat down to a capital dinner.The old
Governor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with
him, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted.We visited
the fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi
Reschid, an artillery-officer.We then returned to the camp, and found
Santa Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,
employed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.He was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey.It was given
out, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and
Tripoli, by his Government.He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular
as some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of
us, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it
like a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey's tent in person, and
asking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.We went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,
morning and evening, whilst at Kairwan.There were many plaintiffs, but
no defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary
manner.To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to
obtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs.The Bey,
being in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who
drove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked
("taba,") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey's property.It was
a curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot
iron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late
different owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants
of the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of
necessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice.About two
hundred changed hands in this way.The Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out.He
has overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;
these let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,
at so much per head.The overseers annually render an account of them to
Government, and, when called upon, supply the number required.At this
time, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had
been very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just
mentioned.If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted
thirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin
districts, the Bey's acquisition in this way is considerable.A few
years ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty
camels, the duty for which the Bey remitted.The camel, if ever so
healthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never
supersede the labour of mules.The camel is only useful where there are
vast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,
and some parts of the East Indies.A hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey
for inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,
firing off their long guns.We crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many
gallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,
unless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except
found asleep.On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs
caught.R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he
was insulted by an Arab.R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the
Bey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and
to be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up
and generously begged him off.This is the end of most bastinados in the
country.We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some
persons, and was very dangerous.A muddy stream, they add, is often very
fatal to travellers.The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a
handsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the
Frenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to
the Bey's mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.Under such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.The Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,
with black wings, and flies like a plover.We had a large
hawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,
which sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.Marched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an
ancient town.Shaw says, "Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum
Chilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla.We have
here the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some
other fragments of large buildings.According to the tradition of the
Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle
pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing
hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground.For Ja Elma
signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!'an expression we are to
imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream."During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.We proceeded about
twenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah.This river
comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp
arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district
to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched.When
we arrived, the water had just come.We saw warrens of hares, and caught
many with the dogs.Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was
fired at, and went off scampering on three legs.The hawks caught a
beautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the
small hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of
long white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,
which they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye.A curious
prickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its
leaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert.The Bey made R. a
present of the hobara.One day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.'s greyhound,
which behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every
now and then attacking him in the hind-quarters.Saw seven or eight
hobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a
gazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an
Arab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating
"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of
the saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once
thickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more
Arabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of
horses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an
opportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of
hobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,
also some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;
after a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging
out of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,
but which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out
from its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,
catches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the
other; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the
other, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon
a herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the
gazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely
time to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of
which lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of
strong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we
started a great number.We saw another description of bird, called
rhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more
swiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient
Roman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen
miles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign
of such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates
which they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;
some remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct
leading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and
following it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the
camels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which
the soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly
thorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,
chopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the
chiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,
riding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These
palanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,
tinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance
makes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine
horses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were
joined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"
and kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them
managed themselves and their arms and horses with great address,
balancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,
throwing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once
losing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;
two of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful
gash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and
looked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in
view of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and
green after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a
range of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with
dirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally
hot and mineral waters.Although the Moors, by their religion, are
enjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change
their linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,
however, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the
neighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their
hahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women
are often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs
extended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and
continuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the
phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were
observed by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities
besides them.Shaw says: "'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'
and the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of
the mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like
quality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they
become cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville
Temple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five
degrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in
this stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and
resemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce
mentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of
Feriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and
pieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it
one half the natural size:

[Illustration]

The snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut
represents the snake half its natural size:

[Illustration]

The fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the
hot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates
that, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot
waters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the
apprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the
Gulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or
80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]

Many a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,
since water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all
regions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or
cooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be
no physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our
tourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily
irrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous
riches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning
simoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about
charming our Boab.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the
middle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing
the while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after
several attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach
something in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of
holy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish
next spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed
him down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also
his head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of
this sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented
the holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed's house; this
functionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch
of the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was
not a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,
upon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of
ruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an
irregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in
perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a
building is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;
the Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors
endeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,
even in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their
troops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an
earnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The
oil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between
stones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of
paste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub
with water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they
skim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,
they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;
the stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of
the oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below
where this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a
girl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed
herself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by
some twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took
off our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited
curiosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and
wished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces
with amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two
women screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one
of them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with
handlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,
something like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped
like a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of
large jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like
the guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a
young hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly
more like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in
with a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or
Jerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the
sovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of
Tunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if
asking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their
republic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance
like the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they
get nitre.The water which we drank was
brought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched
across a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was
congealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among
which also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called
Ghorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of
which grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and
reminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North
Africa are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the
presence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the
soil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being
occasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,
nearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the
ground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were
unusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of
about two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the
camp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious
spring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called
mokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and
of a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this
bird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on
the ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the
surface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when
it opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering
another series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it
rises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was
now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,
watered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade
of the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and
beauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the
towns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most
humbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped
just beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft
spar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline
effloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only
birds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We
particularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,
at a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry

arrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate
the famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as
far as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond
these and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an
immeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could
have sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before
entering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before
the Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with
open mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey
left his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his
Highness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had
also a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be
found in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable
assemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams
and the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the
date-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,
all of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt
new vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and
were surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the
date-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs
of Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable
town of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its
neighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the
traveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his
tent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of
_mud-houses_."Shaw,
who says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and
rafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been
made of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very
natural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was
the finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large
as Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and
crenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a
market-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare
on the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have
flat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part
built from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from
the common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old
houses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or
sun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little
rocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called
_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself
afterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having
irrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the
sand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are
insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water
from Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,
Abbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou
Lifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit
their grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,
Oulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the
finest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The
dead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,
more decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed
sepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents
the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted
the leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked
it.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the
evening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the
Jereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which
his Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here
is the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready
for the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each
date-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum
when the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is
very rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only
food here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its
stead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman
carried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's
officers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they
attended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing
for the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from
the burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and
found it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is
pretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are
supplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,
but with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his
taking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was
a large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,
hardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in
Toser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly
so; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The
neighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air
is filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;
the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures
the eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the
preservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of
all sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in
many cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,
particularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in
the Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North
Africa.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called
Jereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my
father;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish
breasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them
under the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making
them as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a
lark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and
shineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely
preferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all
attempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have
failed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive
whilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that
live in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the
same, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of
millstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the
walls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of
grain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with
onions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;
they colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,
though it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were
exceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of
ear-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a
thousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample
bosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low
down as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,
and carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where
they put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged
their hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's
mark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any
animal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,
receiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey
and his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a
mark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance
of a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders
and loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three
legs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as
possible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may
remark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all
the animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell
into the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept
their best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was
moving among them.The bastinadoes with which he
had been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being
applied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving
one hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people
being sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming
to anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He
was then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of
dollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of
Barbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be
found, the owners of them having died before they could point out their
hoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually
in the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing
whatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it
from immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that
under all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men
or demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long
journeys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and
making plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to
convince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with
incredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the
Sahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the
left an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of
liquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus
Libya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh
like the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very
respectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the
Bey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty
or sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort
immediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou
Aly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of
age.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very
clever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent
appearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in
his courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered
dates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which
has the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,
first dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,
which deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh's saint also
distributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as
well as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious
veneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would
not be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian
territories from the south, being five days' journey, or about
thirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'
from Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of
villages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent
of surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages
are Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,
and Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,
takes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of
earth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in
two, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,
and fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a
forest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the
water (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and
luxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group
of villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which
serves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the
aristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The
Shereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom
the Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of
the population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most
towns advanced in the Desert.They
are strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection
of the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the
very opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is
sojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on
condition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not
mount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has
placed the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as
the rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours
towards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the
gate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks
during late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the
Jereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes
place at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a
portion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed
proprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the
tranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the
happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of
Nefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens
are delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit
in the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty
peculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose
themselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route
laid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are
only known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in
these dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the
bordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,
cover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the
well-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while
dying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the
wiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The
weather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the
sky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so
many sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same
way as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot
make him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and
that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has
collected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much
pity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under
the protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone
upwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of
these snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small
bags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags
being extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their
mouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around
their arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile
screaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the
bystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually
perform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar
in their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives
them a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and
date-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is
extensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept
in the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in
passing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound
the poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for
Christians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_
towards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a
species of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is
tossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles
off we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising
perpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the
view was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only
just been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of
tuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first
animal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the
opposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,
prevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a
mass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of
him within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,
and he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our
attempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab
tribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in
the country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the
marks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab
brought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young
ones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though
one of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a
greyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our
want of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least
attended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a
horrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any
game at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic
plants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as
fresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an
ocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath
was water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in
reality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were
apparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps
of sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,
plains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown
together for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless
these savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind
as the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being
perfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming
an essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also
added to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been
coming in to a great amount.The
principal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and
almost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate
sort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are
also the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more
mealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very
fine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness
being attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the
past year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the
tree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions
of the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and
dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up
to R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the
Treasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the
brute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these
fellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,
lascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their
entertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The
Moorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the
French in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a
good old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often
distinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before
Constantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of
Arabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man
has just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For
robbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so
intricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali
brought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is
about a fallowdeer's size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but
long hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over
the fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from
the Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a
range of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought
from some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about
twelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the
excessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the
Government were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of
one was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode
the horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge
for the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and
exceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching
desert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels
reeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before
the tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the
weather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,
for during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three
died four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been
no change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared
the same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,
could not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden
transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of
the next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these
disastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite
unprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,
all the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required
comforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the
death of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which
the poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of
the weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a
soul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,
worthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at
200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better
built than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water
and the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good
as those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here
took our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of
the summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give
an account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to
Tripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke
Arabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from
Toser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued
cold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of
houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up
the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are
all that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses
perished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of
the camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about
two pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of
for four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to
the _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in
a like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good
horse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other
buildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is
seen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of
aqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this
country--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers
to Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be
constructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the
whole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying
water from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the
best and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the
Jereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this
country, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond
an old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from
jealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we
passed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be
remembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,
where are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour's halt,
and when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished
us with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to
Momakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,
the air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little
distance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of
those near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of
the city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse
belonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land
around.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached
to this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the
guard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish
musicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish
airs.We must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns.He
boasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four
at once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat
advanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he
can put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A
certain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her
two suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her
once a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be
separated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money
which he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he
himself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without
assigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum
in the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was
the Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and
injustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our
tourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,
and many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and
find that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned
men, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an
embarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor
creatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford
connubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to
divorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her
husband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself
from her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to
marry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the
Bardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small
date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a
few live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his
return, and both Captain B. and Mr.R. have had every reason to be
extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey
of the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the
Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various
impediments.Our tourists say generally:--

  Camel-loads.[40]
  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I
  imagine, the latter.)23

  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6

  Dates (these were collected at Toser,
    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding
    districts)                                     500
                                                  ----
                 Total                             529

  It is impossible, with this statement
    before us, to make out any exact
    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen
    to twenty-five shillings, say on an
    average a pound sterling; this will
    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads
    at five cantars per load                    L2,500

  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,
    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360
                                                ------
                   Total                        L2,860

The money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to
200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:

  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:
  in goods                                      L2,860
  Ditto, in money:                               6,250
                                                ------
                   Total                        L9,110

To this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and
other beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *

Before leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his
Excellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He
accompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting
until I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and
nearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was
satisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my
cordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during
my residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul
not excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to
accompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his
engagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of
his goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so
closely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the
following day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we
were at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my
journal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,
successive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner
was a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little
water, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely
under water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,
through huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this
time, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little
biscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most
accurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,
would now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and
wrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died
after a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that
died a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]

An aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for
the Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and
comfortably lodged in the Regent's Park.After my return from Africa, I
paid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of
smoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the
Morocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,
written at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the
present time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at
9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French
had taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some
brigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,
and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving
the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the
next morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred
French were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with
the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,
after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and
as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle
killed, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with
others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on
account of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people
from destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,
'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and
preventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to
save, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained
Europeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the
captain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the
Moorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the
British and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even
peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,
upon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband
and wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my
duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving
Mogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,
thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in
some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the
city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would
say, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their
best gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became
dispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,
about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly
all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and
the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to
defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves
of famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the
French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These
wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages
around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of
the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,
assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding
the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in
the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise
exposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his
wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential
was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent
confusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers
appeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by
hundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking
places for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their
rapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular
documents.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and
others setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and
licentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it
was that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight
through the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding
band, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,
insisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her
throat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would
the ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul
having prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at
this juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born
here, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force
to her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the
blood of their countrywomen.The chief of
the party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in
contact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which
the Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative
security.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad
forebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but
not before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a
sabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised
above, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded
it off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the
detested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine
years old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling
out _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson
joined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,
"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the
family, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties
of blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered
by the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,
was a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of
day was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their
condition more precarious.Lucas, who never once
failed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these
imminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most
hazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,
he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

for a few minutes," she said, as she tucked Eleanor under the covers.Then, since she was quite desperate for subjects of conversation, and
still determined by the hot memory of her night's vigil to leave no
stone of geniality unturned, she added:

"This is a book that I am reading to help me to know how to guide and
educate you.I haven't had much experience in adopting children, you
know, Eleanor, and when there is anything in this world that you don't
know, there is usually some good and useful book that will help you to
find out all about it."Even to herself her words sounded hatefully patronizing and pedagogic,
but she was past the point of believing that she could handle the
situation with grace.When Eleanor's breath seemed to be coming
regularly, she put down her book with some thankfulness and escaped to
the tea table, where she poured tea for her aunt, and explained the
child's idiosyncrasies swiftly and smoothly to that estimable lady.Left alone, Eleanor lay still for a while, staring at the design of
pink roses on the blue wall-paper.On Cape Cod, pink and blue were not
considered to be colors that could be combined.There was nothing at
all in New York like anything she knew or remembered.Then
she made her way to the window and picked up the book Beulah had been
reading.It was about _her_, Aunt Beulah had said,--directions for
educating her and training her.The paragraph that caught her eye
where the book was open had been marked with a pencil."This girl had such a fat, frog like expression of face," Eleanor
read, "that her neighbors thought her an idiot.She was found to be
the victim of a severe case of ad-e-noids."As she spelled out the
word, she recognized it as the one Beulah had used earlier in the day.She remembered the sudden sharp look with which the question had been
accompanied.The sick lady for whom she had "worked out" had often
called her an idiot when her feet had stumbled, or she had failed to
understand at once what was required of her.She encountered a text replete with hideous examples
of backward and deficient children, victims of adenoids who had been
restored to a state of normality by the removal of the affliction.She
had no idea what an adenoid was.She had a hazy notion that it was a
kind of superfluous bone in the region of the breast, but her anguish
was rooted in the fact that this, _this_ was the good and useful book
that her Aunt Beulah had found it necessary to resort to for guidance,
in the case of her own--Eleanor's--education.When Beulah, refreshed by a cup of tea and further sustained by the
fact that Margaret and Peter had both telephoned they were coming to
dinner, returned to her charge, she found the stolid, apathetic child
she had left, sprawling face downward on the floor, in a passion of
convulsive weeping.CHAPTER IV

PETER ELUCIDATES


It was Peter who got at the heart of the trouble.Margaret tried, but
though Eleanor clung to her and relaxed under the balm of her gentle
caresses, the child remained entirely inarticulate until Peter
gathered her up in his arms, and signed to the others that he wished
to be left alone with her.By the time he rejoined the two in the drawing-room--he had missed his
after-dinner coffee in the long half-hour that he had spent shut into
the guest room with the child--Jimmie and Gertrude had arrived, and
the four sat grouped together to await his pronouncement.She wants the doll that David left in
that carpetbag of hers he forgot to take out of the 'Handsome cab.'She wants to be loved, and she wants to grow up and write poetry for
the newspapers," he announced."Also she will eat a piece of bread and
butter and a glass of milk, as soon as it can conveniently be provided
for her.""When did you take holy orders, Gram?""How do you
work the confessional?I wish I could make anybody give anything up to
me, but I can't.Did you just go into that darkened chamber and say to
the kid, 'Child of my adoption,--cough,' and she coughed, or are you
the master of some subtler system of choking the truth out of 'em?""Anybody would tell anything to Peter if he happened to want to know
it," Margaret said seriously."Wouldn't they, Beulah?""She wants to be loved," Peter had said.It was so
simple for some people to open their hearts and give out
love,--easily, lightly.She was not made like that,--loving came hard
with her, but when once she had given herself, it was done.Peter
didn't know how hard she had tried to do right with the child that
day."The doll is called the rabbit doll, though there is no reason why it
should be, as it only looks the least tiny bit like a rabbit, and is a
girl.Its other name is Gwendolyn, and it always goes to bed with her.O'Farrels aunt said that children always stopped playing with
dolls when they got to be as big as Eleanor, but she isn't never
going to stop.--You must get after that double negative, Beulah.--She
once wrote a poem beginning: 'The rabbit doll, it is my own.'She
thinks that she has a frog-like expression of face, and that is why
Beulah doesn't like her better.She is perfectly willing to have her
adenoids cut out, if Beulah thinks it would improve her, but she
doesn't want to 'take anything,' when she has it done.""You are a wonder, Gram," Gertrude said admiringly.I have made a mess of it, haven't I?""Yes, she's homesick," Peter said gravely, "but not for anything she's
left in Colhassett.David told you the story, didn't he?--She is
homesick for her own kind, for people she can really love, and she's
never found any of them.Her grandfather and grandmother are old and
decrepit.She feels a terrible responsibility for them, but she
doesn't love them, not really.She's too hungry to love anybody until
she finds the friends she can cling to--without compromise.""An emotional aristocrat," Gertrude murmured."It's the curse of
taste."Jimmie cried, grimacing at Gertrude."Didn't she have
any kids her own age to play with?""She had 'em, but she didn't have any time to play with them.You
forget she was supporting a family all the time, Jimmie.""By jove, I'd like to forget it.""She had one friend named Albertina Weston that she used to run around
with in school.They used to do poetic
'stunts' of one poem a day on some subject selected by Albertina.I
think Albertina was a snob.She candidly admitted to Eleanor that if
her clothes were more stylish, she would go round with her more.Eleanor seemed to think that was perfectly natural.""If I could get one
damsel, no matter how tender her years, to confide in me like that I'd
be happy for life.It's nothing to you with those eyes, and that
matinee forehead of yours; but I want 'em to weep down my neck, and I
can't make 'em do it.""Wait till you grow up, Jimmie, and then see what happens," Gertrude
soothed him."Wait till it's your turn with our child," Margaret said."In two
months more she's coming to you.""Do I ever forget it for a minute?""The point of the whole business is," Peter continued, "that we've got
a human soul on our hands.We imported a kind of scientific plaything
to exercise our spiritual muscle on, and we've got a real specimen of
womanhood in embryo.I don't know whether the situation appalls you as
much as it does me--" He broke off as he heard the bell ring."That's David, he said he was coming."Then as David appeared laden with the lost carpetbag and a huge box of
chocolates, he waved him to a chair, and took up his speech again."I
don't know whether the situation appalls you, as much as it does
me--if I don't get this off my chest now, David, I can't do it at
all--but the thought of that poor little waif in there and the
struggle she's had, and the shy valiant spirit of her,--the sand that
she's got, the _sand_ that put her through and kept her mouth shut
through experiences that might easily have killed her, why I feel as
if I'd give anything I had in the world to make it up to her, and yet
I'm not altogether sure that I could--that we could--that it's any of
our business to try it.""There's nobody else who will, if we don't," David said."That's it," Peter said, "I've never known any one of our bunch to
quit anything that they once started in on, but just by way of
formality there is one thing we ought to do about this proposition
before we slide into it any further, and that is to agree that we want
to go on with it, that we know what we're in for, and that we're
game.""We decided all that before we sent for the kid," Jimmie said, "didn't
we?""We decided we'd adopt a child, but we didn't decide we'd adopt this
one.Taking the responsibility of this one is the question before the
house just at present.""The idea being," David added, "that she's a fairly delicate piece of
work, and as time advances she's going to be _delicater_.""And that it's an awkward matter to play with souls," Beulah
contributed; whereupon Jimmie murmured, "Browning," sotto voice."She may be all that you say, Gram," Jimmie said, after a few minutes
of silence, "a thunderingly refined and high-minded young waif, but
you will admit that without an interpreter of the same class, she
hasn't been much good to us so far.""Good lord, she isn't refined and high-minded," Peter said.She's simply supremely sensitive and full of the most
pathetic possibilities.If we're going to undertake her we ought to
realize fully what we're up against, and acknowledge it,--that's all
I'm trying to say, and I apologize for assuming that it's more my
business than anybody's to say it.""That charming humility stuff, if I could only remember to pull it."The sofa pillow that Gertrude aimed at Jimmie hit him full on the
mouth and he busied himself pretending to eat it.Beulah scorned the
interruption."Of course, we're going to undertake her," Beulah said."We are signed
up and it's all down in writing.If anybody has any objections, they
can state them now."On every young
face was reflected the same earnestness that set gravely on her own."The 'ayes' have it," Jimmie murmured."From now on I become not only
a parent, but a soul doctor."He rose, and tiptoed solemnly toward the
door of Eleanor's room.Beulah called, as he was disappearing
around the bend in the corridor.He turned back to lift an admonitory finger."Shush," he said, "do not interrupt me.I am going to wrap baby up in
a blanket and bring her out to her mothers and fathers."CHAPTER V

ELEANOR ENJOYS HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY


"I am in society here," Eleanor wrote to her friend Albertina, with a
pardonable emphasis on that phase of her new existence that would
appeal to the haughty ideals of Miss Weston, "I don't have to do any
housework, or anything.I sleep under a pink silk bedquilt, and I have
all new clothes.I have a new black pattern leather sailor hat that I
sopose you would laugh at.It cost six dollars and draws the sun down
to my head but I don't say anything.I have six aunts and uncles all
diferent names and ages but grown up.Uncle Peter is the most elderly,
he is twenty-five.I know becase we gave him a birthday party with a
cake.You would
think that was pretty, well it is.There is a servant girl to do evry
thing even passing your food to you on a tray.I wish you could come
to visit me.I stay two months in a place and get broghut up there.Aunt Beulah is peculiar but nice when you know her.She is stric and
at first I thought we was not going to get along.She thought I had
adenoids and I thought she dislikt me too much, but it turned out not.I take lessons from her every morning like they give at Rogers
College, not like publick school.I have to think what I want to do a
good deal and then do it.At first she turned me loose to enjoy myself
and I could not do it, but now we have disapline which makes it all
right.My speling is weak, but uncle Peter says Stevanson could not
spel and did not care.Stevanson was the poat who wrote the birdie
with a yellow bill in the reader.I wish you would tel me if Grandma's
eye is worse and what about Grandfather's rheumatism."P. S. We have a silver organ in all the rooms to have heat in.I was
afrayd of them at first."*       *       *       *       *

In the letters to her grandparents, however, the undercurrent of
anxiety about the old people, which was a ruling motive in her life,
became apparent.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Grandma and Dear Grandpa," she wrote,

"I have been here a weak now.I inclose my salary, fifteen dollars
($15.00) which I hope you will like.I get it for doing evry thing I
am told and being adoptid besides.You can tell the silectmen that I
am rich now and can support you just as good as Uncle Amos.I want
Grandpa to buy some heavy undershurts right of.He will get a couff if
he doesn't do it.Tell him to rub your arm evry night before you go to
bed, Grandma, and to have a hot soapstone for you.If you don't have
your bed hot you will get newmonia and I can't come home to take care
of you, becase my salary would stop.I like New York better now that I
have lived here some.I miss seeing you around, and Grandpa."The cook cooks on a gas stove that is very funny.I asked her how it
went and she showed me it.She is going to leve, but lucky thing the
hired girl can cook till Aunt Beulah gets a nother cook as antyseptic
as this cook.In Rogers College they teach ladies to have their cook's
and hired girl's antyseptic.It is a good idear becase of sickness.I
inclose a recipete for a good cake.You
don't have to stir it much, and Grandpa can bring you the things.Let me hear that you are
all right.Don't forget to put the cat out nights.I hope she is all
right, but remember the time she stole the butter fish.I miss you,
and I miss the cat around.Uncle David pays me my salary out of his
own pocket, because he is the richest, but I like Uncle Peter the
best.He is very handsome and we like to talk to each other the best.*       *       *       *       *

But it was on the varicolored pages of a ruled tablet--with a picture
on its cover of a pink cheeked young lady beneath a cherry tree, and
marked in large straggling letters also varicolored "The Cherry
Blossom Tablet"--that Eleanor put down her most sacred thoughts.On
the outside, just above the cherry tree, her name was written with a
pencil that had been many times wet to get the desired degree of
blackness, "Eleanor Hamlin, Colhassett, Massachusetts.Private Dairy,"
and on the first page was this warning in the same painstaking,
heavily shaded chirography, "This book is sacrid, and not be trespased
in or read one word of.It was the private diary and Gwendolyn, the rabbit doll, and a small
blue china shepherdess given her by Albertina, that constituted
Eleanor's _lares et penates_.When David had finally succeeded in
tracing the ancient carpetbag in the lost and found department of the
cab company, Eleanor was able to set up her household gods, and draw
from them that measure of strength and security inseparable from their
familiar presence.She always slept with two of the three beloved
objects, and after Beulah had learned to understand and appreciate the
child's need for unsupervised privacy, she divined that the little
girl was happiest when she could devote at least an hour or two a day
to the transcribing of earnest sentences on the pink, blue and yellow
pages of the Cherry Blossom Tablet, and the mysterious games that she
played with the rabbit doll.That these games consisted largely in
making the rabbit doll impersonate Eleanor, while the child herself
became in turn each one of the six uncles and aunts, and exhorted the
victim accordingly, did not of course occur to Beulah.It did occur to
her that the pink, blue and yellow pages would have made interesting
reading to Eleanor's guardians, if they had been privileged to read
all that was chronicled there.*       *       *       *       *

"My aunt Beulah wears her hair to high of her forrid."My aunt Margaret wears her hair to slic on the sides."My aunt Gertrude wears her hair just about right."My aunt Margaret is the best looking, and has the nicest way."My aunt Gertrude is the funniest.I never laugh at what she says, but
I have trouble not to.By thinking of Grandpa's rheumaticks I stop
myself just in time.Aunt Beulah means all right, and wants to do
right and have everybody else the same."Uncle David is not handsome, but good."Uncle Jimmie is not handsome, but his hair curls."Uncle Peter is the most handsome man that ere the sun shown on.He has beautiful teeth, and I like him."Yesterday the Wordsworth Club--that's what Uncle Jimmie calls us
because he says we are seven--went to the Art Museum to edjucate me in
art."Aunt Beulah wanted to take me to one room and keep me there until I
asked to come out.Uncle Jimmie wanted to show me the statures.Uncle
David said I ought to begin with the Ming period and work down to Art
Newvoo.Aunts Gertrude and Margaret wanted to take me to the room of
the great masters.While they were talking Uncle Peter and I went to
see a picture that made me cry.He said that
wasn't the important thing, that the important thing was that one man
had nailed his dream.He didn't doubt that lots of other painters had,
but this one meant the most to him.When I cried he said, 'You're all
right, Baby.*       *       *       *       *

As the month progressed, it seemed to Beulah that she was making
distinct progress with the child.Since the evening when Peter had won
Eleanor's confidence and explained her mental processes, her task had
been illumined for her.She belonged to that class of women in whom
maternity arouses late.She had not the facile sympathy which accepts
a relationship without the endorsement of the understanding, and she
was too young to have much toleration for that which was not perfectly
clear to her.She had started in with high courage to demonstrate the value of a
sociological experiment.She hoped later, though these hopes she had
so far kept to herself, to write, or at least to collaborate with some
worthy educator, on a book which would serve as an exact guide to
other philanthropically inclined groups who might wish to follow the
example of cooperative adoption; but the first day of actual contact
with her problem had chilled her.She had put nothing down in her
note-book.There seemed to be no
intellectual response in the child.Peter had set all these things right for her.He had shown her the
child's uncompromising integrity of spirit.The keynote of Beulah's
nature was, as Jimmie said, that she "had to be shown."Peter pointed
out the fact to her that Eleanor's slogan also was, "No compromise."As Eleanor became more familiar with her surroundings this spirit
became more and more evident."I could let down the hem of these dresses, Aunt Beulah," she said one
day, looking down at the long stretch of leg protruding from the chic
blue frock that made her look like a Boutet de Monvil."I can't hem
very good, but my stitches don't show much.""That dress isn't too short, dear.It's the way little girls always
wear them.Do little girls on Cape Cod wear them longer?""Albertina," they had reached the point of discussion of Albertina
now, and Beulah was proud of it, "wore her dresses to her ankles,
be--because her--her legs was so fat.She said that mine was--were
getting to be fat too, and it wasn't refined to wear short dresses,
when your legs were fat.""There are a good many conflicting ideas of refinement in the world,
Eleanor," Beulah said."I've noticed there are, since I came to New York," Eleanor answered
unexpectedly.Beulah's academic spirit recognized and rejoiced in the fact that with
all her docility, Eleanor held firmly to her preconceived notions.She
continued to wear her dresses short, but when she was not actually on
exhibition, she hid her long legs behind every available bit of
furniture or drapery.The one doubt left in her mind, of the child's initiative and
executive ability, was destined to be dissipated by the rather heroic
measures sometimes resorted to by a superior agency taking an ironic
hand in the game of which we have been too inhumanly sure.On the fifth week of Eleanor's stay Beulah became a real aunt, the
cook left, and her own aunt and official chaperon, little Miss
Prentis, was laid low with an attack of inflammatory rheumatism.Beulah's excitement on these various counts, combined with
indiscretions in the matter of overshoes and overfatigue, made her an
easy victim to a wandering grip germ.She opened her eyes one morning
only to shut them with a groan of pain.There was an ache in her head
and a thickening in her chest, the significance of which she knew only
too well.She lifted a hoarse voice
and called for Mary, the maid, who did not sleep in the house but was
due every morning at seven.But the gentle knock on the door was
followed by the entrance of Eleanor, not Mary."Mary didn't come, Aunt Beulah.I thought you was--were so tired, I'd
let you have your sleep out.I heard Miss Prentis calling, and I made
her some gruel, and I got my own breakfast."how dreadful," Beulah gasped in the face of this new calamity;
"and I'm really so sick.Then she put a professional hand on her
pulse and her forehead."You've got the grip," she announced."I'm afraid I have, Eleanor, and Doctor Martin's out of town, and
won't be back till to-morrow when he comes to Aunt Ann.I don't know
what we'll do.""I'll tend to things," Eleanor said."You lie still and close your
eyes, and don't put your arms out of bed and get chilled.""Well, you'll have to manage somehow," Beulah moaned; "how, I don't
know, I'm sure.Give Aunt Annie her medicine and hot water bags, and
just let me be.After the door had closed on the child a dozen things occurred to
Beulah that might have been done for her.She thought of the soothing warmth
of antiphlogistine when applied to the chest.She thought of the
quinine on the shelf in the bathroom.Once more she tried lifting her
head, but she could not accomplish a sitting posture.She shivered as
a draft from the open window struck her."If I could only be taken in hand this morning," she thought, "I know
it could be broken."Eleanor, in the cook's serviceable apron of
gingham that would have easily contained another child the same size,
swung the door open with one hand and held it to accommodate the
passage of the big kitchen tray, deeply laden with a heterogeneous
collection of objects.She pulled two chairs close to the bedside and
deposited her burden upon them.Then she removed from the tray a
goblet of some steaming fluid and offered it to Beulah."It's cream of wheat gruel," she said, and added ingratiatingly: "It
tastes nice in a tumbler."Beulah drank the hot decoction gratefully and found, to her surprise,
that it was deliciously made.Eleanor took the glass away from her and placed it on the tray, from
which she took what looked to Beulah like a cloth covered omelet,--at
any rate, it was a crescent shaped article slightly yellow in tone."It's just about right," she said.Then she fixed Beulah with a stern
eye."Open your chest," she commanded, "and show me the spot where
it's worst.Beulah hesitated only a second, then she obeyed meekly.She had never
seen a meal poultice before, but the heat on her afflicted chest was
grateful to her.Antiphlogistine was only Denver mud anyhow.Meekly,
also, she took the six grains of quinine and the weak dose of jamaica
ginger and water that she was next offered.She felt encouraged and
refreshed enough by this treatment to display some slight curiosity
when the little girl produced a card of villainous looking
safety-pins."I'm going to pin you in with these, Aunt Beulah," she said, "and then
sweat your cold out of you.""Indeed, you're not," Beulah said; "don't be absurd, Eleanor.The
theory of the grip is--," but she was addressing merely the vanishing
hem of cook's voluminous apron.The child returned almost instantly with three objects of assorted
sizes that Beulah could not identify.From the outside they looked
like red flannel and from the way Eleanor handled them it was evident
that they also were hot."I het--heated the flatirons," Eleanor explained, "the way I do for
Grandma, and I'm going to spread 'em around you, after you're pinned
in the blankets, and you got to lie there till you prespire, and
prespire good.""I won't do it," Beulah moaned, "I won't do any such thing."I cured Grandma and Grandpa and Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt that I worked
for, and I'm going to cure you," Eleanor said."Put your arms under those covers," she said, "or I'll dash a glass of
cold water in your face,"--and Beulah obeyed her.Peter nodded wisely when Beulah, cured by these summary though
obsolete methods, told the story in full detail.Gertrude had laughed
until the invalid had enveloped herself in the last few shreds of her
dignity and ordered her out of the room, and the others had been
scarcely more sympathetic."I know that it's funny, Peter," she said, "but you see, I can't help
worrying about it just the same.Of course, as soon as I was up she
was just as respectful and obedient to my slightest wish as she ever
was, but at the time, when she was lording it over me so, she--she
actually slapped me.You never saw such a--blazingly determined little
creature."Peter smiled,--gently, as was Peter's way when any friend of his made
an appeal to him."That's all right, Beulah," he said, "don't you let it disturb you for
an instant.This manifestation had nothing to do with our experiment.Our experiment is working fine--better than I dreamed it would ever
work.What happened to Eleanor, you know, was simply this.Some of the
conditions of her experience were recreated suddenly, and she
reverted."CHAPTER VI

JIMMIE BECOMES A PARENT


The entrance into the dining-room of the curly headed young man and
his pretty little niece, who had a suite on the eighth floor, as the
room clerk informed all inquirers, was always a matter of interest to
the residents of the Hotel Winchester.They were an extremely
picturesque pair to the eye seeking for romance and color.The child
had the pure, clear cut features of the cameo type of New England
maidenhood.She was always dressed in some striking combination of
blue, deep blue like her eyes, with blue hair ribbons.Her
good-looking young relative, with hair almost as near the color of the
sun as her own, seemed to be entirely devoted to her, which,
considering the charm of the child and the radiant and magnetic spirit
of the young man himself, was a delightfully natural manifestation.But one morning near the close of the second week of their stay, the
usual radiation of resilient youth was conspicuously absent from the
young man's demeanor, and the child's face reflected the gloom that
sat so incongruously on the contour of an optimist.The little girl
fumbled her menu card, but the waitress--the usual aging pedagogic
type of the small residential hotel--stood unnoticed at the young
man's elbow for some minutes before he was sufficiently aroused from
his gloomy meditations to address her.When he turned to her at last,
however, it was with the grin that she had grown to associate with
him,--the grin, the absence of which had kept her waiting behind his
chair with a patience that she was, except in a case where her
affections were involved, entirely incapable of.Jimmie's
protestations of inability to make headway with the ladies were not
entirely sincere."Bring me everything on the menu," he said, with a wave of his hand in
the direction of that painstaking pasteboard."Coffee, tea, fruit,
marmalade, breakfast food, ham and eggs.With another wave of the hand he dismissed her."You can't eat it all, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor protested."I'll make a bet with you," Jimmie declared."I'll bet you a dollar
to a doughnut that if she brings it all, I'll eat it."Uncle Jimmie, you know she won't bring it.You never bet so I can
get the dollar,--you never do.""I never bet so I can get my doughnut, if it comes to that.""I don't know where to buy any doughnuts," Eleanor said; "besides,
Uncle Jimmie, I don't really consider that I owe them.I never really
say that I'm betting, and you tell me I've lost before I've made up my
mind anything about it.""Speaking of doughnuts," Jimmie said, his face still wearing the look
of dejection under a grin worn awry, "can you cook, Eleanor?Can you
roast a steak, and saute baked beans, and stew sausages, and fry out a
breakfast muffin?he suddenly
demanded of the waitress, who was serving him, with an apologetic eye
on the menu, the invariable toast-coffee-and-three-minute-egg
breakfast that he had eaten every morning since his arrival."She looks like a capable one," she
pronounced."I _can_ cook, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor giggled, "but not the way you
said.You don't roast steak, or--or--"

"Don't you?"Jimmie asked with the expression of pained surprise that
never failed to make his ward wriggle with delight.There were links
in the educational scheme that Jimmie forged better than any of the
cooperative guardians.Not even Jimmie realized the value of the
giggle as a developing factor in Eleanor's existence.He took three
swallows of coffee and frowned into his cup."I can make coffee," he
added.Well, we may as well look the facts in the face,
Eleanor.We're moving away from this elegant hostelry
to-morrow."Apologies to Aunt Beulah (mustn't call you Kiddo) and the
reason is, that I'm broke.I haven't got any money at all, Eleanor,
and I don't know where I am going to get any."But you go to work every morning, Uncle Jimmie?"I go looking for work, but so far no nice
juicy job has come rolling down into my lap.I haven't told you this
before because,--well--when Aunt Beulah comes down every day to give
you your lessons I wanted it to look all O. K. I thought if you didn't
know, you couldn't forget sometime and tell her.""I don't tattle tale," Eleanor said.It's only my doggone pride that makes me
want to keep up the bluff, but you're a game kid,--you--know.I tried
to get you switched off to one of the others till I could get on my
feet, but--no, they just thought I had stage fright.It would be pretty humiliating to me to admit that I couldn't
support one-sixth of a child that I'd given my solemn oath to
be-parent.""Be-parent, if it isn't a word, I invent it.It's awfully tough luck
for you, and if you want me to I'll own up to the crowd that I can't
swing you, but if you are willing to stick, why, we'll fix up some
kind of a way to cut down expenses and bluff it out."Jimmie watched her apparent
hesitation with some dismay."Say the word," he declared, "and I'll tell 'em."I don't want you to tell 'em," Eleanor cried.If you could get me a place, you know, I could go out to
work.You don't eat very much for a man, and I might get my meals
thrown in--"

"Don't, Eleanor, don't," Jimmie agonized."I've got a scheme for us
all right.The day will
come when I can provide you with Pol Roge and diamonds.My father is
rich, you know, but he swore to me that I couldn't support myself, and
I swore to him that I could, and if I don't do it, I'm damned.I am
really, and that isn't swearing.""I know it isn't, when you mean it the way they say in the Bible.""I don't want the crowd to know.I don't want Gertrude to know.She
hasn't got much idea of me anyway.I'll get another job, if I can only
hold out.""I can go to work in a store," Eleanor cried."I can be one of those
little girls in black dresses that runs between counters.""Do you want to break your poor Uncle James' heart, Eleanor,--do
you?"I've borrowed a studio, a large barnlike studio on
Washington Square, suitably equipped with pots and pans and kettles.Also, I am going to borrow the wherewithal to keep us going.It isn't
a bad kind of place if anybody likes it.There's one dinky little
bedroom for you and a cot bed for me, choked in bagdad.If you could
kind of engineer the cooking end of it, with me to do the dirty work,
of course, I think we could be quite snug and cozy.""I know we could, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor said."Will Uncle Peter come
to see us just the same?"It thus befell that on the fourteenth day of the third month of her
residence in New York, Eleanor descended into Bohemia.Having no least
suspicion of the real state of affairs--for Jimmie, like most
apparently expansive people who are given to rattling nonsense, was
actually very reticent about his own business--the other members of
the sextette did not hesitate to show their chagrin and disapproval at
the change in his manner of living."The Winchester was an ideal place for Eleanor," Beulah wailed."It's
deadly respectable and middle class, but it was just the kind of
atmosphere for her to accustom herself to.She was learning to manage
herself so prettily.This morning when I went to the studio--I wanted
to get the lessons over early, and take Eleanor to see that exhibition
of Bavarian dolls at Kuhner's--I found her washing up a trail of
dishes in that closet behind the screen--you've seen it,
Gertrude?--like some poor little scullery maid.She said that Jimmie
had made an omelet for breakfast.If he'd made fifty omelets there
couldn't have been a greater assortment of dirty dishes and kettles.""Jimmie made an omelet for me once for which he used two dozen eggs.He kept breaking them until he found the yolks of a color to suit him.He said pale yolks made poor omelets, so he threw all the pale ones
away.""I suppose that you sat by and let him," Beulah said."You would let
Jimmie do anything.You're as bad as Margaret is about David.""Or as bad as you are about Peter.""There we go, just like any silly, brainless girls, whose chief object
in life is the--the other sex," Beulah cried inconsistently."So do I--in theory--" Gertrude answered, a little dreamily."Where do
Jimmie and Eleanor get the rest of their meals?""I can't seem to find out," Beulah said."I asked Eleanor point-blank
this morning what they had to eat last night and where they had it,
and she said, 'That's a secret, Aunt Beulah.'When I asked her why it
was a secret and who it was a secret with, she only looked worried,
and said she guessed she wouldn't talk about it at all because that
was the only way to be safe about tattling.You know what I think--I
think Jimmie is taking her around to the cafes and all the shady
extravagant restaurants.He thinks it's sport and it keeps him from
getting bored with the child.""Well, that's one way of educating the young," Gertrude said, "but I
think you are wrong, Beulah."CHAPTER VII

ONE DESCENT INTO BOHEMIA


"Aunt Beulah does not think that Uncle Jimmie is bringing me up
right," Eleanor confided to the pages of her diary."She comes down
here and is very uncomforterble.Well he is bringing me up good, in
some ways better than she did.When he swears he always puts out his
hand for me to slap him.He can't get any
work or earn wages.The advertisement business is on the bum this year
becase times are so hard up.The advertisers have to save their money
and advertising agents are failing right and left.So poor Uncle
Jimmie can't get a place to work at."The people in the other studios are very neighborly.Uncle Jimmie
leaves a sine on the door when he goes out.They don't they come right in and borrow things.Uncle Jimmie says not
to have much to do with them, becase they are so queer, but when I am
not at home, the ladies come to call on him, and drink Moxie or
something.Uncle Jimmie says I shall
not have Behemiar thrust upon me by him, and to keep away from these
ladies until I grow up and then see if I like them.Aunt Beulah thinks
that Uncle Jimmie takes me around to other studios and I won't tell
but he does not take me anywhere except to walk and have ice-cream
soda, but I say I don't want it because of saving the ten cents.We
cook on an old gas stove that smells.I can't do very good
housekeeping becase things are not convenient.I haven't any oven to
do a Saturday baking in, and Uncle Jimmie won't let me do the washing.I should feel more as if I earned my keap if I baked beans and made
boiled dinners and layer cake, but in New York they don't eat much but
hearty food and saluds.It isn't stylish to have cake and pie and
pudding all at one meal.He eats pie for
his breakfast, but if I told anybody they would laugh.If I wrote
Albertina what folks eat in New York she would laugh."Uncle Jimmie is teaching me to like salud.He laughs when I cut up
lettice and put sugar on it.He teaches me to like olives and dried
up sausages and sour crought.He says it is important to be edjucated
in eating, and everytime we go to the Delicate Essenn store to buy
something that will edjucate me better.He teaches me to say 'I beg
your pardon,' and 'Polly vous Fransay?'and to courtesy and how to
enter a room the way you do in private theatricals.He says it isn't
knowing these things so much as knowing when you do them that counts,
and then Aunt Beulah complains that I am not being brought up."I have not seen Uncle Peter for a weak.I would not have to tell him how I was being brought up, and
whether I was hitting the white lights as Uncle Jimmie says.--He would
know."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor did not write Albertina during the time when she was living in
the studio.Some curious inversion of pride kept her silent on the
subject of the change in her life.Albertina would have turned up her
nose at the studio, Eleanor knew.Therefore, she would not so much as
address an envelope to that young lady from an interior which she
would have beheld with scorn.She held long conversations with
Gwendolyn, taking the part of Albertina, on the subject of this
snobbishness of attitude.*       *       *       *       *

"Lots of people in New York have to live in little teny, weeny rooms,
Albertina," she would say.This
studio is so big I get tired dusting all the way round it, and even if
it isn't furnished very much, why, think how much furnishing would
cost, and carpets and gold frames for the pictures!The pictures that
are in here already, without any frames, would sell for hundreds of
dollars apiece if the painter could get anybody to buy them.You ought
to be very thankful for such a place, Albertina, instead of feeling so
stuck up that you pick up your skirts from it."*       *       *       *       *

But Albertina's superiority of mind was impregnable.Her spirit sat in
judgment on all the conditions of Eleanor's new environment.She hated the nicked, dun 
dishes they ate from, and the black bottomed pots and pans that all
the energy of Eleanor's energetic little elbow could not restore to
decency again.She hated the cracked, dun  walls, and the
mottled floor that no amount of sweeping and dusting seemed to make an
impression on.She hated the compromise of housekeeping in an
attic,--she who had been bred in an atmosphere of shining
nickle-plated ranges and linoleum, where even the kitchen pump gleamed
brightly under its annual coat of good green paint.She hated the
compromise, that was the burden of her complaint--either in the person
of Albertina or Gwendolyn, whether she lay in the crook of Eleanor's
arm in the lumpy bed where she reposed at the end of the day's labor,
or whether she sat bolt upright on the lumpy cot in the studio, the
broken bisque arm, which Jimmie insisted on her wearing in a sling
whenever he was present, dangling limply at her side in the relaxation
Eleanor preferred for it.The fact of not having adequate opportunity to keep her house in order
troubled the child, for her days were zealously planned by her
enthusiastic guardians.Beulah came at ten o'clock every morning to
give her lessons.As Jimmie's quest for work grew into a more and more
disheartening adventure, she had difficulty in getting him out of bed
in time to prepare and clear away the breakfast for Beulah's arrival.After lunch, to which Jimmie scrupulously came home, she was supposed
to work an hour at her modeling clay.Gertrude, who was doing very
promising work at the art league, came to the studio twice a week to
give her instruction in handling it.Later in the afternoon one of the
aunts or uncles usually appeared with some scheme to divert her.Margaret was telling her the stories of the Shakespeare plays, and
David was trying to make a card player of her, but was not succeeding
as well as if Albertina had not been brought up a hard shell Baptist,
who thought card playing a device of the devil's.Peter alone did not
come, for even when he was in town he was busy in the afternoon.As soon as her guests were gone, Eleanor hurried through such
housewifely tasks as were possible of accomplishment at that hour, but
the strain was telling on her.Jimmie began to realize this and it
added to his own distress.One night to save her the labor of
preparing the meal, he took her to an Italian restaurant in the
neighborhood where the food was honest and palatable, and the service
at least deft and clean.Eleanor enjoyed the experience extremely, until an incident occurred
which robbed her evening of its sweetness and plunged her into the
purgatory of the child who has inadvertently broken one of its own
laws.Among the belongings in the carpetbag, which was no more--having been
supplanted by a smart little suit-case marked with her initials--was a
certificate from the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society, duly
signed by herself, and witnessed by the grammar-school teacher and the
secretary of the organization.On this certificate (which was
decorated by many presentations in dim black and white of
mid-Victorian domestic life, and surmounted by a collection of
scalloped clouds in which drifted three amateur looking angels amid a
crowd of more professional cherubim) Eleanor had pledged herself to
abstain from the use as a beverage of all intoxicating drinks, and
from the manufacture or traffic in them.She had also subscribed
herself as willing to make direct and persevering efforts to extend
the principles and blessings of total abstinence."Red ink, Andrea," her Uncle Jimmie had demanded, as the black-eyed
waiter bent over him, "and ginger ale for the offspring."It was fun to be with Uncle Jimmie in a restaurant again.He
always called for something new and unexpected when he spoke of her to
the waiter, and he was always what Albertina would consider "very
comical" when he talked to him."But stay," he added holding up an
admonitory finger, "I think we'll give the little one _eau rougie_
this time.Wouldn't you like _eau rougie_, tinted water, Eleanor, the
way the French children drink it?"Unsuspectingly she sipped the mixture of water and ice and sugar, and
"red ink" from the big brown glass bottle that the glowing waiter set
before them.As the meal progressed Jimmie told her that the grated cheese was
sawdust and almost made her believe it.He showed her how to eat
spaghetti without cutting it and pointed out to her various Italian
examples of his object lesson; but she soon realized that in spite of
his efforts to entertain her, he was really very unhappy."I've borrowed all the money I can, Angelface," he confessed finally.If I don't land that job at the
Perkins agency I'll have to give in and tell Peter and David, or wire
Dad.""You could get some other kind of a job," Eleanor said; "plumbing or
clerking or something."On Cape Cod the plumber and the grocer's clerk
lost no caste because of their calling."I _could_ so demean myself, and I will.I'll be a chauffeur, I can
run a car all right; but the fact remains that by to-morrow
something's got to happen, or I've got to own up to the bunch."She tried hard to think of something to comfort
him but she could not.Jimmie mixed her more _eau rougie_ and she
drank it.He poured a full glass, undiluted, for himself, and held it
up to the light."Well, here's to crime, daughter," he said."Long may it wave, and us
with it.""That isn't really red ink, is it?""It's an awfully pretty
color--like grape juice.""It is grape juice, my child, if we don't inquire too closely into the
matter.The Italians are like the French in the guide book, 'fond of
dancing and light wines.'This is one of the light wines they are fond
of.--Hello, do you feel sick, child?As soon as I can get hold of that sacrificed waiter we'll get
out of here."Eleanor's sickness was of the spirit, but at the moment she was
incapable of telling him so, incapable of any sort of speech.A great
wave of faintness encompassed her.She had
lightly encouraged a departure from the blessings and principles of
total abstinence.That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned apology to her
Maker for the sin of intemperance into which she had been so
unwittingly betrayed.She promised Him that she would never drink
anything that came out of a bottle again.She reviewed sorrowfully her
many arguments with Albertina--Albertina in the flesh that is--on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided that again that
virtuous child was right in her condemnation of any drink, however
harmless in appearance or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of a
bottled label.She knew, however, that something more than a prayer for forgiveness
was required of her.She was pledged to protest against the evil that
she had seemingly countenanced.She could not seek the sleep of the
innocent until that reparation was made.Through the crack of her
sagging door she saw the light from Jimmie's reading lamp and knew
that he was still dressed, or clothed at least, with a sufficient
regard for the conventionalities to permit her intrusion.She rose and
rebraided her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it.Then she put on
her stockings and her blue Japanese kimono--real Japanese, as Aunt
Beulah explained, made for a Japanese lady of quality--and made her
way into the studio.Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable studio chair with his
book under the light and his feet on the bamboo tea table as usual.He was flung on the couch with his face
buried in the cushions, and his shoulders were shaking.Eleanor seeing
him thus, forgot her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence, forgot
everything but the pitiful spectacle of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in
grief.She stood looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort."Uncle Jimmie," she said, "Uncle Jimmie."At the sound of her voice he put out his hand to her, gropingly, but
he did not uncover his face or shift his position.She found herself
smoothing his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and more
conviction as he snuggled his boyish head closer."I'm awfully discouraged," he said in a weak muffled voice."I'm sorry
you caught me at it, Baby."Eleanor put her face down close to his as he turned it to her."Everything will be all right," she promised him, "everything will be
all right.You'll soon get a job--tomorrow maybe."Then she gathered him close in her angular, tense little arms and held
him there tightly."Everything will be all right," she repeated
soothingly; "now you just put your head here, and have your cry out."CHAPTER VIII

THE TEN HUTCHINSONS


"My Aunt Margaret has a great many people living in her family,"
Eleanor wrote to Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights."She has a mother and a father, and two (2) grandparents, one
(1) aunt, one (1) brother, one (1) married lady and the boy of the
lady, I think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask any one,
oh--and another brother, who does not live here only on Saturdays and
Sundays.Aunt Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait on the
table.I guess you have read about them in
stories.I am taken right in to be one of the family, and I have a
good time every day now.Aunt Margaret's father is a college teacher,
and Aunt Margaret's grandfather looks like the father of his country.They have a piano here that
plays itself like a sewing machine.They have
after-dinner coffee and gold spoons to it.I guess you would like to
see a gold spoon.They are about the size of the tin spoons we
had in our playhouse.I have a lot of fun with that boy too.At first
I thought he was very affected, but that is just the way they teach
him to talk.He is nine and plays tricks on other people.He dares me
to do things that I don't do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar.If
Aunt Margaret's mother was my grandma I might steal sugar or plum
cake.Remember the time we took your mother's hermits?You would think this house was quite a
grand house.It has three (3) flights of stairs and one basement.I
sleep on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt Margaret's only
it isn't a dressing room.Aunt
Margaret is pretty and sings lovely.*       *       *       *       *

In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate facts of her new
existence, such facts as she instinctively guarded from Albertina's
calculating sense.*       *       *       *       *

"Everybody makes fun of me here.I don't care if they do, but I can't
eat so much at the table when every one is laughing at me.They get
me to talking and then they laugh.If I could see anything to laugh
at, I would laugh too.They laugh in a refined way but they laugh.They say to
my face that I am like a merry wilkins story and too good to be true,
and New England projuces lots of real art, and I am art, I can't
remember all the things, but I guess they mean well.Aunt Margaret's
grandfather sits at the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before.He knows the govoner and does not like the way
he parts his hair.I thought all govoners did what they wanted to with
their hairs or anything and people had to like it because (I used to
spell because wrong but I spell better now) they was the govoners, but
it seems not at all.I meant to like
Aunt Beulah the best because she has done the most for me but I am
afrayd I don't.I would not cross my heart and say so.Aunt Margaret
gives me the lessons now.I guess I learn most as much as I learned I
mean was taught of Aunt Beulah.Oh dear sometimes I get descouraged
on account of its being such a funny world and so many diferent people
in it.I was afrayd of the hired
butler, but I am not now."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor had not made a direct change from the Washington Square studio
to the ample house of the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that
a change in Jimmie's fortunes had taken her back to the Winchester and
enabled her to accustom herself again to the amenities of gentler
living.Like all sensitive and impressionable children she took on the
color of a new environment very quickly.The strain of her studio
experience had left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but she
had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful surroundings of
the Winchester and under the influence of Jimmie's restored spirits.The change had come about on Jimmie's "last day of grace."He had
secured the coveted position at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.He had left Eleanor
in the morning determined to face becomingly the disappointment that
was in store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of admitting
his failure to his friends.He had come back in the late afternoon
with his fortunes restored, the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and inspired footing.He had burst into the studio with his news before he understood that
Eleanor was not alone, and inadvertently shared the secret with
Gertrude, who had been waiting for him with the kettle alight and some
wonderful cakes from "Henri's" spread out on the tea table.The three
had celebrated by dining together at a festive down-town hotel and
going back to his studio for coffee.At parting they had solemnly and
severally kissed one another.Eleanor lay awake in the dark for a long
time that night softly rubbing the cheek that had been so caressed,
and rejoicing that the drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and
had pledged their health with so assiduously, had come out of two
glasses instead of a bottle.Her life at the Hutchinsons' was almost like a life on another planet.Margaret was the younger, somewhat delicate daughter of a family of
rather strident academics.Professor Hutchinson was not dependent on
his salary to defray the expenses of his elegant establishment, but
on his father, who had inherited from his father in turn the
substantial fortune on which the family was founded.Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but she was considerably
more fortunate in her choice of a foster family than is usually the
fate of the foundling.The rigorous altitude of intellect in which she
was reared served as a corrective to the oversensitive quality of her
imagination.Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of her life was given to
visitations from the poetic muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines
to her on one of the pink pages of the private diary.They ran as
follows, and even Professor Hutchinson, who occupied the chair of
English in that urban community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated Eleanor's
description of his daughter as one that did not describe."Aunt Margaret is fair and kind,
                  And very good and tender."She moves around the room with grace,
                  Her hands she puts with quickness.Although she wears upon her face
                  The shadow of a sickness."It was this "shadow of a sickness," that served to segregate Margaret
to the extent that was really necessary for her well being.To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities of the family
might have forever dulled that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came
to owe so much in the various stages of her development.Margaret put her arm about the child after the ordeal of the first
dinner at the big table."Father does not bite," she said, "but Grandfather does.If Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your
life.""I don't know where to run to," Eleanor answered seriously, whereupon
Margaret hugged her.Her Aunt Margaret would have been puzzling to
Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication, but for the quick imagination
that unwound her riddles almost as she presented them.For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh Hutchinson senior did
bite, he looked so much like some of the worst of the pictures in
Little Red Riding Hood."While you are here I'm going to pretend you're my very own child,"
Margaret told Eleanor that first evening, "and we'll never, never tell
anybody all the foolish games we play and the things we say to each
other.I can just barely manage to be grown up in the bosom of my
family, and when I am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah, but
up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown up.She opened a funny old chest in the
corner of the spacious, high studded chamber."And here are some of
the dolls that I play with."She produced a manikin dressed primly
after the manner of eighteen-thirty, prim parted hair over a small
head festooned with ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her
fingers."Beulah," she said with a mischievous flash of a grimace at
Eleanor."Gertrude,"--a dashing young brunette in riding clothes."Jimmie,"--a curly haired dandy."David,"--a serious creature with a
monocle."I couldn't find Peter," she said, "but we'll make him some
day out of cotton and water colors."Eleanor cried in delight, "real dolls with
hair and different  eyes?""I can make pretty good ones," Margaret smiled; "manikins like
these,--a Frenchwoman taught me."And do you play that the dolls talk to each other as if
they was--were the persons?"Margaret assembled the four manikins into a smart little
group.The doll Beulah rose,--on her forefinger."I can't help
feeling," mimicked Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah's
earnest contralto, "that we're wasting our lives,--criminally
dissipating our forces."The doll Gertrude put up both hands."I want to laugh," she cried,
"won't everybody please stop talking till I've had my laugh out."Why, that's just like Aunt Gertrude," Eleanor said."Her voice has
that kind of a sound like a bell, only more ripply.""Don't be high-brow," Jimmie's lazy baritone besought with the slight
burring of the "r's" that Eleanor found so irresistible."I'm only a
poor hard-working, business man.""We intend to devote the
rest of our lives," he said, "to the care of our beloved cooperative
orphan."On that he made a rather over mannered exit, Margaret
planting each foot down deliberately until she flung him back in his
box."That's the kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is," she
continued, "but you mustn't ever tell anybody, Eleanor."She clasped
the child again in one of her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor
squeezing her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with her new
existence."But there isn't any doll for _you_, Aunt Margaret," she cried.yes, there is, but I wasn't going to show her to you unless you
asked, because she's so nice.I saved the prettiest one of all to be
myself, not because I believe I'm so beautiful, but--but only because
I'd like to be, Eleanor.""I always pretend I'm a princess," Eleanor admitted.The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful creation, a little more
like Marie Antoinette than her namesake, but bearing a not
inconsiderable resemblance to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night after this.In the
daytime she looked rather battered and ugly to eyes accustomed to the
delicate finish of creatures like the French manikins, but after she
was tucked away in her cot in the passion flower dressing-room--all of
Margaret's belongings and decorations were a faint, pinky
lavender,--her dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated Albertina at
increasingly rare intervals as time advanced, lay in the hollow of her
arm and received her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.*       *       *       *       *

"When my two (2) months are up here I think I should be quite sorry,"
she wrote in the diary, "except that I'm going to Uncle Peter next,
and him I would lay me down and dee for, only I never get time enough
to see him, and know if he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know.Well life is very exciting all the time now.Aunt Margaret
brings me up this way.She tells me that she loves me and that I've
got beautiful eyes and hair and am sweet.She says she wants to love me up enough to last because I never
had love enough before.Albertina never loves any
one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody--not to say so anyway.If a
man is getting married they say he _likes_ that girl he is going to
marry.In New York they act as different as they eat.The Hutchinsons
act different from anybody.They do not know Aunt Margaret has adoptid
me.Nobody knows I am adoptid but me and my aunts and uncles.Miss
Prentis and Aunt Beulah's mother when she came home and all the
bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons think I am a little
visiting girl from the country.It is nobody's business because I am
supported out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me feel queer
sometimes.I feel like

                "'Where did you come from, baby dear,
                Out of the nowhere unto the here?'Also I made this up out of home sweet home."'Pleasures and palaces where e'er I may roam,
            Be it ever so humble I wish I had a home.'"I like having six homes, but I wish everybody knew it.Speaking of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my aunts
and uncles did not marry each other and make it easier for every one.She said they were not going to get married.'Am I the same thing as getting married?'She said no, I
wasn't except that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish and
real.Aunt Beulah doesn't believe in marriage.Aunt Margaret doesn't think she has the health.Aunt Gertrude has
to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has got to marry some one
his mother says to or not at all, and does not like to marry anyway.Uncle Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks you have a beter
time in single blesedness.Uncle Peter did not sign in the book where
they said they would adopt me and not marry.They did not want to ask
him because he had some trouble once.Well I am
going to be married sometime.I want a house to do the housework in
and a husband and a backyard full of babies.Perhaps I would rather
have a hired butler and gold spoons.Of course I
would like to have time to write poetry.I can sculpture too, but I
don't want a career of it because it's so dirty."*       *       *       *       *

Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during this phase of her
existence.The nourishing food and regular living, the sympathy
established between herself and Margaret, the regime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been obliged guiltily to
disregard during the strenuous days of her existence in Washington
Square, all contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being.She played with Margaret's nephew, and ran up and down
stairs on errands for her mother.She listened to the tales related
for her benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the attentions
of the two formidable young men of the family, who entertained her
with the pianola and excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.*       *       *       *       *

"The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday afternoon," she wrote--on a
yellow page this time--"usually at Aunt Beulah's house.I am examined on what I have learned but I don't mind
it much.Physically I am found to be very good by measure and waite.I am very bright on the subject of
poetry.They do not know whether David Copperfield had been a wise
choice for me, but when I told them the story and talked about it they
said I had took it right.I don't tell them about the love part of
Aunt Margaret's bringing up.Aunt Beulah says it would make me self
conscioush to know that I had such pretty eyes and hair.Aunt Gertrude
said 'why not mention my teeth to me, then,' but no one seemed to
think so.Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because the
theory is to strengthen the weak part of the bridge, and make me do
arithmetic.'Drill on the deficiency,' she says.Well I should think
the love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks love is weak
and beneath her and any one.Uncle David told me privately that he
thought I was having the best that could happen to me right now being
with Aunt Margaret.I didn't tell him that the David doll always gets
put away in the box with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have.*       *       *       *       *

Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful scene in which she
had participated.*       *       *       *       *

"I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons.They laughed
at me too much for being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at Aunt Margaret for
adopting me and the tears came in her eyes I could not bare it.I did
not let the cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out.The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to Cape Cod, and I said I
hoped never, and then I said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next.They said 'Uncle David--do you mean
David Bolling?'and I did, so I said 'yes.'Then all the Hutchinsons
pitched into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying, 'Who is this
mysterious child anyway, and how is it that her guardians intrust her
to a crowd of scatter brain youngsters for so long?'and then they
said 'Uncle David Bolling--_what_ does his mother say?'Then Aunt
Margaret got very red in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said 'I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle David is as much my
Uncle David as they all are,' and then I said 'My Aunt Margaret has
got a perfect right to have me intrusted to her at any time, and not
to be laughed at for it,' and I went and stood in front of her and
gave her my handkercheve."Well I am glad somebody has been told that I am properly adoptid, but
I am sorry it is the ten Hutchinsons who know."CHAPTER IX

PETER


Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown up; that was the
wonderful thing about her visit to him,--if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another.From the moment when he ushered
her into his friendly, low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon
tiers of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of equality to the
miraculous order of existence that it was the privilege of her life to
share.The pink silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah's; the implacable British stuffiness at the
Winchester which had had its own stolid charm for the lineal
descendant of the Pilgrim fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the "hired butler" presided distributing after-dinner gold
spoons, these impressions all dwindled and diminished and took their
insignificant place in the background of the romance she was living
and breathing in Peter's jewel box of an apartment on Thirtieth
Street.Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor's the place seemed to be
a realized ideal of charm and homeliness.It was one of the older
fashioned duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic decade for
a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently adapted to the modern
insistence on technical convenience.Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased it and settled it and
suddenly departed for a five years' residence in China with her
husband, who was as she so often described him, "a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker."Peter's domestic affairs were
despatched by a large, motherly Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of
on sight and later came to respect and adore without reservation.Peter's home was a home with a place in it for her--a place that it
was perfectly evident was better with her than without her.She even
slept in the bed that Peter's sister's little girl had occupied, and
there were pictures on the walls that had been selected for her.She had been very glad to make her escape from the Hutchinson
household.Her "quarrel" with them had made no difference in their
relation to her.To her surprise they treated her with an increase of
deference after her outburst, and every member of the family,
excepting possibly Hugh Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully
polite to her.Margaret explained that the family really didn't mind
having their daughter a party to the experiment of cooperative
parenthood.It appealed to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories of the independence
of the individual modified their criticism of Margaret's secrecy in
the matter, which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from the estate of the aunt
for whom she had been named."It is very silly of me to be sensitive about being laughed at,"
Margaret concluded."I've lived all my life surrounded by people
suffering from an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for things that are not
funny to me.""I shouldn't think you would," Eleanor answered devoutly.In Peter's house there was no one to laugh at her but Peter, and when
Peter laughed she considered it a triumph.It meant that there was
something she said that he liked.The welcome she had received as a
guest in his house and the wonderful evening that succeeded it were
among the epoch making hours in Eleanor's life.The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother Hutchinson still clung to the
old-time, stately method of getting about the streets of New York, had
left her at Peter's door at six o'clock of a keen, cool May evening.Margaret had not been well enough to come with her, having been
prostrated by one of the headaches of which she was a frequent
victim.The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved and paneled, with its
mammoth brass knocker, the row of window boxes along the cornice a few
feet above it, the very look of the house was an experience and an
adventure to her.When she rang, the door opened almost instantly
revealing Peter on the threshold with his arms open.He had led her up
two short flights of stairs--ivory white with carved banisters, she
noticed, all as immaculately shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod
interior--to his own gracious drawing-room where Mrs.Finnigan was
bowing and smiling a warmhearted Irish welcome to her.It was like a
wonderful story in a book and her eyes were shining with joy as Uncle
Peter pulled out her chair and she sat down to the first meal in her
honor.The grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave air with
which Peter consulted her tastes and her preferences were all a part
of a beautiful magic that had never quite touched her before.She had been like a little girl in a dream passing dutifully or
delightedly through the required phases of her experience, never quite
believing in its permanence or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own.That was what she felt the moment
she stepped over his threshold.After their coffee before the open fire--she herself had had "cambric"
coffee--Peter smoked his cigar, while she curled up in silence in the
twin to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.The blue
flames skimmed the bed of black coals, and finally settled steadily at
work on them nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was like a
basket full of molten light, glowing and golden as the hot sun when it
sinks into the sea.Except to offer her the ring about his slender Panatela, and to ask
her if she were happy, Peter did not speak until he had deliberately
crushed out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into the fire.The ceremony over, he held out his arms to her and she slipped into
them as if that moment were the one she had been waiting for ever
since the white morning looked into the window of the lavender
dressing-room on Morningside Heights, and found her awake and quite
cold with the excitement of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth."Eleanor," Peter said, when he was sure she was comfortably arranged
with her head on his shoulder, "Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn't any other home,
and you and I belonged to each other.I'm almost too young to be your
father, but--"

"Oh!Eleanor asked fervently, as he paused.

"--But I can come pretty near feeling like a father to you if it's a
father you want.I lost my own father when I was a little older than
you are now, but I had my dear mother and sister left, and so I don't
know what it's like to be all alone in the world, and I can't always
understand exactly how you feel, but you must always remember that I
want to understand and that I will understand if you tell me."Yes, Uncle Peter," she said soberly; then perhaps for the first time
since her babyhood she volunteered a caress that was not purely
maternal in its nature.She put up a shy hand to the cheek so close to
her own and patted it earnestly."Of course I've got my grandfather
and grandmother," she argued, "but they're very old, and not very
affectionate, either.Then I have all these new aunts and uncles
pretending," she was penetrating to the core of the matter, Peter
realized, "that they're just as good as parents.Of course, they're
just as good as they can be and they take so much trouble that it
mortifies me, but it isn't just the same thing, Uncle Peter!""I know," Peter said, "I know, dear, but you must remember we mean
well.""I don't mean you; it isn't you that I think of when I think about my
co--co-woperative parents, and it isn't any of them specially,--it's
just the idea of--of visiting around, and being laughed at, and not
really belonging to anybody.""That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle Peter," she whispered.They had a long talk after this, discussing the past and the future;
the past few months of the experiment from Eleanor's point of view,
and the future in relation to its failures and successes.Beulah was
to begin giving her lessons again and she was to take up music with a
visiting teacher on Peter's piano.(Eleanor had not known it was a
piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand before.Peter did
not know what a triumph it was when she made herself put the question
to him.)"If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much as she does and make it as
interesting as Aunt Margaret does, I think I would make her feel very
proud of me," Eleanor said."I get so nervous saving energy the way
Aunt Beulah says for me to that I forget all the lesson.Aunt Margaret
tells too many stories, I guess, but I like them.""Your Aunt Margaret is a child of God," Peter said devoutly, "in spite
of her raw-boned, intellectual family.""Uncle David says she's a daughter of the fairies."When Margaret's a year or two older you won't feel
the need of a mother.""I don't now," said Eleanor; "only a father,--that I want you to be,
the way you promised."Then he continued musingly, "You'll find
Gertrude--different.I can't quite imagine her presiding over your
moral welfare but I think she'll be good at it.She's a good deal of a
person, you know.""Aunt Beulah's a good kind of person, too," Eleanor said; "she tries
hard.The only thing is that she keeps trying to make me express
myself, and I don't know what that means.""Let me see if I can tell you," said Peter."Self-expression is a part
of every man's duty.Inside we are all trying to be good and true and
fine--"

"Except the villains," Eleanor interposed."People like Iago aren't
trying.""Well, we'll make an exception of the villains; we're talking of
people like us, pretty good people with the right instincts.Well
then, if all the time we're trying to be good and true and fine, we
carry about a blank face that reflects nothing of what we are feeling
and thinking, the world is a little worse off, a little duller and
heavier place for what is going on inside of us.""Well, how can we make it better off then?""By not thinking too much about it for one thing, except to remember
to smile, by trying to be just as much at home in it as possible, by
letting the kind of person we are trying to be show through on the
outside."By just not being bashful, do you mean?""Well, when Aunt Beulah makes me do those dancing exercises, standing
up in the middle of the floor and telling me to be a flower and
express myself as a flower, does she just mean not to be bashful?""Something like that: she means stop thinking of yourself and go
ahead--"

"But how can I go ahead with her sitting there watching?""I suppose I ought to tell you to imagine that you had the soul of a
flower, but I haven't the nerve.""You've got nerve enough to do anything," Eleanor assured him, but she
meant it admiringly, and seriously."I haven't the nerve to go on with a moral conversation in which you
are getting the better of me at every turn," Peter laughed."I'm sure
it's unintentional, but you make me feel like a good deal of an ass,
Eleanor.""That means a donkey, doesn't it?""It does, and by jove, I believe that you're glad of it.""I do rather like it," said Eleanor; "of course you don't really feel
like a donkey to me.I mean I don't make you feel like one, but it's
funny just pretending that you mean it.""Beulah tried to convey something of
the fact that you always got the better of every one in your modest
unassuming way, but I never quite believed it before.At any rate it's
bedtime, and here comes Mrs.Kiss me good
night, sweetheart."Eleanor flung her arms about his neck, in her first moment of
abandonment to actual emotional self-expression if Peter had only
known it."I will never really get the better of you in my life, Uncle Peter,"
she promised him passionately.CHAPTER X

THE OMNISCIENT FOCUS


One of the traditional prerogatives of an Omnipotent Power is to look
down at the activities of earth at any given moment and ascertain
simultaneously the occupation of any number of people.Thus the Arch
Creator--that Being of the Supreme Artistic Consciousness--is able to
peer into segregated interiors at His own discretion and watch the
plot thicken and the drama develop.Eleanor, who often visualized this
proceeding, always imagined a huge finger projecting into space,
cautiously tilting the roofs of the Houses of Man to allow the sweep
of the Invisible Glance.Granting the hypothesis of the Divine privilege, and assuming for the
purposes of this narrative the Omniscient focus on the characters most
concerned in it, let us for the time being look over the shoulder of
God and inform ourselves of their various occupations and
preoccupations of a Saturday afternoon in late June during the hour
before dinner.Eleanor, in her little white chamber on Thirtieth Street, was engaged
in making a pink and green toothbrush case for a going-away gift for
her Uncle Peter.To be sure she was going away with him when he
started for the Long Island beach hotel from which he proposed to
return every day to his office in the city, but she felt that a slight
token of her affection would be fitting and proper on the eve of their
joint departure.She was hurrying to get it done that she might steal
softly into the dining-room and put it on his plate undetected.Her
eyes were very wide, her brow intent and serious, and her delicate
lips lightly parted.At that moment she bore a striking resemblance to
the Botticelli head in Beulah's drawing-room that she had so greatly
admired.Of all the people concerned in her history, she was the most
tranquilly occupied.Peter in the room beyond was packing his trunk and his suit-case.At
this precise stage of his proceedings he was trying to make two
decisions, equally difficult, but concerned with widely different
departments of his consciousness.He was gravely considering whether
or not to include among his effects the photograph before him on the
dressing-table--that of the girl to whom he had been engaged from the
time he was a Princeton sophomore until her death four years
later--and also whether or not it would be worth his while to order a
new suit of white flannels so late in the season.The fact that he
finally decided against the photograph and in favor of the white
flannels has nothing to do with the relative importance of the two
matters thus engrossing him.The health of the human mind depends
largely on its ability to assemble its irrelevant and incongruous
problems in dignified yet informal proximity.When he went to his desk
it was with the double intention of addressing a letter to his tailor,
and locking the cherished photograph in a drawer; but, the letter
finished, he still held the picture in his hand and gazed down at it
mutely and when the discreet knock on his door that constituted the
announcing of dinner came, he was still sitting motionless with the
photograph propped up before him.Up-town, Beulah, whose dinner hour came late, was rather more
actively, though possibly not more significantly, occupied.She was
doing her best to evade the wild onslaught of a young man in glasses
who had been wanting to marry her for a considerable period, and had
now broken all bounds in a cumulative attempt to inform her of the
fact.Though he was assuredly in no condition to listen to reason, Beulah
was reasoning with him, kindly and philosophically, paying earnest
attention to the style and structure of her remarks as she did so.Her
emotions, as is usual on such occasions, were decidedly mixed.She was
conscious of a very real dismay at her unresponsiveness, a distress
for the acute pain from which the distraught young man seemed to be
suffering, and the thrill, which had she only known it, is the
unfailing accompaniment to the first eligible proposal of marriage.In
the back of her brain there was also, so strangely is the human mind
constituted, a kind of relief at being able to use mature logic once
more, instead of the dilute form of moral dissertation with which she
tried to adapt herself to Eleanor's understanding."I never intend to marry any one," she was explaining gently."I not
only never intend to, but I am pledged in a way that I consider
irrevocably binding never to marry,"--and that was the text from which
all the rest of her discourse developed.Jimmie, equally bound by the oath of celibacy, but not equally
constrained by it apparently, was at the very moment when Beulah was
so successfully repulsing the familiarity of the high cheek-boned
young man in the black and white striped tie, occupied in encouraging
a familiarity of a like nature.That is, he was holding the hand of a
young woman in the darkened corner of a drawing-room which had been
entirely unfamiliar to him ten days before, and was about to impress a
caress on lips that seemed to be ready to meet his with a certain
degree of accustomed responsiveness.That this was not a peculiarly
significant incident in Jimmie's career might have been difficult to
explain, at least to the feminine portion of the group of friends he
cared most for.Margaret, dressed for an academic dinner party, in white net with a
girdle of pale pink and lavender ribbons, had flung herself face
downward on her bed in reckless disregard of her finery; and because
it was hot and she was homesick for green fields and the cool
stretches of dim wooded country, had transported herself in fancy and
still in her recumbent attitude to the floor of a canoe that was
drifting down-stream between lush banks of meadow grass studded with
marsh lilies.After some interval--and shift of position--the way was
arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars came out one by one,
showing faintly between waving branches; and she perceived dimly that
a figure that was vaguely compounded of David and Peter and the
handsomest of all the young kings of Spain, had quietly taken its
place in the bow and had busied itself with the paddles,--whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons and their guests
were awaiting her.David, the only member of the group whose summer vacation had actually
begun, was sitting on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York and looking soberly into
the eyes of a blue ribbon bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his
knees.His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions of the
season's foulards, sleekly corseted and coifed, was sitting less than
a hundred yards away from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David.In the dressing-room above,
just alighted from a limousine de luxe, was a raven-haired,
crafty-eyed ingenue (whose presence David did not suspect or he would
have recollected a sudden pressing engagement out of her vicinity),
preening herself for conquest.David's mind, unlike the minds of the
"other gifted members of the We Are Seven Club," to quote Jimmie's
most frequent way of referring to them, was to all intents and
purposes a total blank.He answered monosyllabically his mother's
questions, patted the dog's beetling forehead and thought of nothing
at all for practically forty-five minutes.Then he rose, and offering
his arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved for him in
the dining-room.Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house in Fifty-sixth Street
where she lived with her parents, was putting the finishing touches on
a faun's head; and a little because she had unconsciously used
Jimmie's head for her model, and a little because of her conscious
realization at this moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody's in the world but Jimmie's, she was thinking of
him seriously.She was thinking also of the dinner on a tray that
would presently be brought up to her, since her mother and father were
out of town, and of her coming two months with Eleanor and her recent
inspiration concerning them.In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner hour and even the
supper hour were long past.In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor's
former home two old people were sitting in calico valanced rockers,
one by either window.The house was a pleasant old colonial structure,
now badly run down but still marked with that distinction that only
the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon a decaying habitation.A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing out unnecessarily,
and let herself in by the back door without knocking.Amos," she said, seating herself in a
straight backed, yellow chair, and swinging her crossed foot
nonchalantly, "I thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.Ma
said that she heard that she was coming home to live again.Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of Eleanor's grandfather.Amos
Chase had ideas of his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.Also Albertina's father
had come from "poor stock."There was a strain of bad blood in her.The women of the Weston families hadn't always "behaved themselves."He therefore answered this representative of the youngest generation
rather shortly."I don't know nothing about it," he said."Why, father," the querulous old voice of Grandmother Chase protested,
"you know she's comin' home somewhere 'bout the end of July, she and
one of her new aunties and a hired girl they're bringing along to do
the work.I don't see why you can't answer the child's question.""I don't know as I'm obligated to answer any questions that anybody
sees fit to put to me."Albertina, pass me my glasses from off the
mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking out from behind the clock
and I'll read what she says."Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr.Amos, who retired coughing
exasperatedly behind a paper that he did not read, allowed herself to
be informed through the medium of a letter from Gertrude and a
postscript from Eleanor of the projected invasion of the Chase
household."I should think you'd rather have Eleanor come home by herself than
bringing a strange woman and a hired girl," Albertina contributed a
trifle tartly.The distinction of a hired girl in the family was one
which she had long craved on her own account."All nonsense, I call it," the old man ejaculated."Well, Eleena, she writes that she can't get away without one of 'em
comin' along with her and I guess we can manage someways.I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen.You can't expect much from
city help.I shall certainly be
dretful pleased to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa--in spite o'
the way he goes on about it."A snort came from the region of the newspaper."I shouldn't think you'd feel as if you had a grandchild now that six
rich people has adopted her," Albertina suggested helpfully."It's a good thing for the child," her grandmother said."I'm so lame
I couldn't do my duty by her.Old folks is old folks, and they can't
do for others like young ones.I'd d'ruther have had her adopted by
one father and mother instead o' this passel o' young folks passing
her around among themselves, but you can't have what you'd d'ruther
have in this world.You got to take what comes and be thankful.""Did she write you about having gold coffee spoons at her last place?""I think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn't know the difference.I guess she has got a lot
of new clothes.Well, I'll have to be getting along.At the precise moment that the door closed behind Albertina, the clock
in Peter Stuyvesant's apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped into her chair at the
dinner table and waited with eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to
make the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.CHAPTER XI

GERTRUDE HAS TROUBLE WITH HER BEHAVIOR


"Dear Uncle Peter," Eleanor wrote from Colhassett when she had been
established there under the new regime for a week or more.I am very awfully sorry, but I could not help it.Don't tell Aunt Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary to the golden rule
that I was.She said
Aunt Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the hired girl was
homely too.Well, I think she is, but I am not going to have Albertina
think so.Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and ink like
hair and lovely teeth and one dimple.Albertina likes hair fuzzed all
over faces and blonds.Then she said she guessed I wasn't your
favorite, and that the gold spoons were most likely tin gilded over.I
don't know what you think about slapping.Will you please write and
say what you think?You know I am anxsuch to do well.But I think I
know as much as Albertina about some things.She uster treat me like a
dog, but it is most a year now since I saw her before."Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.Grandpa did not like
her at first.She looked so much like summer folks, and acted that
way, too.He does not agree with summer folks, but she got him talking
about foreign parts and that Spanish girl that made eyes at him, and
nearly got him away from Grandma, and the time they were wrecked going
around the horn, and showing her dishes and carvings from China.Grandma likes her
too, but not when Grandpa tells her about that girl in Spain."We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely food, only Grandpa does
not like it, but we have him a pie now for breakfast,--his own pie
that he can eat from all the time and he feels better.Aunt Gertrude
is happy seeing him eat it for breakfast and claps her hands when he
does it, only he doesn't see her."She is teaching me more manners, and to swim, and some French.It is
vacation and I don't have regular lessons, the way I did while we
were on Long Island."Didn't we have a good time in that hotel?Do you remember the night I
stayed up till ten o'clock and we sat on the beach and talked?I would miss you more if I believed what Albertina said about my
not being your favorite.Uncle Jimmie is coming and then I
don't know what Albertina will say.Aunt Gertrude's idea of getting me cultivated is
to read to me from the great Masters of literature and funny books
too, like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology.Then I say what I think
of them, and she just lets me develop along those lines, which is
pretty good for summer."The sun and wind are on the sea,
                  The waves are clear and blue,
                This is the place I like to be,
                  If I could just have you."The insects chirrup in the grass,
                  The birds sing in the tree,
                And oh!how quick the time would pass
                  If you were here with me.""What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?"Eleanor asked one
evening when they were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway, and the early moon had
illumined for them."Do you think it's awfully bad to slap any one?""I wouldn't slap you, if that's what you mean, Eleanor.""Would you slap somebody your own size and a little bigger?""I thought perhaps you would," Eleanor sighed with a gasp of relieved
satisfaction."I don't believe in moral suasion entirely, Eleanor," Gertrude tried
to follow Eleanor's leads, until she had in some way satisfied the
child's need for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.It was
not always simple to discover just what Eleanor wanted to know, but
Gertrude had come to believe that there was always some excellent
reason for her wanting to know it."I think there are some quarrels
that have to be settled by physical violence.""I want to bring
myself up good when--when all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don't know.I want to grow up, and be ladylike and a credit, and I'm
getting such good culture that I think I ought to, but--I get worried
about my refinement.City refinement is different from country
refinement.""Refinement isn't a thing that you can worry about," Gertrude began
slowly.She realized perhaps better than any of the others, being a
better balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or Margaret,
that there were serious defects in the scheme of cooperative
parentage.Eleanor, thanks to the overconscientious digging about her
roots, was acquiring a New England self-consciousness about her
processes.A child, Gertrude felt, should be handed a code ready made
and should be guided by it without question until his maturer
experience led him to modify it.The trouble with trying to explain
this to Eleanor was that she had already had too many things
explained to her, and the doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be
inculcated by an exploitation of it."If you are naturally a fine
person your instinct will be to do the fine thing.You must follow it
when you feel the instinct and not think about it between times.""That's Uncle Peter's idea," Eleanor said, "that not thinking.Well,
I'll try--but you and Uncle Peter didn't have six different parents
and a Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing your
refinement in different ways.Don't you ever have any trouble with
your behavior, Aunt Gertrude?"The truth was that she was having considerable
trouble with her behavior since Jimmie's arrival two days before.She
had thought to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod helping
the child to relate her new environment to her old, while she had the
benefit of her native air and the freedom of a rural summer.She also
felt that one of their number ought to have a working knowledge of
Eleanor's early surroundings and habits.She had meant to put herself
and her own concerns entirely aside.If she had a thought for any one
but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two old people whose guest she
had constituted herself.She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two
before her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested that he
spend his own two vacation weeks watching the progress of her
experiment.Before she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him to
do so she had given him permission to come.Jimmie was part of her
trouble.Her craving for isolation and undiscovered country; her
eagerness to escape with her charge to some spot where she would not
be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance, were all a part of
an instinct to segregate herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it.This she realized as soon as
he arrived on the spot.She realized further that she had made
practically no progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude had decided a young
man should be, was rapidly becoming a serious menace to her peace of
mind, and her ideal of a future lived for art alone.She had
definitely begun to realize this on the night when Jimmie, in his
exuberance at securing his new job, had seized her about the waist and
kissed her on the lips.She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
which came dangerously near being her first one.She was too clever,
too cool and aloof, to have had many tentative love-affairs.Later, as
she softened and warmed and gathered grace with the years she was
likely to seem more alluring and approachable to the gregarious male.Now she answered her small interlocutor truthfully."Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble with my behavior.I'm
having trouble with it today, and this evening," she glanced up at the
moon, which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves of effulgence,
"I expect to have more," she confessed.asked Eleanor, "I'm sorry I can't sit up with you then
and help you.You--you don't expect to be--provocated to _slap_
anybody, do you?""No, I don't, but as things are going I almost wish I did," Gertrude
answered, not realizing that before the evening was over there would
be one person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap several times
over.As they turned into the village street from the beach road they met
Jimmie, who had been having his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather
Amos, with whom he had become a prime favorite.With him was
Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing more than
blandly."This virtuous child has been urging me to come after Eleanor and
remind her that it is bedtime," Jimmie said, indicating the pink
gingham clad figure at his side."She argues that Eleanor is some six
months younger than she and ought to be in bed first, and personally
she has got to go in the next fifteen minutes.""It's pretty hot weather to go to bed in," Albertina said."Miss
Sturgis, if I can get my mother to let me stay up half an hour more,
will you let Eleanor stay up?"Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her ample back, Eleanor was
making gestures intended to convey the fact that sitting up any longer
was abhorrent to her."Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think," Gertrude answered,
professionally maternal."I brought Albertina so that our child might go home under convoy,
while you and I were walking on the beach," Jimmie suggested.As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning of their
conversation drifted back to the other two, who stood watching them
for a moment."I thought I'd come over to see if you was willing to say you were
sorry," Albertina began."My face stayed red in one spot for two hours
that day after you slapped me.""I'm not sorry," Eleanor said ungraciously, "but I'll say that I am,
if you've come to make up.""Well, we won't say any more about it then," Albertina conceded."Are
Miss Sturgis and Mr.Sears going together, or are they just friends?""Isn't that Albertina one the limit?"Jimmie inquired, with a piloting
hand under Gertrude's elbow."She told me that she and Eleanor were
mad, but she didn't want to stay mad because there was more going on
over here than there was at her house and she liked to come over.""I'm glad Eleanor slapped her," Gertrude said; "still I'm sorry our
little girl has uncovered the clay feet of her idol.She's through
with Albertina for good.""Do you know, Gertrude," Jimmy said, as they set foot on the
glimmering beach, "you don't seem a bit natural lately.You used to be
so full of the everlasting mischief.Every time you opened your mouth
I dodged for fear of being spiked.Yet here you are just as docile as
other folks.""Don't you like me--as well?"Gertrude tried her best to make her
voice sound as usual."Better," Jimmie swore promptly; then he added a qualifying--"I
guess."But she didn't allow him the opportunity to answer."I'm in a transition period, Jimmie," she said."I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways into which she
has fallen as a result of all her other injudicious training, and,
instead of that, I'm doing nothing but think of myself and my own
hankerings and yearnings and such.I thought I could do so much for
the child.""That's the way we all think till we tackle her and then we find it
quite otherwise and even more so.Tell me about your hankerings and
yearnings.""Tell me about your job, Jimmie."And for a little while they found themselves on safe and familiar
ground again.Jimmie's new position was a very satisfactory one.He
found himself associated with men of solidity and discernment, and for
the first time in his business career he felt himself appreciated and
stimulated by that appreciation to do his not inconsiderable best.Gertrude was the one woman--Eleanor had not yet attained the inches
for that classification--to whom he ever talked business."Now, at last, I feel that I've got my feet on the earth, Gertrude; as
if the stuff that was in me had a chance to show itself, and you don't
know what a good feeling that is after you've been marked trash by
your family and thrown into the dust heap.""I know you are, 'Trude.It isn't
everybody I'd talk to like this.The moonlight beat down upon them in floods of sentient palpitating
glory.Little breathy waves sought the shore and whispered to it.The
pines on the breast of the bank stirred softly and tenderly."Lord, what a night," Jimmie said, and began burying her little white
hand in the beach sand."Now
tell me about your job," he said."I don't think I want to talk about my job tonight."There was no question about her voice sounding as
usual this time.Jimmie brushed the sand slowly away from the buried hand and covered
it with his own.He drew nearer, his face close, and closer to hers.It was coming, it was coming and she was
glad.That silly old vow of celibacy, her silly old thoughts about
art.What was anything with the arms of the man you
loved closing about you.Jimmie drew a sharp breath, and let her go."Gertrude," he said, "I'm incorrigible.I'd
make love to--Eleanor's grandmother if I had her down here on a night
like this.Gertrude got to her feet a little unsteadily, but she managed a
smile."It's only the moon," she said, "and--and young blood.I think
Grandfather Amos would probably affect me the same way."Jimmie's momentary expression of blankness passed and Gertrude did not
press her advantage."It's awfully companionable to realize that you also are human,
'Trude," he hazarded on the doorstep.Gertrude put a still hand into his, which is a way of saying "Good
night," that may be more formal than any other."The Colonel's lady, and July O'Grady," she quoted lightly.Up-stairs in her great chamber under the eaves, Eleanor was composing
a poem which she copied carefully on a light blue page of her private
diary.It read as follows:

                "To love, it is the saddest thing,
                  When friendship proves unfit,
                For lots of sadness it will bring,
                  When e'er you think of it.that friends should prove untrue
                  And disappoint you so.Because you don't know what to do,
                  And hardly where to go."CHAPTER XII

MADAM BOLLING


"Is this the child, David?"Eleanor stared impassively into the lenses of Mrs.Eleanor courtesied as her Uncle Jimmie had taught her, but she did not
take her eyes from Mrs.I hate this American fashion of dressing
children like French dolls, in bright colors and smart lines.An English country child would have
cheeks as red as apples."I should have thought her younger, David.I'll teach her the ropes when the strangeness
begins to wear off.This kind of thing is all new to her, you know."Give her the blue chamber and tell Mademoiselle to
take charge of her.You say you want her to have lessons for so many
hours a day.She writes verses, she models pretty well,
Gertrude says.It's too soon to expect any special aptitude to
develop.""Well, I'm glad to discover your philanthropic tendencies, David.I
never knew you had any before, but this seems to me a very doubtful
undertaking.You take a child like this from very plain surroundings
and give her a year or two of life among cultivated and well-to-do
people, just enough for her to acquire a taste for extravagant living
and associations.You get tired of your
bargain.You marry--and then what
becomes of your protegee?She goes back to the country, a thoroughly
unsatisfied little rustic, quite unfitted to be the wife of the farmer
for whom fate intended her.""I wish you wouldn't, mother," David said, with an uneasy glance at
Eleanor's pale face, set in the stoic lines he remembered so well from
the afternoon of his first impression of her.It never hurts anybody to have a plain understanding of his
position in the world.I don't know what foolishness you romantic
young people may have filled her head with.It's just as well she
should hear common sense from me and I intend that she shall.""I've explained to you, mother, that this child is my legal and moral
responsibility and will be partly at least under my care until she
becomes of age.I want her to be treated as you'd treat a child of
mine if I had one.If you don't, I can't have her visit us again.I
shall take her away with me somewhere.Bringing her home to you this
time is only an experiment.""She'll have a much more healthful and normal experience with us than
she's had with any of the rest of your violent young set, I'll be
bound.She can look out for Zaidee--I
never say that name without irritation--but it's the only name the
little beast will answer to.Eleanor started at the suddenness of the question, but did not reply
to it.Bolling waited and David looked at her expectantly."My mother asked you if you liked dogs, Eleanor; didn't you
understand?"Eleanor opened her lips as if to speak and then shut them again
firmly."Your protegee is slightly deaf, David," his mother assured him."You can tell her 'yes,'" Eleanor said unexpectedly to David."I like
dogs, if they ain't treacherous.""She asked you the question," David said gravely; "this is her house,
you know."Why can't I talk to you about her, the way she does about me?""She can have consideration if she wants it, but she
doesn't think I'm any account.Let her ask you what she wants and I'll
tell you.""Eleanor," David remonstrated, "Eleanor, you never behaved like this
before.I don't know what's got into her, mother."Eleanor fixed her big blue eyes on the lorgnette again."If it's manners to talk the way you do to your own children and
strange little girls, why, then I don't want any," she said."I guess
I'll be going," she added abruptly and turned toward the door.David took her by the shoulders and brought her right about face."Say good-by to mother," he said sternly."Good-by, ma'am--madam," Eleanor said and courtesied primly."Tell Mademoiselle to teach her a few things before the next audience,
David, and come back to me in fifteen minutes.I have something
important to talk over with you."David stood by the open door of the blue chamber half an hour later
and watched Eleanor on her knees, repacking her suit-case.Her face
was set in pale determined lines, and she looked older and a little
sick.Outside it was blowing a September gale, and the trees were
waving desperate branches in the wind.David had thought that the
estate on the Hudson would appeal to the little girl.It had always
appealed to him so much, even though his mother's habits of migration
with the others of her flock at the different seasons had left him so
comparatively few associations with it.He had thought she would like
the broad sweeping lawns and the cherubim fountain, the apple orchard
and the kitchen garden, and the funny old bronze dog at the end of the
box hedge.When he saw how she was occupied, he understood that it was
not her intention to stay and explore these things."Eleanor," he said, stepping into the room suddenly, "what are you
doing with your suit-case?Didn't Mademoiselle unpack it for you?"He
was close enough now to see the signs of tears she had shed.Her eyes fell and she tried desperately to control a quivering lip."Because I am--I want to go back.""I ain't wanted," she said, her head low."I made up my mind to go
back to my own folks.I'm not going to be adopted any more."David led her to the deep window-seat and made her sit facing him.He
was too wise to attempt a caress with this issue between them."Do you think that's altogether fair to me?""I guess it won't make much difference to you."Do you think it will be fair to your other aunts and uncles who have
given so much care and thought to your welfare?""If they do get tired of their bargain it will be because they've
turned out to be very poor sports.I've known every one of them a long
time, and I've never known them to show any signs of poor
sportsmanship yet.If you run away without giving them their chance to
make good, it will be you who are the poor sport.""She said you would marry and get tired of me, and I would have to go
back to the country.If you marry and Uncle Jimmie marries--then Uncle
Peter will marry, and--"

"You'd still have your Aunts Beulah and Margaret and Gertrude," David
could not resist making the suggestion.If one person broke up the vow, I guess they
all would."But even if we did, Eleanor, even if we all married, we'd still
regard you as our own, our child, our charge."The tears came now, and David gathered the
little shaking figure to his breast."I don't want to be the wife of
the farmer for whom fate intended me," she sobbed."I want to marry
somebody refined with extravagant living and associations.""That's one of the things we are bringing you up for, my dear."This
aspect of the case occurred to David for the first time, but he
realized its potency."You mustn't take mother too seriously.Just
jolly her along a little and you'll soon get to be famous friends.She's never had any little girls of her own, only my brother and me,
and she doesn't know quite how to talk to them.""The Hutchinsons had a hired butler and gold spoons, and they didn't
think I was the dust beneath their feet.I don't know what to say to
her.I said ain't, and I wasn't refined, and I'll only just be a
disgrace to you.I'd rather go back to Cape Cod, and go out to work,
and stand Albertina and everything.""If you think it's the square thing to do," David said slowly, "you
may go, Eleanor.I'll take you to New York to-morrow and get one of
the girls to take you to Colhassett.Of course, if you do that it will
put me in rather an awkward position.The others have all had you for
two months and made good on the proposition.I shall have to admit
that I couldn't even keep you with me twenty-four hours.Peter and
Jimmie got along all right, but I couldn't handle you at all.As a
cooperative parent, I'm such a failure that the whole experiment goes
to pieces through me.""Well, it's the same thing,--you couldn't stand the surroundings I
brought you to.You couldn't even be polite to my mother for my
sake.""I--never thought of that, Uncle David.""Think of it now for a few minutes, won't you, Eleanor?"The rain was beginning to lash the windows, and to sweep the lawn in
long slant strokes.The little girl held up her face as if it could
beat through the panes on it."I thought," she said slowly, "that after Albertina I wouldn't _take_
anything from anybody.Uncle Peter says that I'm just as good as
anybody, even if I have been out to work.He said that all I had to do
was just to stand up to people.""There are a good many different ways of standing up to people,
Eleanor.Be sure you've got the right way and then go ahead.""I guess I ought to have been politer," Eleanor said slowly."I ought
to have thought that she was your own mother.You couldn't help the
way she acted, o' course.""The way you acted is the point, Eleanor.""I'll act different if you want me to, Uncle David," she said, "and I
won't go and leave you."I don't think that I altogether cover myself
with glory in an interview with my mother," he added."It isn't the
thing that I'm best at, I admit.""You did pretty good," Eleanor consoled him."I guess she makes you
kind of bashful the way she does me," from which David gathered with
an odd sense of shock that Eleanor felt there was something to
criticize in his conduct, if she had permitted herself to look for
it."I know what I'll do," Eleanor decided dreamily with her nose against
the pane."I'll just pretend that she's Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt, and then
whatever she does, I shan't care.I'll know that I'm the strongest and
could hit her if I had a mind to, and then I shan't want to.""By the time you grow up, Eleanor," he said finally, "you will have
developed all your cooperative parents into fine strong characters.*       *       *       *       *

"The dog got nearly drownded today in the founting," Eleanor wrote."It is a very little dog about the size of Gwendolyn.It was out with
Mademoiselle, and so was I, learning French on a garden seat.It
teetered around on the edge of the big wash basin--the founting looks
like a wash basin, and suddenly it fell in.I waded right in and got
it, but it slipped around so I couldn't get it right away.It looked
almost too dead to come to again, but I gave it first aid to the
drownded the way Uncle Jimmie taught me to practicing on Gwendolyn.When I got it fixed I looked up and saw Uncle David's mother coming.I
took the dog and gave it to her.I said, 'Madam, here's your dog.'Mademoiselle ran around ringing her hands and talking about it.Bolling's room, and we talked.I told her how to make
mustard pickles, and how my mother's grandpa's relation came over in
the Mayflower, and about our single white lilac bush, and she's going
to get one and make the pickles.Then I played double Canfield with
her for a while.I'm glad I didn't go home before I knew her better.O'Farrel's aunt I pretend she is her, and we
don't quarrel.She says does Uncle David go much to see Aunt Beulah,
and I say, not so often as Uncle Jimmie does.Then she says does he go
to see Aunt Margaret, and I say that he goes to see Uncle Peter the
most.Well, if he doesn't he almost does.Madam
Bolling that you won't tattle, because she would think the worst."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor grew to like Mademoiselle.She was the aging, rather wry
faced Frenchwoman who had been David's young brother's governess and
had made herself so useful to Mrs.Bolling that she was kept always on
the place, half companion and half resident housekeeper.She was glad
to have a child in charge again, and Eleanor soon found that her
crooked features and severe high-shouldered back that had somewhat
intimidated her at first, actually belonged to one of the kindest
hearted creatures in the world.Paris and Colhassett bore very little resemblance to each other, the
two discovered.To be sure there were red geraniums every alternating
year in the gardens of the Louvre, and every year in front of the
Sunshine Library in Colhassett.The residents of both places did a
great deal of driving in fine weather.In Colhassett they drove on the
state highway, recently macadamized to the dismay of the taxpayers who
did not own horses or automobiles.In Paris they drove out to the Bois
by way of the Champs Elysees.In Colhassett they had only one
ice-cream saloon, but in Paris they had a good many of them
out-of-doors in the parks and even on the sidewalk, and there you
could buy all kinds of sirups and 'what you call cordials' and
_aperitifs_; but the two places on the whole were quite different.The people of Colhassett were all
religious and thought it was sinful to play cards on Sundays.Mademoiselle said she always felt wicked when she played them on a
week day."I think of my mother," she said; "she would say 'Juliette, what will
you say to the Lord when he knows that you have been playing cards on
a working day."The Lord that they have in Colhassett is not like that," Eleanor
stated without conscious irreverence."She is a vary fonny child, madam," Mademoiselle answered Mrs."She has taste, but no--experience even of the most
ordinary.She cooks, but she does no embroidery.She knits and knows
no games to play.She has a good brain, but Mon Dieu, no one has
taught her to ask questions with it.""She has had lessons this year from some young Rogers graduates, very
intelligent girls.I should think a year of that kind of training
would have had its effect."Bolling's finger went into every pie
in her vicinity with unfailing direction."Lessons, yes, but no teaching.If she were not vary intelligent I
think she would have suffered for it.The public schools they did
somesing, but so little to elevate--to encourage."Thus in a breath were Beulah's efforts as an educator disposed of."Would you like to undertake the teaching of that child for a year?""I think I'll make the offer to David."Bolling was unsympathetic but she was thorough.Since David and his young friends had undertaken
a venture so absurd, she decided to lend them a helping hand with it.Besides, now that she had no children of her own in the house,
Mademoiselle was practically eating her head off.Also it had
developed that David was fond of the child, so fond of her that to
oppose that affection would have been bad policy, and Mrs.Bolling was
politic when she chose to be.She chose to be politic now, for
sometime during the season she was going to ask a very great favor of
David, and she hoped, that by first being extraordinarily complaisant
and kind and then by bringing considerable pressure to bear upon him,
he would finally do what he was asked.The favor was to provide
himself with a father-in-law, and that father-in-law the
multi-millionaire parent of the raven-haired, crafty-eyed ingenue, who
had begun angling for him that June night at the country club.She made the suggestion to David on the eve of the arrival of all of
Eleanor's guardians for the week-end.Bolling had invited a
house-party comprised of the associated parents as a part of her
policy of kindness before the actual summoning of her forces for the
campaign she was about to inaugurate.David was really touched by his mother's generosity concerning
Eleanor.He had been agreeably surprised at the development of the
situation between the child and his mother.He had been obliged to go
into town the day after Eleanor's first unfortunate encounter with her
hostess, and had hurried home in fear and trembling to try to smooth
out any tangles in the skein of their relationship that might have
resulted from a day in each other's vicinity.After hurrying over the
house and through the grounds in search of her he finally discovered
the child companionably currying a damp and afflicted Pekinese in his
mother's sitting-room, and engaged in a grave discussion of the
relative merits of molasses and sugar as a sweetening for Boston baked
beans.It was while they were having their after-dinner coffee in the
library, for which Eleanor had been allowed to come down, though
nursery supper was the order of the day in the Bolling establishment,
that David told his friends of his mother's offer."Of course, we decided to send her to school when she was twelve
anyway," he said."The idea was to keep her among ourselves for two
years to establish the parental tie, or ties I should say.If she is
quartered here with Mademoiselle we could still keep in touch with her
and she would be having the advantage of a year's steady tuition under
one person, and we'd be relieved--" a warning glance from Margaret,
with an almost imperceptible inclination of her head in the direction
of Beulah, caused him to modify the end of his sentence--"of the
responsibility--for her physical welfare.""Mentally and morally," Gertrude cut in, "the bunch would still
supervise her entirely."Jimmie, who was sitting beside her, ran his arm along the back of her
chair affectionately, and then thought better of it and drew it away.He was, for some unaccountable reason, feeling awkward and not like
himself.There was a girl in New York, with whom he was not in the
least in love, who had recently taken it upon herself to demonstrate
unmistakably that she was not in love with him.There was another girl
who insisted on his writing her every day.Here was Gertrude, who
never had any time for him any more, absolutely without enthusiasm at
his proximity.He thought it would be a good idea to allow Eleanor to
remain where she was and said so."Not that I won't miss the jolly times we had together, Babe," he
said."I was planning some real rackets this year,--to make up for
what I put you through," he added in her ear, as she came and stood
beside him for a minute.Gertrude wanted to go abroad for a year, "and lick her wounds," as she
told herself.She would have come back for her two months with
Eleanor, but she was glad to be relieved of that necessity.Margaret
had the secret feeling that the ordeal of the Hutchinsons was one that
she would like to spare her foster child, and incidentally herself in
relation to the adjustment of conditions necessary to Eleanor's visit.Peter wanted her with him, but he believed the new arrangement would
be better for the child.Beulah alone held out for her rights and her
parental privileges.She stood in the center of the group a little forlornly while they
awaited her word.A wave of her old shyness overtook her and she
blushed hot and crimson."It's all in your own hands, dear," Beulah said briskly."Poor kiddie," Gertrude thought, "it's all wrong somehow.""I don't know what you want me to say," Eleanor said piteously and
sped to the haven of Peter's breast."We'll manage a month together anyway," Peter whispered."Then I guess I'll stay here," she whispered back, "because next I
would have to go to Aunt Beulah's."Peter, turning involuntarily in Beulah's direction, saw the look of
chagrin and disappointment on her face, and realized how much she
minded playing a losing part in the game and yet how well she was
doing it."She's only a straight-laced kid after all," he thought."She's put her whole heart and soul into this thing.There's a look
about the top part of her face when it's softened that's a little like
Ellen's."Ellen was his dead fiancee--the girl in the photograph at
home in his desk."I guess I'll stay here," Eleanor said aloud, "all in one place, and
study with Mademoiselle."It was a decision that, on the whole, she never regretted.CHAPTER XIII

BROOK AND RIVER


                   "Standing with reluctant feet,
                   Where the brook and river meet.""I think it's a good plan to put a quotation like Kipling at the top
of the page whenever I write anything in this diary," Eleanor began in
the smart leather bound book with her initials stamped in black on the
red cover--the new private diary that had been Peter's gift to her on
the occasion of her fifteenth birthday some months before."I think it
is a very expressive thing to do.The quotation above is one that
expresses me, and I think it is beautiful too.Miss Hadley--that's my
English teacher--the girls call her Haddock because she does look
rather like a fish--says that it's undoubtedly one of the most
poignant descriptions of adolescent womanhood ever made.I made a note
to look up adolescent, but didn't.Bertha Stephens has my dictionary,
and won't bring it back because the leaves are all stuck together
with fudge, and she thinks she ought to buy me a new one.It is very
honorable of her to feel that way, but she never will.Good old
Stevie, she's a great borrower."'Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
             For borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.'"Well, I hardly know where to begin.I thought I would make a resume
of some of the events of the last year.I was only fourteen then, but
still I did a great many things that might be of interest to me in my
declining years when I look back into the annals of this book.To
begin with I was only a freshie at Harmon.It is very different to be
a sophomore.I can hardly believe that I was once a shivering looking
little thing like all the freshmen that came in this year.I was very
frightened, but did not think I showed it.wad some power the giftie gie us,
               To see ourselves as others see us.'"Robert Burns had twins and a rather bad character, but after he met
his bonnie Jean he wrote very beautiful poetry.A poet's life is
usually sad anyhow--full of disappointment and pain--but I digress."I had two years with Mademoiselle at the Bollings' instead of one the
way we planned.I haven't written in my Private Diary since the night
of that momentous decision that I was to stay in one place instead of
taking turns visiting my cooperative parents.I went to another school
one year before I came to Harmon, and that brings me to the threshold
of my fourteenth year.If I try to go back any farther, I'll never
catch up.I spent that vacation with Aunt Margaret in a cottage on
Long Island with her sister, and her sister's boy, who has grown up to
be the silly kind that wants to kiss you and pull your hair, and those
things.Aunt Margaret is so lovely I can't think of words to express
it.rare pale Margaret,' as Tennyson says.She wears her hair in
a coronet braid around the top of her head, and all her clothes are
the color of violets or a soft dovey gray or white, though baby blue
looks nice on her especially when she wears a fishyou."I went down to Cape Cod for a week before I came to Harmon, and while
I was there my grandmother died.I can't write about that in this
diary.I loved my grandmother and my grandmother loved me.Uncle Peter
came, and took charge of everything.He has great strength that holds
you up in trouble."The first day I came to Harmon I saw the girl I wanted for my best
friend, and so we roomed together, and have done so ever since.Her
name is Margaret Louise Hodges, but she is called Maggie Lou by every
one.She has dark curly hair, and deep brown eyes, and a very silvery
voice.I have found out that she lies some, but she says it is because
she had such an unhappy childhood, and has promised to overcome it for
my sake."That Christmas vacation the 'We Are Sevens' went up the Hudson to the
Bollings' again, but that was the last time they ever went there.Uncle David and his mother had a terrible fight over them.I was sorry
for Madam Bolling in a way.There was a girl she wanted Uncle David to
marry, a rich girl who looked something like Cleopatra, very dark
complexioned with burning eyes.She had a sweet little Pekinese
something like Zaidee."Uncle David said that gold could never buy him, and to take her away,
but Madam Bolling was very angry, of course.She accused him of
wanting to marry Aunt Margaret, and called her a characterless, faded
blonde.Then it was Uncle David's turn to get angry, and I have never
seen any one get any angrier, and he told about the vow of celibacy,
and how instead of having designs on him the whole crowd would back
him up in his struggle to stay single.I told
Madam Bolling that I would help her to get Uncle David back, and I
did, but she never forgave the other aunts and uncles.I suppose the
feelings of a mother would prompt her to want Uncle David settled down
with a rich and fashionable girl who would soon be the mother of a lot
of lovely children.I can't imagine a Cleopatra looking baby, but she
might have boys that looked like Uncle David."Vacations are really about all there is to school.Freshman year is
mostly grinding and stuffing.Having six parents to send you boxes of
'grub' is better than having only two.Some of the girls are rather
selfish about the eats, and come in and help themselves boldly when
you are out of the room.Maggie Lou puts up signs over the candy box:
'Closed for Repairs,' or 'No Trespassing by Order of the Board of
Health,' but they don't pay much attention.Well, last summer vacation
I spent with Uncle Jimmie.I wouldn't tell this, but I reformed him.I don't know what pledge it was because I
didn't read it, but he said he was addicted to something worse than
anything I could think of, and if somebody didn't pull him up, he
wouldn't answer for the consequences.I asked him why he didn't choose
Aunt Gertrude to do it, and he groaned only.So I said to write out a
pledge, and sign it and I would be the witness.We were at a hotel
with his brother's family.It isn't proper any more for me to go
around with my uncles unless I have a chaperon.Mademoiselle says that
I oughtn't even to go down-town alone with them but, of course, that
is French etiquette, and not American.Well, there were lots of pretty
girls at this hotel, all wearing white and pink dresses, and carrying
big bell shaped parasols of bright colors.They looked sweet, like so
many flowers, but Uncle Jimmie just about hated the sight of them.He
said they were not girls at all, but just pink and white devices of
the devil.On the whole he didn't act much like my merry uncle, but we
had good times together playing tennis and golf, and going on parties
with his brother's family, all mere children but the mother and
father.Uncle Jimmie was afraid to go and get his mail all summer,
although he had a great many letters on blue and lavender note paper
scented with Roger et Gallet's violet, and Hudnut's carnation.We used
to go down to the beach and make bonfires and burn them unread, and
then toast marshmallows in their ashes.He said that they were
communications from the spirits of the dead.I should have thought
that they were from different girls, but he seemed to hate the sight
of girls so much.Once I asked him if he had ever had an unhappy
love-affair, just to see what he would say, but he replied 'no, they
had all been happy ones,' and groaned and groaned."Aunt Beulah has changed too.She has become a suffragette and thinks
only of getting women their rights and their privileges."Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments about the cause.She says that woman's place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and brew like the women of my
grandfather's day, visiting around the way I do?And she says that it
is the principle of the thing that is involved, and I ought to take a
stand for or against.Everybody has so many different arguments that I
don't know what I think yet, but some day I shall make up my mind for
good."Well, that about brings me up to the present.I meant to describe a
few things in detail, but I guess I will not begin on the past in that
way.I don't get so awfully much time to write in this diary because
of the many interruptions of school life, and the way the monitors
snoop in study hours.I don't know who I am going to spend my
Christmas holidays with.I sent Uncle Peter a poem three days ago, but
he has not answered it yet.I'm afraid he thought it was very silly.I
don't hardly know what it means myself.It goes as follows:

                              "A Song

                "The moon is very pale to-night,
                  The summer wind swings high,
                I seek the temple of delight,
                  And feel my love draw nigh."I seem to feel his fragrant breath
                  Upon my glowing cheek.Between us blows the wind of death,--
                  I shall not hear him speak."I don't know why I like to write love poems, but most of the women
poets did.CHAPTER XIV

MERRY CHRISTMAS


Margaret in mauve velvet and violets, and Gertrude in a frock of smart
black and white were in the act of meeting by appointment at Sherry's
one December afternoon, with a comfortable cup of tea in mind.Gertrude emerged from the recess of the revolving door and Margaret,
sitting eagerly by the entrance, almost upset the attendant in her
rush to her friend's side.Gertrude," she cried, "I'm so glad to see you.My family is
trying to cut me up in neat little quarters and send me north, south,
east and west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to stay home and
have Eleanor.How did I ever come to be born into a family of giants,
tell me that, Gertrude?""The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an unfortunately immature
period, I'll admit," Gertrude laughed."My parents are dears, but
they've never forgiven me for being an artist instead of a dubby bud.Shall we have tea right away or shall we sit down and discuss life?""I don't know which is the hungrier--flesh or
spirit."But as they turned toward the dining-room a familiar figure blocked
their progress."I thought that was Gertrude's insatiable hat," David exclaimed
delightedly."I've phoned for you both until your families have given
instructions that I'm not to be indulged any more.I've got a surprise
for you.--Taxi," he said to the man at the door."Not till we've had our tea," Margaret wailed."You couldn't be so
cruel, David.""You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of the happiest surprises
of your life into the bargain," David assured her as he led the way to
the waiting cab."I wouldn't leave this place unfed for anybody but you, David, not if
it were ever so, and then some, as Jimmie says.""What's the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?"David inquired as the taxi
turned down the Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a hopeless
mesh of traffic.Gertrude answered, though she had not been the
one addressed at the moment.she
rattled on without waiting for an answer."I thought it was
good-looking myself, and Madam Paran robbed me for it.""It is good-looking," David allowed."It seems to be a kind of
retrieving hat, that's all.Keeps you in a rather constant state of
looking after the game."It's a lovely cross
between the style affected by the late Emperor Napoleon and my august
grandmother, with some frills added."The chauffeur turned into a cross street and stopped abruptly before
an imposing but apparently unguarded entrance."Why, I thought this was a studio building," Gertrude said."David, if
you're springing a tea party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I'll shoot the way my hat is pointing.""Straight through my left eye-glass," David finished."You wait till
you see the injustice you have done me."But Margaret, who often understood what was happening a few moments
before the revelation of it, clutched at his elbow.David, David," she whispered, "how wonderful!""Wait till you see," David said, and herded them into the elevator.David hurried them around
the bend in the sleekly carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to.It opened almost instantly and
David's man, who was French, stood bowing and smiling on the
threshold.Styvvisont has arrive'," he said; "he waits you.""Welcome to our city," Peter cried, appearing in the doorway of the
room Alphonse was indicating with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way."Jimmie's coming up from the
office and Beulah's due any minute.What do you think of the place,
girls?""It's really
ours, that's what it is.I've broken away from the mater at last," he
added a little sheepishly.I've got an
all-day desk job in my uncle's office and I'm going to dig in and see
what I can make of myself.Also, this is going to be our headquarters,
and Eleanor's permanent home if we're all agreed upon it,--but look
around, ladies.If you think I can interior
decorate, just tell me so frankly."It's like that old conundrum--black and white and red all over,"
Gertrude said."I never saw anything so stunning in all my life."I admire your nerve," Peter cried, "papering this place in
white, and then getting in all this heavy carved black stuff, and the
red in the tapestries and screens and pillows.""I wanted it to look studioish a little," David explained, "I wanted
to get away from Louis Quartorze.""And drawing-rooms like mother used to make," Gertrude suggested.Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian
or Chinese?The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous by its
absence.""I've got two portfolios full of 'em," David said, "and I always have
one or two up in the bedrooms.I change 'em around, you know, the way
the <DW61>s do themselves, a different scene every few days and the rest
decently out of sight till you're ready for 'em.""It's like a fairy story," Margaret said."I thought you'd appreciate what little Arabian Nights I was able to
introduce.I bought that screen," he indicated a sweep of Chinese line
and color, "with my eye on you, and that Aladdin's lamp is yours, of
course.You're to come in here and rub it whenever you like, and your
heart's desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you."Peter suggested, as David led the way through
the corridor and up the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment."This is her room, didn't you say, David?"He paused on the threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk."She once said that she wanted a yellow room," David said, "a
daffy-down-dilly room, and I've tried to get her one.I know last
year that Maggie Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor refused to be
comforted."A wild whoop in the below stairs announced Jimmie; and Beulah arrived
simultaneously with the tea tray.Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him."Headquarters is the one thing we've lacked," he said; "a place of our
own, hully gee!"You haven't been feeling altogether human lately, have you, Jimmie?""I'm a bad
egg," he explained to her darkly, "and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.""Scrambled is just about the way I should have described your behavior
of late,--but that's Gertrude's line," David said."Only she doesn't
seem to be taking an active part in the conversation.Aren't you
Jimmie's keeper any more, Gertrude?""Not since she's come back from abroad," Jimmie muttered without
looking at her."Eleanor's taken the job over now," Peter said."She's made him swear
off red ink and red neckties.""Any color so long's it's red is the color that suits me best," Jimmie
quoted."Lord, isn't this room a pippin?"He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a moment.It had been a
good many weeks since he had seen Gertrude."I want to give a suffrage tea here," Beulah broke in suddenly."It's
so central, but I don't suppose David would hear of it.""Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us--" Peter began."My _mother_ would hear of it," David said, "and then there wouldn't
be any little studio any more.She doesn't believe in votes for
women.""How any woman in this day and age--" Beulah began, and thought better
of it, since she was discussing Mrs."Makes your blood boil, doesn't it--Beulahland?"Gertrude suggested
helpfully, reaching for the tea cakes."Never mind, I'll vote for
women."The Lord helps those that help themselves," Peter said, "that's why
Gertrude is a suffragist.She believes in helping herself, in every
sense, don't you, 'Trude?""Not quite in every sense," Gertrude said gravely."Sometimes I feel
like that girl that Margaret describes as caught in a horrid way
between two generations."I'd rather be that way than early Victorian," Margaret sighed."Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody any objection to
having our child here for the holidays?""My idea is to
have one grand Christmas dinner.I suppose we'll all have to eat one
meal with our respective families, but can't we manage to get together
here for dinner at night?"We can't, but we will," Margaret murmured.I wanted her with me but the family thought otherwise.They've
been trying to send me away for my health, David."You'll stay in New York for your health and come
to my party.""Margaret's health is merely a matter of Margaret's happiness anyhow.Her soul and her body are all one," Gertrude said."Then cursed be he who brings anything but happiness to Margaret,"
Peter said, to which sentiment David added a solemn "Amen.""I wish you wouldn't," Margaret said, shivering a little, "I feel as
if some one were--were--"

"Trampling the violets on your grave," Gertrude finished for her.Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and Eleanor did not leave school
till the Friday before the great day.Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see her before the dinner
party itself.Even David was busy with his mother--installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her home until the opening
of the season at Palm Beach--and had only a few hurried words with
her.Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for the occasion, met her at
the station and helped her to do her modest shopping which consisted
chiefly of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles.She had arranged
these things lovingly at their plates, and fled to dress when they
began to assemble for the celebration.The girls were the first
arrivals."I had a few minutes' talk
with her over the telephone and she seemed to be flourishing.""She's grown several feet since we last saw
her.They've been giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and she's
been playing Juliet, it appears.She has had a fight with another girl
about suffrage--I don't know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me--and the other girl was
so unpleasant about it that she has been visited by just retribution
in the form of the mumps, and had to be sent home and quarantined.""Sounds a bit priggish," Peter suggested."Not really," David said, "she's as sound as a nut.She's only going
through the different stages.""To pass deliberately through one's ages," Beulah quoted, "is to get
the heart out of a liberal education.""Bravo, Beulah," Gertrude cried, "you're quite in your old form
to-night.""Is she just the same little girl, David?"I don't know why
she doesn't come down.No, it's only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie."Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived under the holiday
influence, was staggering under the weight of his parcels.The
Christmas presents had already accumulated to a considerable mound on
the couch.Margaret was brooding over them and trying not to look
greedy.She was still very much of a child herself in relation to
Santa Claus.My eyes--but you're a slick trio, girls.Pale
lavender, pale blue, and pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly
decollete.I don't know quite why
you do, but you do.""Give honor where honor is due, dearie.That's owing to the cleverness
of the decorator," David said."No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the tale," Jimmie remarked
almost dreamily as he squared off.But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.Alphonse
threw open the big entrance door at the farther end of the long room
with a flourish."Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet," he proclaimed with the grand air, and
then retired behind his hand, smiling broadly.Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and curls, softly rounding
bodice, and the long, straight lines of the Renaissance, stood
Juliet--Juliet, immemorial, immortal, young--austerely innocent and
delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet potential of all the beauty
and the wisdom of the world."I've never worn these clothes before anybody but the girls before,"
Eleanor said, "but I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you
might like it--for a surprise.""Great jumping Jehoshaphat," Jimmie exclaimed, "I thought you said she
was the same little girl, David.""She was half an hour ago," David answered, "I never saw such a
metamorphosis.In fact, I don't think I ever saw Juliet before.""She is the thing itself," Gertrude answered, the artist in her
sobered by the vision.But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes and stared at the delicate
figure advancing to him.she's a woman," he said, and drew the hard breath of a man
just awakened from sleep.[Illustration: "I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you might
like it--for a surprise"]




CHAPTER XV

GROWING UP


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"It was a pleasant surprise to get letters from every one of my uncles
the first week I got back to school.You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and Uncle Peter sixteen.He
is the best correspondent, but perhaps that is because I ask him the
most advice.I shall never forget the
expressions on all the different faces when I came down in my Juliet
suit.I thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I guess they
did."You know how well I liked my presents because you heard my wild
exclamations of delight.It was
sweet of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set, and to know that
every different piece was the loving thought of a different aunt or
uncle.It looks entirely unique, and I
like to have things that are not like anybody else's in the world,
don't you, Uncle Jimmie?They are
'neat,' but not 'gaudy.'You play golf so well I thought a golf stick
was a nice emblem for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer."I am glad you think it is easier to keep your pledge now.I made a
New Year's resolution to go without chocolates, and give the money
they would cost to some good cause, but it's hard to pick out a cause,
or to decide exactly how much money you are saving.I can eat the
chocolates that are sent to me, however!!!!"Uncle David said that he thought you were not like yourself lately,
but you seemed just the same to me Christmas, only more affectionate.I was really only joking about the chocolates.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle David:

"I was glad to get your nice letter.You did not have to write in
response to my bread and butter letter, but I am glad you did.When I
am at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as if I were
living two beautiful lives all at once, the life of a 'cooperative
child' and the life of Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together.Letters make the people you love seem very near to you, don't you
think they do?I sleep with all my letters under my pillow whenever I
feel the least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to breathe
sometimes.Maggie Lou had a wrist watch, too, for
Christmas, but not so pretty as the one you gave me.Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel like it.I don't know
whether that's a compliment or not.I took Kris Kringle for the
subject of a theme the other day, and represented him as caught in an
iceberg in the grim north, and not being able to reach all the poor
little children in the tenements and hovels.The Haddock said it
showed imagination."There was a lecture at school on Emerson the other day.The speaker
was a noted literary lecturer from New York.He had wonderful waving
hair, more like Pader--I can't spell him, but you know who I
mean--than Uncle Jimmie's, but a little like both.He introduced some
very noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly old ideas in
a new way that made you think a lot more of them.I think a tall man
like that with waving hair can do a great deal of good as a lecturer,
because you listen a good deal more respectfully than if they were
plain looking.His voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo's voice did.I had a nice letter from Madam Bolling.I love you,
and I have come to the bottom of the sheet.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle Peter:

"I have just written to my other uncles, so I won't write you a long
letter this time.They deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays.You always deserve letters, but not
specially now, any more than any other time."Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather.It seems funny to think of
Albertina's aunt taking care of him now that Grandma is gone.I
suppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for
Christmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I
used to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her
back when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,
Uncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on
her finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will
enclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It
isn't very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life

                 "Life is a great, a noble task,
                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,
                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where
                   Our dim pathway is leading,
                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,
                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,
                   Nor stop to question whither.E'en if we drink the bitter cup,
                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven't got the last verse very good yet, but I think the
second one is pretty.You know 'love-lies-bleeding' is a flower, but
it sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor's fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of
her life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve
exceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and
spontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and
play and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she
developed into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,
with a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor
herself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred
the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many
unhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the
inexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David's apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,
though the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by
herself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her
grandfather, now in charge of Albertina's aunt.She found Albertina
grown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who
plied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles
of New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of
that vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often
carries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken
care of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had
never done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility
of this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been
warmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her
simplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her
adoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the
expense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked
back incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a
state of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little
else that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden
sass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the
straggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,
helping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment
that she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again
whenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret
Louise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most
significant event of the entire year took place, though it was a
happening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never
thought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of
a moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he
had asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don't want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey
a sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom
she was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don't know you well
enough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that
hung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don't know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the
amenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You're an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the
chair from which she had half arisen."I don't believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words
would not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the
arrival of some member of the family.The boy's face was close to
hers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he
would talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there's no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches
in it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don't be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I'm not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you
hadn't, that's all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,
with an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between
herself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys
with mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and
colorless.Beulah's militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her
new interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first
delicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager
under her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and
hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to
get any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was
quite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that
dreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and
learned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of
apprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had
that year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor
of the romance languages and the other from a young society man,
already losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred
by the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the
dawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow
of celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had
seemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of
men, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York
business life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a
financier to his mother's surprise and amazement; and the pressure
relaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,
two mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling's list as suitable
parents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him
adroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,
modern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,
suffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges
of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in
reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those
with whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his
own woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself
as a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times
with a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired
earth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be
the vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an
amusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the
early death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him
for a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the
little girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a
woman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms
around him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child
beating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of
parenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected
by the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation
to their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual
concept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped
blindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both
understood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers
met and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering
unction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and
women, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in
common, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by
side in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward
instead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the
curious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor
stooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their
unconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI

MARGARET LOUISA'S BIRTHRIGHT


"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and
I have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never
wanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and
pain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long
years, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that
Bertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking
me.I don't like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do
little things for her that would win back her affection, but with no
success.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as
she called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,
which she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the
plague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I
always talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie's
character.I've always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is
that she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer
laziness not do it.She gummed it
all up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn't give it back to me or
get me another, but the reason she wouldn't give it back to me was
because her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and
not fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That's
only one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was
_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,
because I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any
reason why I shouldn't.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has
been up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so
spoony.He isn't as spoony as Margaret Louise's brother, but he's
quite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise
that I didn't like Stevie's brother, and then I made the damaging
remark that one reason I didn't like him was because he looked so much
like Stevie.I didn't bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her
Maggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I
thought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a
snow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is
a snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his
name is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a
good idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too
many dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don't mean
to use slang in my diary, but I can't seem to help it.Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in
replenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that'many
are called, and few are chosen,' and there is no need to try to
accommodate them all in one's vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how
he tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the
girls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I
told her everything else in the world that happened to come into my
head."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior
year, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with
things just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had
this queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I'd just go
around and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one
day when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found
out that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every
living thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only
without the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,
and when she was through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to
gaze into Stevie's overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as
I could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever
spent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her 'nothing
extenuate, and naught set down in malice,' and what I had said about
her to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of
either of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things
that she said she didn't think she would ever forget that I had said
about her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike
of her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the
bitterness to know that I wasn't really her enemy.She said that my
coming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of
character, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret
Louise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had
done.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that
upsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the
evidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that
in a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the
trouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you are to expect a
betrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a
clear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_
what you know."I won't even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret
Louise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she
argued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I
tried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in
a way that was dreadful.I've seen her do something like it before
about different things, and I ought to have known then what she was
like inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such
a scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, 'Margaret Louise, if that's all you've got to say
about the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us
from this minute;' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I
thought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don't
know whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or
not; I don't quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I
had a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very
strange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural
somehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent
with them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your
beautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, 'What Life Means to
Me,' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the
girls, but I've been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in
just so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would
transcribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my
grandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the
world,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of
my aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to
be without.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she
would never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as
if he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts
feel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that
way about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and
feel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel
that way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am
certain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there
is only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be
Uncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of
pottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live
in forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII

A REAL KISS


At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year
of preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart
that she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher
education should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in
all its bearings."If she doesn't decide in favor of college," David said, "and she
makes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't
see what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet
eligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at
his apartment."You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten
me sometimes.""You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of
eligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don't want her to be
married.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her
up quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her
off there won't be any comfort in having her.""I don't know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,
too.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the
most interesting games in the world.""That's not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like
things very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that
except for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very
little about you, Margaret.""There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.""That's a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems
to be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a
field of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,
don't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's
very improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and
your ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don't go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll
send out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I'm a little bit tired of being
one, that's all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and
cryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my
hearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting
her gloves to her fingers."I don't know exactly what it was I saw,
but it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the
creeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I
have a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of
Frankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's
going to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I
wouldn't say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of
owning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,
had his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something
very precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift
had been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more
silent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he
was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if
she had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights
of stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted
to hear your voice speaking.""If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you
ought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is
that the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,
while a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more
carefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when
he called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone
again died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she
wished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in
the most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an
obsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden
gasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of
the increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming
the airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in
the trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea
that she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already
grown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,
into his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you
looked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her
skirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to
speak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the
waiting motor."It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't
notice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally
unobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your
being a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been
rather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of
triviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has
grown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?"He's all the time wanting me to get you to
New York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller
than you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You
know she's on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her
room, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like
a heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you
added jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I'm not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it's only because
she's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.""It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody
should ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like
the famous primrose on the river's brim.""'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and
nothing more,'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off
suddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the
river's brim?""I don't know, I'm sure.I'm a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your
Aunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look
unlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with
youth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned
saucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,
but aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party
types, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,
with her hair in a braid."She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind
of middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of
the same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's
growing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She's theory ridden and fad bitten.She'll come to a bad end if
something doesn't stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle
David.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the
way she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your
rights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off
key, that's all.Your poor old
cooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other
place does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly
upon her.I didn't know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a
woman--"

Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound
box of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the
moment."What's devouring you, papa?""Don't I always place
tributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It's only
the labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should
go to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing
the family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long
visits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at
suffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the
shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently
with David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his
after-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I'd love it,--if--"

"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I'm going to earn my own living, you know."I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents
have accustomed you?""I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting
you do things for me forever."It doesn't seem--right, that's all.""It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious
varieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you
to do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better
fitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real
college."I can't think,--I'm stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my
mind."Eleanor, we're all
able to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided
among six of us.When did you come to
this extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.I told Uncle
Peter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I
want you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe
the best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there
would be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't
know.""You're an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how
extraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I
don't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you
do want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a
pursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own
living.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If
you're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on
it immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held
high.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and
the tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had
refrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out
his hand to her."There is only one way
for a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in
her eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A
hot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn't get such
things confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or
until you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,
but if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,
you are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have
something to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"

David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII

BEULAH'S PROBLEM


Peter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner
party for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After
that they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from
there to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that
were forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade
the two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as
a usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the
plea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's
feelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his
shaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the
room across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to
himself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo
interspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather
uncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.""My last girl--" and
began at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from
Vassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of
the higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her
that he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She's off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It's not exactly that
there's nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but
there's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's
got nothing else in her head."It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her," David explained."It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to
pieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking
into shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn't the answer to
Beulah's problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack
married a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,
temperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She
got going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her
at a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of
man's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're
thinking now of taking her to the--"

"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed
nothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven't
realized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I
am.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle
her some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself
seriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry
about," Peter persisted."Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's
got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its
most virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She's batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you'll see what we mean,
then.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his
face, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he
had an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to
see Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to
his friend.He had always felt that he saw
a little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the
energy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him
something alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her
soundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to
David."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see
Beulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to
try out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that
it's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell
the truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the
receiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the
ladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the
thin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of
his effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and
found him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided
that Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was
unthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid
vitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see
her."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and
tell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be
stopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I
never felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and
I think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world
they don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,
if I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,
what business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls
and bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if
my soul and body suffer?Peter
observed the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her
lips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don't think it was the original
intention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything
we are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can
understand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally
that and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long
enough--"

"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to
it.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to
get a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he
added aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she
conceded, "you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted
for so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and
I admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your
battle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you
personally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign
that's practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,
Peter,--"

"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are
concerned with.I know how much better church and state always have
been and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they
throw their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and
well for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and
Jimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her
state of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as
usual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical
incoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and
nobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren't we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right
to treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women
who are already in the proud possession of their rights and
privileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to
your theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in
two shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will
really begin," Beulah answered wearily."It's the habit of wearing the
yoke we'll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can't you give
yourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to
steady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but
nobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or
my failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,
that's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how
many people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't
believe in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position
of women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not
going to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like
so much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,
"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.""I shan't need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she'd stand
beside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and
have a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such
a child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?"I made a vow once that I would never
marry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there
are going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born
of the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn't make any difference why
you believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,
Peter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You
carry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my
way of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they're all wrong in
their treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a
less antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more
successful--"and I will.""You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or
who ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't
seem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's
necessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,
every one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and
opposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"
Peter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult
than he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and
substance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and
discounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the
interest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
the cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for
the struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of
balanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming
ourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health
and morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming
helpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously
responsible for Beulah's condition."She wouldn't have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had
been on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer
straighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be
stopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the
subject of equal guardianship,--and--"

Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the
depths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been
tensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You're the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they
stop me, I'll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don't cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You're too tired
to think things out now,--but I'll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of
the dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the
resemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when
she was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought
it all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it's wonderful that
you do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,
Beulah."Her arms closed around his neck and
tightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost
asleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his
tenderness."I didn't know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It
is the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not
sharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and
yellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung
in two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was
bent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her
confession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man
who had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX

MOSTLY UNCLE PETER


"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and
lonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole
year of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking
instead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone
any longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing
that it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much
troubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way
that it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have
grown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a
new woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that
you're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once
and for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and
never has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are
not hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be
married, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to
anybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and
you in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,
Uncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't
know.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written
you this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't
know quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by
when the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until
that happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find
some way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know
how to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not
belong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but
I don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it
already.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks
there is something different about her, but I think there are ways in
which I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly
what it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only
that, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I
think and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a
woman's soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,
is a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in
my life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I
think of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I
don't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing
it.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out
of this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up
troubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were
here to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the
gate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower
room all alone.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope
to Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven't any real right to
tell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without
saying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had
made her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet
spell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome
caress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She
understood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,
but that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle
David.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange
incredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her
lips."It's--it's--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from
somebody--else.Somebody that would make it
seem right."She felt that she
must get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any
man.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate
the way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand
"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the
realities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to
it--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had
bestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity
of her economic position; now that the complication of her relation
with David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly
uncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration
frightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or
troubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and
almost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow
accustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation
following the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but
David relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving
her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with
Mademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five
of her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,
she soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and
normal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and
when she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the
matter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the
group.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with
them.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting
for her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she
looked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very
newly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she
was soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *

"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good
many new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs
as if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and
teases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a
studio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle
Jimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking
into the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him
when we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at
me, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in
my school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we've dined at Sherry's, and one night we went down
to the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to
_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget
that night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing
me about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never
seem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about
taking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must
have telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he
would, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time
talks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very
little better than not seeing him at all.He isn't like himself,
someway.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand."*       *       *       *       *

"Don't you think that Uncle Peter has changed?"she asked Jimmie,
when the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand."He is a little pale about the ears," Jimmie conceded, "but I think
that's the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all
his spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and
getting out on his horse the way he used to.He's doing a good job on
the old dear, but it's some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--"

"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?"Eleanor's lips were dry,
but she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed
strange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs
that made her very heart stand still."I didn't know that Uncle Peter
had been taking care of her.""Taking care of her isn't a circumstance to what Peter has been doing
for Beulah.You know she hasn't been right for some time.She got
burning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when
there was air in it.""Uncle David thought so the last time I was here," Eleanor said, "but
I didn't know that Uncle Peter--"

"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got
alarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that
Doctor Gramercy was called.If we'd believed he would go into it quite
so heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It's
very nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when
the lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah's
got suffrage mania, and Peter's got Beulah mania, and it's a merry
mess all around."You haven't seen much of him since you came, have
you?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get
away from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked 'Votes for
Women,' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green
perambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks
to her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only
subject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo
gently under it day by day.It's a very complicated process but he's
making headway.""I'm glad of that," Eleanor said faintly."How--how is Aunt Gertrude?I don't see her very often, either."It was Jimmie's turn to look self-conscious."She never has time for me any more; I'm not high-brow enough for her.She's getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere."She gave me a cast of her faun's head."She is, I guess, but don't let's waste all our valuable time talking
about the family.Let's talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I'm
feeling and then I'll tell you.Then I'll ask you how you're feeling
and you'll tell me.Then I'll tell you how I imagine you must be
feeling from the way you're looking,--and that will give me a chance
to expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I'll work up
delicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably
with all the other nice young men you know,--and then we'll be off."Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little."We shall indeed," he assured her solemnly.No, on second
thoughts, I'll begin.I'll begin at the place where I start telling
you how excessively well you're looking.I don't know, considering its
source, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest
blue eyes that I've, ever seen in all my life,--and I'm rather a judge
of them.""All the better to eat you with, my dear," Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows."I don't feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a
funny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn't
it?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn't blither to the very
babe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?""I'm not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says
that you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering
things out of your previous experience.""'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?'"Only I'd prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if
it's all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, 'yet
not for a--' something or other 'would I wish undone that deed beyond
the grave.'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could
understand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let's get out
into the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this
afternoon.I wish you hadn't grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my
breath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath
taken away so suddint like.Let's get out into the rolling prairie of
Central Park."But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that
peculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The
children, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks
later would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless
between seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive
balminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating
chilliness."I'm sorry I'm not more entertaining this afternoon," Jimmie
apologized on the way home."It isn't that I am not happy, or that I
don't feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I'm
silent upon a peak in Darien,--that's all.""I was thinking of something else, too," Eleanor said."I didn't say I was thinking of something else.""People are always thinking of something else when they aren't talking
to each other, aren't they?""Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn't thinking of
something else, I was thinking--well, I won't tell you exactly--at
present."A penny is a good deal of money."I'm afraid I couldn't--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle
Jimmie."My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other
hand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.""I'm afraid they wouldn't be worth anything to anybody.""You simply don't know what I am capable of making out of them.""I wish I could make something out of them," Eleanor said so
miserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her
out, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *

"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt
Beulah," she wrote in her diary that evening."It is beautiful of him
to try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just
like him, but I don't understand why it is that he doesn't come and
tell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to
know that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even
in helping her.It isn't like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and
nurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might
think that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on
my heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn't it occur to him that I might have something to
tell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to
keep in form.If he doesn't have a certain amount of muscular
activity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases
between his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked
him the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head
ached, and he said 'no,' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost
all the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter
is trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to
him, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody
in the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter."I suppose it's a part of his great beauty that he should think so
disparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just
how dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn't so much what
he says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,
it's the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn't think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn't know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon
somebody who isn't as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it
makes me wild to think of it.My
vacation is almost over, and I don't see how I could bear going back
to school without one comforting hour of him alone."I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about
Uncle Peter!"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are
going to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to
try to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won't give
me the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can't
have, and things you can have and don't want.It seems almost disloyal
to put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love
him, but oh!--not in that way.There is only one
person in a woman's life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn't my Uncle Peter come to me?"CHAPTER XX

THE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING


"Just by way of formality," David said, "and not because I think any
one present"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner
table--"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be
released from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years
ago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I
do wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission
granted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do
so."Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine
confusion that it raised a shout of laughter."I never signed any pledge to that effect.""We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital
celibate anyway," Jimmie answered."Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me," Peter
said with a covert glance at Beulah."I wish I could say as much," Jimmie sighed, "since this is the hour
of confession I don't mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon."Gertrude clapped her hands softly."We've the makings of a triple
wedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear
the voice that breathed o'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the
most exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to
the health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one
slipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret's sudden pallor and heard the convulsive
catching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,
pale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the
shadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own
salvation."On behalf of my coadjutors," he said, "I thank you.All this is
extremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the
other gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully
into my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is
that I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of
abstinence.You fellows say something," he concluded,
sinking abruptly into his chair."Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian," Jimmie murmured."I've got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say
and that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I'll
create a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link
her name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our
leading journals, you'll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to
create with my modest announcement.I've got a real romance up my
sleeve."There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.""The lady won't give me her permission to speak," Peter said."She
knows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.""It is better we should marry," she said."I didn't realize that when
I exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that
the brains to carry on the great work of the world must be
inherited."I'll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider
ourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as
a further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.""Eleanor will be surprised, won't she?"Three
self-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation."_Eleanor_," Margaret breathed, "_Eleanor_.""I rather think she will," Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David
said nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still
twirling on its stem."Eleanor will be taken care of just the same," Beulah said decisively."I don't think we need even go through the formality of a vote on
that.""Eleanor will be taken care of," David said softly.The Hutchinsons' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor
nowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other
girls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were
disappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude
respectively under their accustomed protection."I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude," Jimmie said reproachfully as she
slipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm."I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret," David said;
"you never gave me the slip before.""The old order changeth," Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as
she preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior."It's Eleanor," Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth
Avenue."Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn't you
see their faces when Beulah spoke of her?""David wants to marry Eleanor," Margaret said quietly."I've known it
all winter--without realizing what it was I knew.""Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?""Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?"it doesn't make any difference,--we're losing them just the same.""No matter what combinations come
about, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.""Indestructible friendship--shucks," Gertrude cried."The boys are
going to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that
indestructible friendships don't survive--except as ghosts.""It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor," Margaret said."It's Peter who has always loved her best."As a friend," Beulah said, "as her dearest friend.""Not as a friend," Margaret answered softly, "she loves him."I believe it," Gertrude said.Of
course, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.""If it isn't we've succeeded in working out a rather tragic
experiment," Margaret said, "haven't we?""Life is a tragic experiment for any woman," Gertrude said
sententiously."Peter doesn't intend to marry Eleanor," Beulah persisted."Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?""Yes, I do know, but I--I can't tell you yet.""Whoever it is, it's a mistake," Margaret said."It's our little
Eleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn't realize it himself yet, and
when he does it will be too late.He's probably gone and tied himself
up with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn't he, Beulah?""I don't know," Beulah said; "perhaps he has.I hadn't thought of it
that way.""It's the way to think of it, I know."Margaret's eyes filled with
sudden tears."But whatever he's done it's past mending now.There'll
be no question of Peter's backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and
our poor little kiddie's got to suffer.""Beulah took it hard," Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town
again after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were
spending the night together at Margaret's.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically
responsible for her.I can't pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are
our boys going to marry?""I don't know, Gertrude.""I always thought that you and David--"

Margaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit
question."I always thought that you and Jimmie--" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him."it's all over now," Gertrude said, "but I didn't know that a
living soul suspected me."Gertrude whispered as they clung to each
other.I've never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so
used to him.""That's the rub," Gertrude said, "we're so used to them.They're
so--so preposterously necessary to us."Late that night clasped in each other's arms they admitted the extent
of their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The
solid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the
background of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,
so many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of
their circle was an unthinkable calamity."We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,"
Gertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly
turned in the right direction instead of being given their heads."I wouldn't pay that price for love," Margaret said.By
the time I had made it happen I wouldn't want it.""That's my trouble too," Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her
pillow and sobbed helplessly."Jimmie had such ducky little curls,"
she explained incoherently."I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude's breath began
to rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the
darkness.CHAPTER XXI

ELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in
which to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got
to write.In the first place I can't believe that the things you said
to me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of
realities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that
you were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes
the woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same
way.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can't help
feeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you
said this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely
ways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream
things that we wouldn't even understand if we were thoroughly awake."In the second place, you can't want to marry your little niecelet,
the funny little 'kiddo,' that used to burn her fingers and the
beefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of
make-believe together.That's what our association always ought to
mean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn't think of myself being married to you any more than I could
Jack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.You're my truly best and
dearest childhood's playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle
Jimmie.I don't think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless
she has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn't want to
marry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of
playmates that can't marry each other.I think that you and I are that
kind, Uncle Jimmie."My dear, my dear, don't let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when
I am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped
support and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so
much,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this
distorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong
enough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find
the way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are
feeling now is not real.I can't tell you how I know, but I do know
the difference.They could be pulled up
without too terrible a havoc."Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a
hard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor
inkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny
little Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope
you will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other
lumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth
considering except as a kind of human joke."Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *

It was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret
spending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which
Eleanor's school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her
overnight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the
entire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her
for the revelations that were in store for her, though she was
ostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into
the Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in
the low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road
house, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new
sporting clothes."Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married," she
told her."No, I didn't," Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very
white.David gave a dinner party one night last
week in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don't know
the name of the lady yet, and we can't guess it.He says it is not a
society girl.""Who do you think it is, Eleanor?""I--I can't think, Aunt Margaret.""We don't know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely
insinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we
knew.""Perhaps he has changed his mind by now," Eleanor said.Don't you think it might be that they both just
thought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to
marry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don't think it's a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had
anticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the
sensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to
tell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from
the pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have
been shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were
connecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity
nightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in
Margaret's memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell
her in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not
so perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely
thing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now
that I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my
feelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people
I've grown, Eleanor?""You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're
very much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything
about Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant."I haven't heard from him for a
long time.""Yes, he's well," Margaret said."He's looking better than he was for
a while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He
said that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It's Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of
her.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don't think it's Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,
but I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if
she hadn't been.""Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn't know that," she said.She
pushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don't touch me," she cried, "I can't bear it.You might not want
to--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw
her head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *

The next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in
the night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from
the room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of
exhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk
said, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to
do things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that
some people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,
and I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to
tell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found
to be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such
beautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each
other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little
blinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt
Margaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go
wrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be
that kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one
else know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,
don't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange
it so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me
naturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the
river, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be
any use in trying to find me.I couldn't
ever bear seeing one of your faces again.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him
to know,--I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I
have taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII

THE SEARCH


Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,
but the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him
and told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a
lank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his
attitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure
made Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to
proceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the
school, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a
somewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a
promise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not
keep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the
others.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor
had left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,
they faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was
hurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"
Margaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her
going.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to
marry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,"
David said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I
told her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think
that she's probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of
judgment, Margaret?I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to
either one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that
same afternoon at Beulah's apartment."I'll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting
explanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done
their best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he
only said, "I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we
try we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it's going to be so easy?"She's a pretty determined little person when she
makes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously."I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world," Peter said."I'll find
her and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she
went away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else
on her mind, hadn't she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but
she had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we
haven't told any one."It's
just one of God's most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don't believe in shifting
responsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been
instrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her
to my own happiness.""It isn't so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start
going soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has
been directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for
that matter.""Don't worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the
other corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You
mustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but
we'll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you'll get her
back again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *

Peter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding
out the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly
to her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine
office, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt
almost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the defraying of her college
expenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even
though she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this
theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."The hobby-horse idea also was
sure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.[32]

But apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the
foreign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is
genuine and original: the author’s German patriotism, his praise of the
old days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled “Die Gaststube,” his
“Trinklied eines Deutschen,” his disquisition on the position of the
poet in the world (“ein eignes Kapitel”), and his adulation of Gellert
at the latter’s grave.The reviewer in the _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_[33] chides the unnamed, youthful author for not
allowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for being led on
by Jacobi’s success to hasten his exercises into print.In reality Bock
was no longer youthful (forty-six) when the “Tagereise” was published.The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_ for 1771, calls the book “an
unsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,” and wishes that this
“Rhapsodie von Cruditäten” might be the last one thrust on the market as
a “Sentimental Journey.” The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[34]
comments also on the double inspiration, and the insufficiency and
tiresomeness of the performance.And yet Boie[35] says the papers
praised the little book; for himself, however, he observes, he little
desires to read it, and adds “What will our Yoricks yet come to?At last
they will get pretty insignificant, I think, if they keep on this way.”

Bock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the
early seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1) Empfindsame
Reise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick
angestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771--really published at the end of
the previous year; (2) . . .am Ostertage, 1772; (3) Am Pfingsttage,
1772; (4) Am Johannistage, 1773; (5) Am Weynachtstage, 1773.These books
were issued anonymously, and Schröder’s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3)
under Bock’s name, but there seems no good reason to doubt his
authorship of them all.Indeed, his claim to (1) is, according to the
_Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the
“Tagereise” in the introduction, and by the initials signed.None of
them are given by Goedeke.The books are evidently only in a general way
dependent on the Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all
sorts of subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some
relation to the festival in which they appear.In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that the
title only is derived from Yorick,[36] and states that he was forced to
this misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but
“Empfindsame Reisen.” It is also to be noted that the description
beneath the title, “von einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,” is omitted
after the first volume.The review of (4) and (5) in the _Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter_ finds this a commendable resumption of proper
humility.The observations are evidently loosely strung together without
the pretense of a narrative, such as “Allgemeines Perspectiv durch alle
Visitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines
Weisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschlüsse, Empfindsame Art sein
Geld gut unterzubringen,” etc.[37] An obvious purpose inspires the
writer, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the meditations
are distinctly religious.That some of the observations had a local
significance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental tendency
there, may account for the warm reception by the _Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent_.[38]

Some contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias Claudius
and Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of mental
and emotional fibre is suggested.No one claimed an influence working
from the English master.Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm Röseler in his
introductory poem to a study of “Matthias Claudius und sein Humor”[39]
calls Asmus, “Deutschland’s Yorick,” thereby agreeing almost verbally
with the German correspondent of the _Deutsches Museum_, who wrote from
London nearly a hundred years before, September 14, 1778, “Asmus.is the German Sterne,” an assertion which was denied by a later
correspondent, who asserts that Claudius’s manner is very different from
that of Sterne.[40]

August von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on
Sterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, “Die Geschichte
meines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.”[41] The
influence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story:
he commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and
grandmother, and the circumstances of his father’s birth.The
grandfather is an original undoubtedly modeled on lines suggested by
Sterne’s hobby-horse idea.He had been chosen in days gone by to greet
the reigning prince on the latter’s return from a journey, and the old
man harks back to this circumstance with “hobby-horsical” persistence,
whatever the subject of conversation, even as all matters led Uncle Toby
to military fortification, and the elder Shandy to one of his pet
theories.In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed.When the
news comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man
discuss multifarious and irrelevant topics in a fashion reminiscent of
the conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while similar events
are going on above.Later in the book we have long lists, or catalogues
of things which resemble one of Sterne’s favorite mannerisms.But the
greater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far removed from its
inception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a gallery of
originals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.Göschen’s “Reise von Johann”[42] is a product of the late renascence of
sentimental journeying.Master and servant are represented in this book
as traveling through southern Germany, a pair as closely related in head
and heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain Shandy and Corporal Trim.The style is of rather forced buoyancy and sprightliness, with
intentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt at humor of
narration, which is choked by characteristic national desire to convey
information, and a fatal propensity to description of places,[43] even
when some satirical purpose underlies the account, as in the description
of Erlangen and its university.The servant Johann has mild adventures
with the maids in the various inns, which are reminiscent of Yorick,
and in one case it borders on the openly suggestive and more Shandean
method.[44] A distinctly borrowed motif is the accidental finding of
papers which contain matters of interest.This is twice resorted to;
a former occupant of the room in the inn in Nürnberg had left valuable
notes of travel; and Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on
self-destruction, takes from her a box with papers, disclosing a
revolting story, baldly told.German mediocrity, imitating Yorick in
this regard, and failing of his delicacy and subtlety, brought forth
hideous offspring.An attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in
the “Furth Catechismus in Frage und Antwort” (pp.71-74), and genuinely
sentimental adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp.70-71)
and the village funeral (pp.This book is classed by Ebeling[45] without sufficient reason as an
imitation of von Thümmel.This statement is probably derived from the
letter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following
lines.Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,
December 29, 1795.[46] The abundance of material for the Xenien project
is commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list of
vulnerable possibilities we read: “Thümmel, Göschen als sein
Stallmeister--” a collocation of names easily attributable, in
consideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature
of their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author
on another,[47] or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the fact
that Göschen was von Thümmel’s publisher.Nor is there anything in the
correspondence to justify Ebeling’s harshness in saying concerning this
volume of Göschen, that it “enjoyed the honor of being ridiculed
(verhöhnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.”
Goethe replies (December 30), in approval, and exclaims, “How fine
Charis and Johann will appear beside one another.”[48] The suggestion
concerning a possible use of Göschen’s book in the Xenien was never
carried out.It will be remembered that Göschen submitted the manuscript of his book
to Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement
“that he had laughed heartily at some of the whims.[49]” Garve, in a
letter dated March 8, 1875, speaks of Göschen’s book in terms of
moderate praise.[50]

The “Empfindsame Reise von Oldenburg nach Bremen,”[51] the author of
which was a Hanoverian army officer, H. J. C. Hedemann, is characterized
by Ebeling as emphatically not inspired by Sterne.[52] Although it is
not a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and Bock conceived it,
and is thus not an example of the earliest period of imitation, and
although it contains no passages of teary sentimentality in attitude
toward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all connection with
Sterne’s manner.It would seem as if, having outgrown the earlier
Yorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human brotherhood,
perhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution, certain would-be
men of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as through a glass
darkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in lumbering,
Teutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of sentimentalism, and
to build success for their wares on remembrance of a defaced idol.This
view of later sentimental journeying is practically acknowledged at any
rate in a contemporary review, the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ for
August 22, 1796, which remarks: “A sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet,
wo einige bekannte Sachen und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz
heben sollen.”[53]

Hedemann’s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is
openly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.His endeavor is markedly in Sterne’s manner in his attitude toward the
writing of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing
the material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the
various parts of the book.Quite in Sterne’s fashion, and to be
associated with Sterne’s frequent promises of chapters, and statements
concerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination “to
mention some things beforehand about which I don’t know anything to
say,” and his rather humorous enumeration of them.The author satirizes
the real sentimental traveler of Sterne’s earlier imitators in the
following passage (second chapter):

“It really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,
if no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is
surely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be
managed with strict economy.If one leaps over the most interesting
events entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at
least of not filling many pages.”

Likewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the
satirical purpose is evident.He has not gone far on his journey when he
is met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines
that there is a “Schlagbaum” in the way.After the children have opened
the barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little
coin, concludes, as a “sentimental traveler,” to give it to the other
sex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct.He
reflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,--all of
which is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to trivial
acts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past conduct,
which was copied by Sterne’s imitators from numerous instances in the
works of Yorick.Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in which
he beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a paper
throne; and of particular significance here is the explanation that the
whole company who do “erhabene Dummheit” honor formerly lived in cities
of the kingdom, but “now they are on journeys.” Further examples of a
humorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it would be a
“great error” to write an account of a journey without weaving in an
anecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all duties of such
a traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to accomplish it, and his
formal declaration: “I, the undersigned, do vow and make promise to be
in love before twenty-four hours are past.” The story with which his
volume closes, “Das Ständchen,” is rather entertaining and is told
graphically, easily, without whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian
_double entendre_.[54]

Another work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning
shade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole
remaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the
“Empfindsame Reise nach Schilda” (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo.von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_
(1794, I, p.416) as a free revision of an old popular tale, “Das
lustige und lächerliche Lalenburg.” The book is evidently without
sentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and joke combined with
caricature and half-serious tilting against unimportant literary
celebrities.[55]

Certain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously connected
with Sterne may be grouped together here.To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous product,
“Zween Tage eines Schwindsüchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,” von L. . . .(Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the sentiment is “not
entirely like Yorick’s,” and the _Altonaer Reichs-Postreuter_ (July 2,
1772) adds that “not at all like Yorick’s” would have been nearer the
truth.This book is mentioned by Hillebrand with implication that it is
the extreme example of the absurd sentimental tendency, probably judging
merely from the title,[56] for the book is doubtless merely thoughtful,
contemplative, with a minimum of overwrought feeling.According to the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (1775, pp.592-3),
another product of the earlier seventies, the “Leben und Schicksale des
Martin Dickius,” by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many places a clever
imitation of Sterne,[57] although the author claims, like Wezel in
“Tobias Knaut,” not to have read Shandy until after the book was
written.Surely the digression on noses which the author allows himself
is suspicious.Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which reference
has been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent criticism as
an imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel “Beyträge zur Geschichte
des teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,”[58] although the general
tenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance, seemed to promise a
more independent, a more competent and felicitous performance.Kurz
expresses this opinion, which may have been derived from criticisms in
the eighteenth century journals.The _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,
July 28, 1775, does not, however, take this view; but seems to be in the
novel a genuine exemplification of the author’s theories as previously
expressed.[59] The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[60] calls the book
didactic, a tract against certain essentially German follies.Merck, in
the _Teutscher Merkur_,[61] says the imitation of Sterne is quite too
obvious, though Blankenburg denies it.Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,
belongs undoubtedly “Die Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont” (1773),
the author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was
translated or Jacobi published.He says he is not worthy to pack
Yorick’s bag or weave Jacobi’s arbor,[62] but the review of the
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ evidently regards it as a product,
nevertheless, of Yorick’s impulse.Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau
la Roche[63] says that the “Empfindsamkeit” of Rosalie in the first part
of “Rosaliens Briefe” is derived from Yorick.The “Leben, Thaten und
Meynungen des D. J. Pet.Menadie” (Halle, 1777-1781) is charged by the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ with attempt at Shandy-like
eccentricity of narrative and love of digression.[64]

One little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick’s spell, is worthy
of particular mention because at its time it received from the reviewers
a more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file of
Sentimental Journeys.It is “M . . ..” by E. A. A. von Göchhausen
(1740-1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed
worthy of several later editions.Its dependence on Sterne is confessed
and obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes
defiantly.The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both
in outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness
dwindles away steadily as the book advances.Göchhausen, as other
imitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously
now and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to
say, a message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to
follow his model.The absurd title stands, of course, for “Meine Reisen” and the puerile
abbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were intended to be
a Sterne-like jest, a pitiful one.Why Goedeke should suggest “Meine
Randglossen” is quite inexplicable, since Göchhausen himself in the very
first chapter indicates the real title.Beneath the enigmatical title
stands an alleged quotation from Shandy: “Ein Autor borgt, bettelt und
stiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey meiner Seele!die Originalität
fast so rar geworden ist als die Ehrlichkeit.”[65] The book itself, like
Sterne’s Journey, is divided into brief chapters unnumbered but named.As the author loses Yorick from sight, the chapters grow longer.Göchhausen has availed himself of an odd device to disarm
criticism,--a plan used once or twice by Schummel: occasionally when the
imitation is obvious, he repudiates the charge sarcastically, or
anticipates with irony the critics’ censure.For example, he gives
directions to his servant Pumper to pack for the journey; a reader
exclaims, “a portmanteau, Mr.Author, so that everything, even to that,
shall be just like Yorick,” and in the following passage the author
quarrels with the critics who allow no one to travel with a portmanteau,
because an English clergyman traveled with one.Pumper’s
misunderstanding of this objection is used as a farther ridicule of the
critics.When on the journey, the author converses with two poor
wandering monks, whose conversation, at any rate, is a witness to their
content, the whole being a legacy of the Lorenzo episode, and the author
entitles the chapter: “The members of the religious order, or, as some
critics will call it, a wretchedly unsuccessful imitation.” In the next
chapter, “Der Visitator” (pp.in which the author encounters
customs annoyances, the critic is again allowed to complain that
everything is stolen from Yorick, a protest which is answered by the
author quite naïvely, “Yorick journeyed, ate, drank; I do too.” In “Die
Pause” the author stands before the inn door and fancies that a number
of spies (Ausspäher) stand there waiting for him; he protests that
Yorick encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a very different
sort of folk.On page 253 he exclaims, “für diesen schreibe ich dieses
Kapitel nicht und ich--beklage ihn!” Here a footnote suggests “Das
übrige des Diebstahls vid.Yorick’s Gefangenen.” Similarly when he calls
his servant his “La Fleur,” he converses with the critics about his
theft from Yorick.The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about the
name of the book.The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the motto, is
clinched by reference to this quotation in the section “Apologie,” and
by the following chapter, which is entitled “Yorick.” The latter is the
most unequivocal and, withal, the most successful imitation of Yorick’s
manner which the volume offers.The author is sitting on a sofa reading
the Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such a trip is awakened in him.Someone knocks and the door is opened by the postman, as the narrator is
opening his “Lorenzodose,” and the story of the poor monk is touching
his heart now for the twentieth time as strongly as ever.The postman
asks postage on the letter as well as his own trivial fee.The author
counts over money, miscounts it, then in counting forgets all about it,
puts the money away and continues the reading of Yorick.The postman
interrupts him; the author grows impatient and says, “You want four
groschen?” and is inexplicably vexed at the honesty of the man who says
it is only three pfennigs for himself and the four groschen for the
post.Here is a direct following of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules
his behavior toward an inferior, who is modest in his request.After the
incident, his spite, his head and his heart and his “ich” converse in
true Sterne fashion as to the advisability of his beginning to read
Yorick again.He reasons with himself concerning his conduct toward the
postman, then in an apostrophe to Yorick he condemns himself for failing
in this little test.This conversation occupies so much time that he
cannot run after the postman, but he resolves that nothing, not even the
fly that lights on his nose, shall bring him so far as to forget
wherefore his friend J . . . .sent him a “Lorenzodose.” And at the end
of the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,
disclosing the letters of the word “Yorick.” The “Lorenzodose” is
mentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by
opening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the
treasure.[66]

Following this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to “My dear
J . . .,” who, at the author’s request, had sent him on June 29th a
“Lorenzodose.” Jacobi’s accompanying words are given.The author
acknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the self-conquest
demanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been won.Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the volume
contains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment.The servant Pumper
is a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the dewdrops from
the blades of grass.Cast in the real Yorick mould is the scene in which
Pumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master’s expostulation that
God created the little beast also, Pumper is touched, wipes the blood
off with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness, indulging in a
pathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick’s ass episode.Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator’s conduct
toward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author asserts that
he has never eaten a roll, put on a white shirt, traveled in a
comfortable carriage, or been borne by a strong horse, without bemoaning
those who were less fortunately circumstanced.A similar and truly
Sterne-like triumph of feeling over convention is the traveler’s
insistence that Pumper shall ride with him inside the coach; seemingly a
point derived from Jacobi’s failure to be equally democratic.[67]

Sterne’s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially
his distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his
material is here imitated.For example: near the close of a chapter the
author summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title
“Der Brief” and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says
the latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced
in the following one.Yet with Yorick’s inconsequence, the narrator is
led aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, “But where is
Pumper?” with the answer, “Heaven and my readers know, it was to no
purpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last
one to which the title will be just as appropriate)”, and the next
chapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning “As to whether Pumper
will appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I am not really
sure myself.”

The whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the
author’s reasoning with him, a Sterne device, is employed so constantly
in the book as to become a wearying mannerism.Examples have already
been cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is devoted
to such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later the
reader objects to the narrator’s drinking coffee without giving a
chapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what
the chapter is going to be because of the author’s leap; the reader
guesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions
in the moon.The chapter “Der Einwurf” is occupied entirely with the
reader’s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of
fancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the
book; here the author discloses himself.[68] Sterne-like whim is found
in the chapter “Die Nacht,” which consists of a single sentence: “Ich
schenke Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig
verschlafen.” Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the
chapter entitled “Der Monolog,” which consists of four lines of dots,
and the question, “Didn’t you think all this too, my readers?”
Typographical eccentricity is observed also in the arrangement of the
conversation of the ladies A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter.Like Sterne, our author makes lists of things; probably inspired by
Yorick’s apostrophe to the “Sensorium” is our traveler’s appeal to the
spring of joy.The description of the fashion of walking observed in the
maid in the moon is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel’s
journey.Göchhausen’s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is
considerable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers;
his stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.The literary journals accepted Göchhausen’s work as a Yorick imitation,
condemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the book worthy
of their praise.[69]

Probably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure the
style of Tristram Shandy is Wezel’s once famous “Tobias Knaut,” the
“Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt,
aus Familiennachrichten gesammelt.”[70] In this work the influence of
Fielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne.The historians of
literature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of
the period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge
of human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.[71] They
unite also in the opinion that “Tobias Knaut” places Wezel in the ranks
of Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in
part the novel must be regarded as a satire on “Empfindsamkeit” and
hence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne’s
dominion, especially to the distinctively German Sterne.That this
impulse, which later became the guiding principle of “Wilhelmine Arend,”
was already strong in “Tobias Knaut” is hinted at by Gervinus, but
passed over in silence by other writers.Kurz, following Wieland, who
reviewed the novel in his _Merkur_, finds that the influence of Sterne
was baneful.Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as
obscuring and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents
of the author.[72]

A brief investigation of Wezel’s novel will easily demonstrate his
indebtedness to Sterne.Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the
charge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when “Tobias”
was begun.Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes
Tristram at some length.[73] This inconsistency is occasion for censure
on the part of the reviewers.Wezel’s story begins, like Shandy, “ab ovo,” and, in resemblance to
Sterne’s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child
before its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.The work is episodical and
digressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in
Sterne’s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the
personality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family
of originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne.This
is not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely
extraneous in event, and nature of interest.The story of the new-found
son, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for
its connection with the Knaut family is very remote.This very story,
interpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page
digression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the
author states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of
his “Lateinische Pneumatologie,”--a genuine Sternian pretense, reminding
one of the “Tristrapaedia.” Whimsicality of manner distinctly
reminiscent of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or
lists of things, as in Chapter III, “Deduktionen, Dissertationen,
Argumentationen a priori und a posteriori,” and so on; plainly adapted
from Sterne’s idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large
red letters occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of
the second volume, which reads as follows: “Dienst-freundliche Anzeige.Jedermann, der an ernsten Gesprächen keinen Gefallen findet, wird
freundschaftlich ersucht alle folgende Blätter, deren Inhalt einem
Gespräche ähnlich sieht, wohlbedächtig zu überschlagen, d.h.von dieser
Anzeige an gerechnet.Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich vom 22.Absatze fahren können,--Cuique Suum.” The following page is blank: this
is closely akin to Sterne’s vagaries.Like Sterne, he makes promise of
chapter-subject.[74] Similarly dependent on Sterne’s example, is the
Fragment in Chapter VIII, Volume III, which breaks off suddenly under
the plea that the rest could not be found.Like Sterne, our author
satirizes detailed description in the excessive account of the
infinitesimals of personal discomfort after a carouse.[75] He makes also
obscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by typographical eccentricities
(I, p. 153).To be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets
is the humor “Man leuterirte, appelirte--irte,--irte,--irte.”

The author’s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are
sketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,--for example, the
beginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the difficulties
of chronicling what has happened during the preceding learned
disquisition.When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse, this is
accompanied by the sighs of the author, a really audible one being put
in a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative style for which
Sterne must be held responsible.Similar to this is the author’s
statement (Chap.II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope, Wieland and
all the rest could not unite the characteristics which had just been
predicated of Selmann.Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the reader
about the way of telling the story, indulging[76] in a mock-serious line
of reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes.Further conversation
with the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in Volume I,
and in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, “Wake up, ladies and
gentlemen,” and continues at some length a conversation with these
fancied personages about the progress of the book.Wezel in a few cases
adopted the worst feature of Sterne’s work and was guilty of bad taste
in precisely Yorick’s style: Tobias’s adventure with the so-called
soldier’s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but
the following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in
the pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding.Sterne’s indecent
suggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the
Original’s aversion to women.A similar censure could be spoken
regarding the adventure in the tavern,[77] where the author hesitates on
the edge of grossness.Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the
accidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the
“Original,” left behind in the hotel, played their rôle in the tale.The treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an
imitation of Yorick’s famous visit in the rural cottage.A parallel to
Walter Shandy’s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles is
found in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance suggested
the sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias’s inability to take
off his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy’s future
life.This is a reminder of Tristram’s obliquity in his manner of
setting up his top.As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the
location of the soul.The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick
and the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to
chastise the thirst for “originals” and overwrought sentimentalism.His
generosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick.As a boy he
would empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life
was one round of Shandean speculation, largely about the relationships
of trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating his
motives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.Wezel’s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the
account of the “Original” (Chap.II), who was cold when
others were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was
not full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host
because it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a
woman.Selmann longs to meet such an original.Selmann also thinks he
has found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with
“Nein,” greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that
this was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage
over Selmann himself.So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias
ride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to
be merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental
friend.Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two
maidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and
write a lament over its demise.In jest, too, it is said that the
Captain made a “sentimental journey through the stables.” The author
converses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,
a convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal.The novelist
makes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed making a
long citation from a learned Chinese book.An expression suggesting
Sterne is the oath taken “bey den Nachthemden aller Musen,”[78] and an
intentional inconsequence of narration, giving occasion to conversation
regarding the author’s control of his work, is the sudden passing over
of the six years which Tobias spent in Selmann’s house.[79]

In connection with Wezel’s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products in
Germany, it is interesting to consider his poem: “Die unvermuthete
Nachbarschaft.Ein Gespräch,” which was the second in a volume of three
poems entitled “Epistel an die deutschen Dichter,” the name of the first
poem, and published in Leipzig in 1775.This slight work is written for
the most part in couplets and covers twenty-three pages.Wezel
represents Doktor Young, the author of the gloomy “Night Thoughts” and
“Der gute Lacher,--Lorenz Sterne” as occupying positions side by side in
his book-case.This proximity gives rise to a conversation between the
two antipodal British authors: Sterne says:

  “Wir brauchen beide vielen Raum,
  Your Reverence viel zum Händeringen,
  Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.”

and later,

 .“Und will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;
  Jüngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die
  Narrheit mich beym Rocke.Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,--Du!Du lachtest dich gesund.”

To Sterne’s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young
naturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life’s
evanescence and joy’s certain blight.But Sterne, though acknowledging
the transitoriness of life’s pleasures, denies Young’s deductions.Yorick’s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young’s picture and
one must admit that it has no justification in Sterne’s writings.On the
contrary, Yorick’s life was one long flight from the grim enemy.The
idea of death cherished by Asmus in his “Freund Hein,” the welcome
guest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne.Death
comes to Yorick in full dress, a youth, a Mercury:

  “Er thuts, er kommt zu mir, ‘Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!’
  So ruft er auf mich zu.‘Dein Haus fängt an zu wanken,
  Die Mauern spalten sich; Gewölb und Balken schwanken,
  Was nuzt dir so ein Haus?.’”

so he takes the wreathèd cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,
embracing him.“Das ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,
  Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schmückst,
  Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht’s in wenig Wochen,
  Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine Hände drückst?Ganz nach Bequemlichkeit!du bist mir zwar willkommen.”

The latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of the
part played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in Sterne’s
works only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a relation sometimes delicate
and clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the indelicate and sensual, is a
foregone conclusion.Undoubtedly some found in the general approbation
which was accorded Sterne’s books a sanction for forcing upon the public
the products of their own diseased imaginations.This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by
Wegener’s “Raritäten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des Küsters von
Rummelsberg.”[80] The first volume is dedicated to “Sebaldus Nothanker,”
and the long document claims for the author unusual distinction, in thus
foregoing the possibility of reward or favor, since he dedicates his
book to a fictitious personage.The idea of the book is to present
“merry observations” for every day in the year.With the end of the
fourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, the sixth volume includes May 22.The
present writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover whether
the year was rounded out in this way.The author claims to write “neither for surly Catos nor for those fond
of vulgar jests and smutty books,” but for those who will laugh.At the
close of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: “In
order to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne, I made
a decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly; indeed I
have burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of it with
warm English ale, but”--he had the insight and courtesy to add--“it
helped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps in the
footprints of one who can walk nimbly.” The very nature of this author’s
dependence on Sterne excludes here any extended analysis of the
connection.The style is abrupt, full of affected gaiety and raillery,
conversational and journalistic.The stories, observations and
reflections, in prose and verse, represent one and all the ribaldry of
Sterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for example, by the story of
the abbess of Andouillets, but without the charm and grace with which
that tale begins.The author copies Sterne in the tone of his
lucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.In the first
volume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne is the
introduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for January
11.The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes, present a
somewhat Sternesque appearance.These volumes are reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[81]
with full appreciation of their pernicious influence, and with open
acknowledgment that their success demonstrates a pervision of taste in
the fatherland.The author of the “Litterarische Reise durch
Deutschland”[82] advises his sister, to whom his letters are directed,
to put her handkerchief before her mouth at the very mention of Wegener,
and fears that the very name has befouled his pen.A similar
condemnation is meted out in Wieland’s _Merkur_.[83]

A similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a somewhat
similar collection of stories, “Der Geist der Romane im letzten Viertel
des 18ten Jahrhunderts,” Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which the
author (S. G.claims to follow the spirit of the period and
gives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin whitewash of
teary sentimentalism.The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his writings
in the German literary world of the century succeeding the era of his
great popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task.Such
references in books, letters and periodicals multiply beyond possibility
of systematic study.One might take the works[84] of Friedrich Matthison
as a case in point.He visits the grave of Musäus, even as Tristram
Shandy sought for the resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III,
p.312); as he travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would
have afforded Yorick’s “Empfindsamkeit” the finest material for an
Ash-Wednesday sermon (IV, p. 67).Sterne’s expressions are cited:
“Erdwasserball” for the earth (V, p.57), “Wo keine Pflanze, die da
nichts zu suchen hatte, eine bleibende Stäte fand” (V, p.302); two
farmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as “Nach dem Ideal Yoricks” (VI,
pp.He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets (VI,
64); he narrates (VIII, pp.203-4) an anecdote of Sterne which has just
been printed in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ (1769, p.Levade in Lausanne, who bore a striking resemblance to
Sterne (V, p.279), and refers to Yorick in other minor regards (VII,
158; VIII, pp.51, 77, and Briefe II, 76).Yet in spite of this evident
infatuation, Matthison’s account of his own travels cannot be classed as
an imitation of Yorick, but is purely objective, descriptive, without
search for humor or pathos, with no introduction of personalities save
friends and celebrities.Heinse alluded to Sterne frequently in his
letters to Gleim (1770-1771),[85] but after August 23, 1771, Sterne
vanished from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts
until 1802, a fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for
Sterne and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of
Yorick’s personal hold.Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and
duration of his popularity, may not be without interest: Kästner
“Vermischte Schriften,” II, p.134 (Steckenpferd); Lenz “Gesammelte
Werke,” Berlin, 1828, Vol.312; letter from the Duchess Amalie,
August 2, 1779, in “Briefe an und von Merck,” Darmstadt, 1838; letter of
Caroline Herder to Knebel, April 2, 1799, in “K. L.von Knebel’s
Literarischer Nachlass,” Leipzig, 1835, p.324 (Yorick’s “heiliges
Sensorium”); a rather unfavorable but apologetic criticism of Shandy in
the “Hinterlassene Schriften” of Charlotta Sophia Sidonia Seidelinn,
Nürnberg, 1793, p.227; “Schiller’s Briefe,” edited by Fritz Jonas, I,
pp.136, 239; in Hamann’s letters, “Leben und Schriften,” edited by Dr.C. H. Gildermeister, Gotha, 1875, II, p.16,
163; in C. L. Jünger’s “Anlage zu einem Familiengespräch über die
Physiognomik” in _Deutsches Museum_, II, pp.781-809, where the French
barber who proposes to dip Yorick’s wig in the sea is taken as a type of
exaggeration.And a similar reference is found in Wieland’s _Merkur_,
1799, I, p.15: Yorick’s Sensorium is again cited, _Merkur_, 1791, II,
p. 95.Other references in the _Merkur_ are: 1774, III, p.52; 1791, I,
p.19-21; _Deutsches Museum_, IV, pp.66, 462; _Neuer Gelehrter Mercurius_, Altona, 1773, August 19, in review
of Goethe’s “Götz;” _Almanach der deutschen Musen_, 1771, p. 93.And
thus the references scatter themselves down the decades.“Das Wörtlein
Und,” by F. A. Krummacher (Duisberg und Essen, 1811), bore a motto taken
from the Koran, and contained the story of Uncle Toby and the fly with a
personal application, and Yorick’s division of travelers is copied
bodily and applied to critics.Friedrich Hebbel, probably in 1828, gave
his Newfoundland dog the name of Yorick-Sterne-Monarch.[86] Yorick is
familiarly mentioned in Wilhelm Raabe’s “Chronik der Sperlingsgasse”
(1857), and in Ernst von Wolzogen’s “Der Dornenweg,” two characters
address one another in Yorick similes.Indeed, in the summer of 1902,
a Berlin newspaper was publishing “Eine Empfindsame Reise in einem
Automobile.”[87]

Musäus is named as an imitator of Sterne by Koberstein, and Erich
Schmidt implies in his “Richardson, Rousseau und Goethe,” that he
followed Sterne in his “Grandison der Zweite,” which could hardly be
possible, for “Grandison der Zweite” was first published in 1760, and
was probably written during 1759, that is, before Sterne had published
Tristram Shandy.Adolph von Knigge is also mentioned by Koberstein as a
follower of Sterne, and Baker includes Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” and “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” in his list.Their connection with Sterne cannot be designated as other than remote;
the former is a merry vagabond story, reminding one much more of the
tavern and way-faring adventures in Fielding and Smollett, and
suggesting Sterne only in the constant conversation with the reader
about the progress of the book and the mechanism of its construction.One example of the hobby-horse idea in this narration may perhaps be
traced to Sterne.The “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” has even
less connection; it shares only in the increase of interest in personal
accounts of travel.Knigge’s novels, “Peter Claus” and “Der Roman meines
Lebens,” are decidedly not imitations of Sterne; a clue to the character
of the former may be obtained from the fact that it was translated into
English as “The German Gil Blas.” “Der Roman meines Lebens” is a typical
eighteenth century love-story written in letters, with numerous
characters, various intrigues and unexpected adventures; indeed, a part
of the plot, involving the abduction of one of the characters, reminds
one of “Clarissa Harlowe.” Sterne is, however, incidentally mentioned in
both books, is quoted in “Peter Claus” (Chapter VI, Vol.II), and Walter
Shandy’s theory of Christian names is cited in “Der Roman meines
Lebens.”[88] That Knigge had no sympathy with exaggerated sentimentalism
is seen in a passage in his “Umgang mit Menschen.”[89] Knigge admired
and appreciated the real Sterne and speaks in his “Ueber Schriftsteller
und Schriftstellerei”[90] of Yorick’s sharpening observation regarding
the little but yet important traits of character.Moritz August von Thümmel in his famous “Reise in die mittäglichen
Provinzen von Frankreich” adopted Sterne’s general idea of sentimental
journeying, shorn largely of the capriciousness and whimsicality which
marked Sterne’s pilgrimage.He followed Sterne also in driving the
sensuous to the borderland of the sensual.Hippel’s novels, “Lebensläufe nach aufsteigender Linie” and “Kreuz und
Querzüge des Ritters A. bis Z.” were purely Shandean products in which a
humor unmistakably imitated from Sterne struggles rather unsuccessfully
with pedagogical seriousness.Jean Paul was undoubtedly indebted to
Sterne for a part of his literary equipment, and his works afford proof
both of his occupation with Sterne’s writings and its effect upon his
own.A study of Hippel’s “Lebensläufe” in connection with both Sterne
and Jean Paul was suggested but a few years after Hippel’s death by a
reviewer in the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[91] as a
fruitful topic for investigation.A detailed, minute study of von
Thümmel, Hippel and Jean Paul[92] in connection with the English master
is purposed as a continuation of the present essay.Heine’s pictures of
travel, too, have something of Sterne in them.[Footnote 1: _Quellen und Forschungen_, II, p. 27.][Footnote 2: Jacobi remarked, in his preface to the “Winterreise”
    in the edition of 1807, that this section, “Der Taubenschlag” is
    not to be reckoned as bearing the trace of the then condemned
    “Empfindeley,” for many authors, ancient and modern, have taken up
    the cause of animals against man; yet Sterne is probably the
    source of Jacobi’s expression of his feeling.][Footnote 3: XI, 2, pp.[Footnote 4: For reviews of the “Sommerreise” see _Allg.deutsche

    with the previous one, and the two added volumes were those of
    Stevenson’s continuation.Longo calls Sterne’s Eliza “Elisha”
    (p.28) and Tristram’s father becomes Sir Walter Shandy (p.37),
    an unwarranted exaltation of the retired merchant.][Footnote 6: Review in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gel.Sachen_]

OPPOSITION TO STERNE AND HIS TYPE OF SENTIMENTALISM


Sterne’s influence in Germany lived its own life, and gradually and
imperceptibly died out of letters, as an actuating principle.Yet its
dominion was not achieved without some measure of opposition.The
sweeping condemnation which the soberer critics heaped upon the
incapacities of his imitators has been exemplified in the accounts
already given of Schummel, Bock and others.It would be interesting to
follow a little more closely this current of antagonism.The tone of
protest was largely directed, the edge of satire was chiefly whetted,
against the misunderstanding adaptation of Yorick’s ways of thinking and
writing, and only here and there were voices raised to detract in any
way from the genius of Sterne.He never suffered in Germany such an
eclipse of fame as was his fate in England.He was to the end of the
chapter a recognized prophet, an uplifter and leader.The far-seeing,
clear-minded critics, as Lessing, Goethe and Herder, expressed
themselves quite unequivocally in this regard, and there was later no
withdrawal of former appreciation.Indeed, Goethe’s significant words
already quoted came from the last years of his life, when the new
century had learned to smile almost incredulously at the relation of a
bygone folly.In the very heyday of Sterne’s popularity, 1772, a critic of Wieland’s
“Diogenes” in the _Auserlesene Bibliothek der neuesten deutschen
Litteratur_[1] bewails Wieland’s imitation of Yorick, whom the critic
deems a far inferior writer, “Sterne, whose works will disappear, while
Wieland’s masterpieces are still the pleasure of latest posterity.” This
review of “Diogenes” is, perhaps, rather more an exaggerated compliment
to Wieland than a studied blow at Sterne, and this thought is recognized
by the reviewer in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,[2] who
designates the compliment as “dubious” and “insulting,” especially in
view of Wieland’s own personal esteem for Sterne.Yet these words, even
as a relative depreciation of Sterne during the period of his most
universal popularity, are not insignificant.Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
a tutor at Saarbrücken, in 1770, records that one member of a reading
club which he had founded “regarded his taste as insulted because I sent
him “Yorick’s Empfindsame Reise.”[3] But Wagner regarded this instance
as a proof of Saarbrücken ignorance, stupidity and lack of taste; hence
the incident is but a wavering testimony when one seeks to determine the
amount and nature of opposition to Yorick.We find another derogatory fling at Sterne himself and a regret at the
extent of his influence in an anonymous book entitled “Betrachtungen
über die englischen Dichter,”[4] published at the end of the great
Yorick decade.The author compares Sterne most unfavorably with Addison:
“If the humor of the _Spectator_ and _Tatler_ be set off against the
digressive whimsicality of Sterne,” he says, “it is, as if one of the
Graces stood beside a Bacchante.And yet the pampered taste of the
present day takes more pleasure in a Yorick than in an Addison.” But a
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5] discounts this
author’s criticisms of men of established fame, such as Shakespeare,
Swift, Yorick, and suggests youth, or brief acquaintance with English
literature, as occasion for his inadequate judgments.Indeed, Yorick
disciples were quick to resent any shadow cast upon his name.Thus the
remark in a letter printed in the _Deutsches Museum_ that Asmus was the
German Yorick “only a better moral character,” called forth a long
article in the same periodical for September, 1779, by L. H. N.,[6]
vigorously defending Sterne as a man and a writer.The greatness of his
human heart and the breadth and depth of his sympathies are given as the
unanswerable proofs of his moral worth.This defense is vehemently
seconded in the same magazine by Joseph von Retzer.The one great opponent of the whole sentimental tendency, whose censure
of Sterne’s disciples involved also a denunciation of the master
himself, was the Göttingen professor, Georg Christopher Lichtenberg.[7]
In his inner nature Lichtenberg had much in common with Sterne and
Sterne’s imitators in Germany, with the whole ecstatic, eccentric
movement of the time.Julian Schmidt[8] says: “So much is sure, at any
rate, that the greatest adversary of the new literature was of one flesh
and blood with it.”[9] But his period of residence in England shortly
after Sterne’s death and his association then and afterwards with
Englishmen of eminence render his attitude toward Sterne in large
measure an English one, and make an idealization either of the man or of
his work impossible for him.The contradiction between the greatness of heart evinced in Sterne’s
novels and the narrow selfishness of the author himself is repeatedly
noted by Lichtenberg.His knowledge of Sterne’s character was derived
from acquaintance with many of Yorick’s intimate friends in London.In
“Beobachtungen über den Menschen,” he says: “I can’t help smiling when
the good souls who read Sterne with tears of rapture in their eyes fancy
that he is mirroring himself in his book.Sterne’s simplicity, his warm
heart, over-flowing with feeling, his soul, sympathizing with everything
good and noble, and all the other expressions, whatever they may be; and
the sigh ‘Alas, poor Yorick,’ which expresses everything at once--have
become proverbial among us Germans. . . .Yorick was a crawling
parasite, a flatterer of the great, an unendurable burr on the clothing
of those upon whom he had determined to sponge!”[10]

In “Timorus” he calls Sterne “ein scandalum Ecclesiae”;[11] he doubts
the reality of Sterne’s nobler emotions and condemns him as a clever
juggler with words, who by artful manipulation of certain devices
aroused in us sympathy, and he snatches away the mask of loving, hearty
sympathy and discloses the grinning mountebank.With keen insight into
Sterne’s mind and method, he lays down a law by which, he says, it is
always possible to discover whether the author of a touching passage has
really been moved himself, or has merely with astute knowledge of the
human heart drawn our tears by a sly choice of touching features.[12]

Akin to this is the following passage in which the author is
unquestionably thinking of Sterne, although he does not mention him:
“A heart ever full of kindly feeling is the greatest gift which Heaven
can bestow; on the other hand, the itching to keep scribbling about it,
and to fancy oneself great in this scribbling is one of the greatest
punishments which can be inflicted upon one who writes.”[13] He exposes
the heartlessness of Sterne’s pretended sympathy: “A three groschen
piece is ever better than a tear,”[14] and “sympathy is a poor kind of
alms-giving,”[15] are obviously thoughts suggested by Yorick’s
sentimentalism.[16]

The folly of the “Lorenzodosen” is several times mentioned with open or
covert ridicule[17] and the imitators of Sterne are repeatedly told the
fruitlessness of their endeavor and the absurdity of their
accomplishment.[18] His “Vorschlag zu einem Orbis Pictus für deutsche
dramatische Schriftsteller, Romanendichter und Schauspieler”[19] is a
satire on the lack of originality among those who boasted of it, and
sought to win attention through pure eccentricities.The Fragments[20] are concerned, as the editors say, with an evil of the
literature in those days, the period of the Sentimentalists and the
“Kraftgenies.” Among the seven fragments may be noted: “Lorenzo
Eschenheimers empfindsame Reise nach Laputa,” a clever satirical sketch
in the manner of Swift, bitterly castigating that of which the English
people claim to be the discoverers (sentimental journeying) and the
Germans think themselves the improvers.In “Bittschrift der
Wahnsinnigen” and “Parakletor” the unwholesome literary tendencies of
the age are further satirized.His brief essay, “Ueber die
Vornamen,”[21] is confessedly suggested by Sterne and the sketch “Dass
du auf dem Blockberg wärst,”[22] with its mention of the green book
entitled “Echte deutsche Flüche und Verwünschungen für alle Stände,” is
manifestly to be connected in its genesis with Sterne’s famous
collection of oaths.[23] Lichtenberg’s comparison of Sterne and Fielding
is familiar and significant.[24] “Aus Lichtenbergs Nachlass: Aufsätze,
Gedichte, Tagebuchblätter, Briefe,” edited by Albert Leitzmann,[25]
contains additional mention of Sterne.The name of Helfreich Peter Sturz may well be coupled with that of
Lichtenberg, as an opponent of the Sterne cult and its German
distortions, for his information and point of view were likewise drawn
direct from English sources.Sturz accompanied King Christian VII of
Denmark on his journey to France and England, which lasted from May 6,
1768, to January 14, 1769[26]; hence his stay in England falls in a time
but a few months after Sterne’s death (March 18, 1768), when the
ungrateful metropolis was yet redolent of the late lion’s wit and humor.Sturz was an accomplished linguist and a complete master of English,
hence found it easy to associate with Englishmen of distinction whom he
was privileged to meet through the favor of his royal patron.He became
acquainted with Garrick, who was one of Sterne’s intimate friends, and
from him Sturz learned much of Yorick, especially that more wholesome
revulsion of feeling against Sterne’s obscenities and looseness of
speech, which set in on English soil as soon as the potent personality
of the author himself had ceased to compel silence and blind opinion.England began to wonder at its own infatuation, and, gaining
perspective, to view the writings of Sterne in a more rational light.Into the first spread of this reaction Sturz was introduced, and the
estimate of Sterne which he carried away with him was undoubtedly
 by it.In his second letter written to the _Deutsches Museum_
and dated August 24, 1768, but strangely not printed till April,
1777,[27] he quotes Garrick with reference to Sterne, a notable word of
personal censure, coming in the Germany of that decade, when Yorick’s
admirers were most vehement in their claims.Garrick called him “a lewd
companion, who was more loose in his intercourse than in his writings
and generally drove all ladies away by his obscenities.”[28] Sturz adds
that all his acquaintances asserted that Sterne’s moral character went
through a process of disintegration in London.In the _Deutsches Museum_ for July, 1776, Sturz printed a poem entitled
“Die Mode,” in which he treats of the slavery of fashion and in several
stanzas deprecates the influence of Yorick.[29]

  “Und so schwingt sich, zum Genie erklärt,
  Strephon kühn auf Yorick’s Steckenpferd.Trabt mäandrisch über Berg und Auen,
  Reist empfindsam durch sein Dorfgebiet,
  Oder singt die Jugend zu erbauen
  Ganz Gefühl dem Gartengott ein Lied.Gott der Gärten, stöhnt die Bürgerin,
  Lächle gütig, Rasen und Schasmin
  Haucht Gerüche!Fliehet Handlungssorgen,
  Dass mein Liebster heute noch in Ruh
  Sein Mark-Einsaz-Lomber spiele--Morgen,
  Schliessen wir die Unglücksbude zu!”

A passage at the end of the appendix to the twelfth Reisebrief is
further indication of his opposition to and his contempt for the frenzy
of German sentimentalism.The poems of Goeckingk contain allusions[30] to Sterne, to be sure
partly indistinctive and insignificant, which, however, tend in the main
to a ridicule of the Yorick cult and place their author ultimately among
the satirical opponents of sentimentalism.In the “Epistel an Goldhagen
in Petershage,” 1771, he writes:

  “Doch geb ich wohl zu überlegen,
  Was für den Weisen besser sey:
  Die Welt wie Yorick mit zu nehmen?Nach Königen, wie Diogen,
  Sich keinen Fuss breit zu bequemen,”--

a query which suggests the hesitant point of view relative to the
advantage of Yorick’s excess of universal sympathy.In “Will auch ’n
Genie werden” the poet steps out more unmistakably as an adversary of
the movement and as a skeptical observer of the exercise of Yorick-like
sympathy.“Doch, ich Patronus, merkt das wohl,
    Geh, im zerrissnen Kittel,
  Hab’ aber alle Taschen voll
    Yorickischer Capittel.Doch lass’ ich, wenn mir’s Kurzweil schafft,
    Die Hülfe fleh’nden Armen
  Durch meinen Schweitzer, Peter Kraft,
    Zerprügeln ohn’ Erbarmen.”

Goeckingk openly satirizes the sentimental cult in the poem “Der
Empfindsame”

  “Herr Mops, der um das dritte Wort
  Empfindsamkeit im Munde führet,
  Und wenn ein Grashalm ihm verdorrt,
  Gleich einen Thränenstrom verlieret--
     .Mit meinem Weibchen thut er schier
  Gleich so bekannt wie ein Franzose;
  All’ Augenblicke bot er ihr
  Toback aus eines Bettlers Dose
  Mit dem, am Zaun in tiefem Schlaf
  Er einen Tausch wie Yorik traf.Der Unempfindsamkeit zum Hohn
  Hielt er auf eine Mück’ im Glase
  Beweglich einen Leichsermon,
  Purrt’ eine Flieg’ ihm an der Nase,
  Macht’ er das Fenster auf, und sprach:
  Zieh Oheim Toby’s Fliege nach!Durch Mops ist warlich meine Magd
  Nicht mehr bey Trost, nicht mehr bey Sinnen
  So sehr hat ihr sein Lob behagt,
  Dass sie empfindsam allen Spinnen
  Zu meinem Hause, frank und frey
  Verstattet ihre Weberey.Er trat mein Hündchen auf das Bein,
  Hilf Himmel!Welch’ ein Lamentiren!Es hätte mögen einen Stein
  Der Strasse zum Erbarmen rühren,
  Auch wedelt’ ihm in einem Nu
  Das Hündgen schon Vergebung zu.Hündchen, du beschämst mich sehr,
  Denn dass mir Mops von meinem Leben
  Drey Stunden stahl, wie schwer, wie schwer,
  Wird’s halten, das ihm zu vergeben?Denn Spinnen werden oben ein
  Wohl gar noch meine Mörder seyn.”

This poem is a rather successful bit of ridicule cast on the
over-sentimental who sought to follow Yorick’s foot-prints.The other allusions to Sterne[31] are concerned with his hobby-horse
idea, for this seems to gain the poet’s approbation and to have no share
in his censure.The dangers of overwrought sentimentality, of heedless surrender to the
emotions and reveling in their exercise,--perils to whose magnitude
Sterne so largely contributed--were grasped by saner minds, and
energetic protest was entered against such degradation of mind and
futile expenditure of feeling.Joachim Heinrich Campe, the pedagogical theorist, published in 1779[32]
a brochure, “Ueber Empfindsamkeit und Empfindelei in pädagogischer
Hinsicht,” in which he deprecates the tendency of “Empfindsamkeit” to
degenerate into “Empfindelei,” and explains at some length the
deleterious effects of an unbridled “Empfindsamkeit” and an unrestrained
outpouring of sympathetic emotions which finds no actual expression, no
relief in deeds.The substance of this warning essay is repeated, often
word for word, but considerably amplified with new material, and
rendered more convincing by increased breadth of outlook and
positiveness of assertion, the fruit of six years of observation and
reflection, as part of a treatise, entitled, “Von der nöthigen Sorge für
die Erhaltung des Gleichgewichts unter den menschlichen Kräften:
Besondere Warnung vor dem Modefehler die Empfindsamkeit zu überspannen.”
It is in the third volume of the “Allgemeine Revision des gesammten
Schul- und Erziehungswesens.”[33] The differentiation between
“Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei” is again and more accessibly repeated
in Campe’s later work, “Ueber die Reinigung und Bereicherung der
deutschen Sprache.”[34] In the second form of this essay (1785) Campe
speaks of the sentimental fever as an epidemic by no means entirely
cured.His analysis of “Empfindsamkeit” is briefly as follows: “Empfindsamkeit
ist die Empfänglichkeit zu Empfindnissen, in denen etwas Sittliches d.i.Freude oder Schmerz über etwas sittlich Gutes oder sittlich Böses, ist;”
yet in common use the term is applied only to a certain high degree of
such susceptibility.This sensitiveness is either in harmony or discord
with the other powers of the body, especially with the reason: if
equilibrium is maintained, this sensitiveness is a fair, worthy,
beneficent capacity (Fähigkeit); if exalted over other forces, it
becomes to the individual and to society the most destructive and
baneful gift which refinement and culture may bestow.Campe proposes to
limit the use of the word “Empfindsamkeit” to the justly proportioned
manifestation of this susceptibility; the irrational, exaggerated
development he would designate “überspannte Empfindsamkeit.”
“Empfindelei,” he says, “ist Empfindsamkeit, die sich auf eine
kleinliche alberne, vernunftlose und lächerliche Weise, also da äussert,
wo sie nicht hingehörte.” Campe goes yet further in his distinctions and
invents the monstrous word, “Empfindsamlichkeit” for the sentimentality
which is superficial, affected, sham (geheuchelte).Campe’s newly coined
word was never accepted, and in spite of his own efforts and those of
others to honor the word “Empfindsamkeit” and restrict it to the
commendable exercise of human sympathy, the opposite process was
victorious and “Empfindsamkeit,” maligned and scorned, came to mean
almost exclusively, unless distinctly modified, both what Campe
designates as “überspannte Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei,” and also
the absurd hypocrisy of the emotions which he seeks to cover with his
new word.Campe’s farther consideration contains a synopsis of method
for distinguishing “Empfindsamkeit” from “Empfindelei:” in the first
place through the manner of their incitement,--the former is natural,
the latter is fantastic, working without sense of the natural properties
of things.In this connection he instances as examples, Yorick’s feeling
of shame after his heartless and wilful treatment of Father Lorenzo,
and, in contrast with this, the shallowness of Sterne’s imitators who
whimpered over the death of a violet, and stretched out their arms and
threw kisses to the moon and stars.In the second place they are
distinguished in the manner of their expression: “Empfindsamkeit” is
“secret, unpretentious, laconic and serious;” the latter attracts
attention, is theatrical, voluble, whining, vain.Thirdly, they are
known by their fruits, in the one case by deeds, in the other by shallow
pretension.In the latter part of his volume, Campe treats the problem
of preventing the perverted form of sensibility by educative endeavor.The word “Empfindsamkeit” was afterwards used sometimes simply as an
equivalent of “Empfindung,” or sensation, without implication of the
manner of sensing: for example one finds in the _Morgenblatt_[35] a poem
named “Empfindsamkeiten am Rheinfalle vom Felsen der Galerie
abgeschrieben.” In the poem various travelers are made to express their
thoughts in view of the waterfall.A poet cries, “Ye gods, what a hell
of waters;” a tradesman, “away with the rock;” a Briton complains of the
“confounded noise,” and so on.It is plain that the word suffered a
generalization of meaning.A poetical expression of Campe’s main message is found in a book called
“Winterzeitvertreib eines königlichen preussischen Offiziers.”[36]
A poem entitled “Das empfindsame Herz” (p.210) has the following lines:

  “Freund, ein empfindsames Herz ist nicht für diese Welt,
  Von Schelmen wird’s verlacht, von Thoren wirds geprellt,
  Doch üb’ im Stillen das, was seine Stimme spricht.Dein Lohn ist dir gewiss, nur hier auf Erden nicht.”

In a similar vein of protest is the letter of G. Hartmann[37] to Denis,
dated Tübingen, February 10, 1773, in which the writer condemns the
affected sentimentalism of Jacobi and others as damaging to morals.“O best teacher,” he pleads with Denis, “continue to represent these
performances as unworthy.”

Möser in his “Patriotische Phantasien”[38] represents himself as
replying to a maid-in-waiting who writes in distress about her young
mistress, because the latter is suffering from “epidemic”
sentimentalism, and is absurdly unreasonable in her practical incapacity
and her surrender to her feelings.Möser’s sound advice is the
substitution of genuine emotion.The whole section is entitled “Für die
Empfindsamen.”

Knigge, in his “Umgang mit Menschen,” plainly has those Germans in mind
who saw in Uncle Toby’s treatment of the fly an incentive to
unreasonable emphasis upon the relations between man and the animal
world, when, in the chapter on the treatment of animals, he protests
against the silly, childish enthusiasm of those who cannot see a hen
killed, but partake of fowl greedily on the table, or who passionately
open the window for a fly.[39] A work was also translated from the
French of Mistelet, which dealt with the problem of “Empfindsamkeit:”
it was entitled “Ueber die Empfindsamkeit in Rücksicht auf das Drama,
die Romane und die Erziehung.”[40] An article condemning exaggerated
sentimentality was published in the _Deutsches Museum_ for February,
1783, under the title “Etwas über deutsche Empfindsamkeit.”

Goethe’s “Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit” is a merry satire on the
sentimental movement, but is not to be connected directly with Sterne,
since Goethe is more particularly concerned with the petty imitators of
his own “Werther.” Baumgartner in his Life of Goethe asserts that
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey was one of the books found inside the
ridiculous doll which the love-sick Prince Oronaro took about with him.This is not a necessary interpretation, for Andrason, when he took up
the first book, exclaimed merely “Empfindsamkeiten,” and, as Strehlke
observes,[41] it is not necessary here to think of a single work,
because the term was probably used in a general way, referring possibly
to a number of then popular imitations.The satires on “Empfindsamkeit” began to grow numerous at the end of the
seventies and the beginning of the eighties, so that the _Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung_, in October, 1785, feels justified in remarking that
such attempts are gradually growing as numerous as the “Empfindsame
Romane” themselves, and wishes, “so may they rot together in a
grave of oblivion.”[42] Anton Reiser, the hero of Karl Philipp
Moritz’sautobiographical novel (Berlin, 1785-90), begins a satire on
affected sentimentalism, which was to bring shafts of ridicule to bear
on the popular sham, and to throw appreciative light on the real
manifestation of genuine feeling.[43] A kindred satire was “Die
Geschichte eines Genies,” Leipzig, 1780, two volumes, in which the
prevailing fashion of digression is incidentally satirized.[44]

The most extensive satire on the sentimental movement, and most vehement
protest against its excesses is the four volume novel, “Der
Empfindsame,”[45] published anonymously in Erfurt, 1781-3, but
acknowledged in the introduction to the fourth volume by its author,
Christian Friedrich Timme.He had already published one novel in which
he exemplified in some measure characteristics of the novelists whom he
later sought to condemn and satirize, that is, this first novel,
“Faramond’s Familiengeschichte,”[46] is digressive and episodical.“Der
Empfindsame” is much too bulky to be really effective as a satire; the
reiteration of satirical jibes, the repetition of satirical motifs
slightly varied, or thinly veiled, recoil upon the force of the work
itself and injure the effect.The maintenance of a single satire through
the thirteen to fourteen hundred pages which four such volumes contain
is a Herculean task which we can associate only with a genius like
Cervantes.Then, too, Timme is an excellent narrator, and his original
purpose is constantly obscured by his own interest and the reader’s
interest in Timme’s own story, in his original creations, in the variety
of his characters.These obtrude upon the original aim of the book and
absorb the action of the story in such a measure that Timme often for
whole chapters and sections seems to forget entirely the convention of
his outsetting.His attack is threefold, the centers of his opposition being “Werther,”
“Siegwart” and Sterne, as represented by their followers and imitators.But the campaign is so simple, and the satirist has been to such trouble
to label with care the direction of his own blows, that it is not
difficult to separate the thrusts intended for each of his foes.Timme’s initial purpose is easily illustrated by reference to his first
chapter, where his point of view is compactly put and the soundness of
his critical judgment and the forcefulness of his satirical bent are
unequivocally demonstrated: This chapter, which, as he says, “may serve
instead of preface and introduction,” is really both, for the narrative
really begins only in the second chapter.“Every nation, every age,”
he says, “has its own doll as a plaything for its children, and
sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit) is ours.” Then with lightness and grace,
coupled with unquestionable critical acumen, he traces briefly the
growth of “Empfindsamkeit” in Germany.“Kaum war der liebenswürdige
Sterne auf sein Steckenpferd gestiegen, und hatte es uns vorgeritten;
so versammelten sich wie gewöhnlich in Teutschland alle Jungen an ihn
herum, hingen sich an ihn, oder schnizten sich sein Steckenpferd in der
Geschwindigkeit nach, oder brachen Stecken vom nächsten Zaun oder rissen
aus einem Reissigbündel den ersten besten Prügel, setzten sich darauf
und ritten mit einer solchen Wut hinter ihm drein, dass sie einen
Luftwirbel veranlassten, der alles, was ihm zu nahe kam, wie ein
reissender Strom mit sich fortris, wär es nur unter den Jungen
geblieben, so hätte es noch sein mögen; aber unglücklicherweise fanden
auch Männer Geschmack an dem artigen Spielchen, sprangen vom ihrem Weg
ab und ritten mit Stok und Degen und Amtsperüken unter den Knaben
einher.Freilich erreichte keiner seinen Meister, den sie sehr bald aus
dem Gesicht verloren, und nun die possirlichsten Sprünge von der Welt
machen und doch bildet sich jeder der Affen ein, er reite so schön wie
der Yorick.”[47]

This lively description of Sterne’s part in this uprising is, perhaps,
the best brief characterization of the phenomenon and is all the more
significant as coming from the pen of a contemporary, and written only
about a decade after the inception of the sentimental movement as
influenced and furthered by the translation of the Sentimental Journey.It represents a remarkable critical insight into contemporaneous
literary movements, the rarest of all critical gifts, but it has been
overlooked by investigators who have sought and borrowed brief words to
characterize the epoch.[48]

The contribution of “Werther” and “Siegwart” to the sentimental frenzy
are even as succinctly and graphically designated; the latter book,
published in 1776, is held responsible for a recrudescence of the
phenomenon, because it gave a new direction, a new tone to the faltering
outbursts of Sterne’s followers and indicated a more comprehensible and
hence more efficient, outlet for their sentimentalism.Now again, “every
nook resounded with the whining sentimentality, with sighs, kisses,
forget-me-nots, moonshine, tears and ecstasies;” those hearts excited by
Yorick’s gospel, gropingly endeavoring to find an outlet for their own
emotions which, in their opinion were characteristic of their arouser
and stimulator, found through “Siegwart” a solution of their problem,
a relief for their emotional excess.Timme insists that his attack is only on Yorick’s mistaken followers and
not on Sterne himself.He contrasts the man and his imitators at the
outset sharply by comments on a quotation from the novel, “Fragmente zur
Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit”[49] as typifying the outcry of these petty
imitators against the heartlessness of their misunderstanding
critics,--“Sanfter, dultender Yorick,” he cries, “das war nicht deine
Sprache!Du priesest dich nicht mit einer pharisäischen
Selbstgenügsamkeit und schimpftest nicht auf die, die dir nicht ähnlich
waren, ‘Doch!sprachst Du am Grabe Lorenzos, doch ich bin so weichherzig
wie ein Weib, aber ich bitte die Welt nicht zu lachen, sondern mich zu
bedauern!’ Ruhe deinem Staube, sanfter, liebevoller Dulter!und nur
einen Funken deines Geistes deinen Affen.”[50] He writes not for the
“gentle, tender souls on whom the spirit of Yorick rests,”[51] for those
whose feelings are easily aroused and who make quick emotional return,
who love and do the good, the beautiful, the noble; but for those who
“bei dem wonnigen Wehen und Anhauchen der Gottheithaltenden Natur, in
huldigem Liebessinn und himmelsüssem Frohsein dahin schmelzt.die ihr
vom Sang der Liebe, von Mondschein und Tränen euch nährt,” etc.,
etc.[52] In these few words he discriminates between the man and his
influence, and outlines his intentions to satirize and chastise the
insidious disease which had fastened itself upon the literature of the
time.This passage, with its implied sincerity of appreciation for the
real Yorick, is typical of Timme’s attitude throughout the book, and his
concern lest he should appear at any time to draw the English novelist
into his condemnation leads him to reiterate this statement of purpose
and to insist upon the contrast.Brükmann, a young theological student, for a time an intimate of the
Kurt home, is evidently intended to represent the soberer, well-balanced
thought of the time in opposition to the feverish sentimental frenzy of
the Kurt household.He makes an exception of Yorick in his condemnation
of the literary favorites, the popular novelists of that day, but he
deplores the effects of misunderstood imitation of Yorick’s work, and
argues his case with vehemence against this sentimental group.[53]
Brükmann differentiates too the different kinds of sentimentalism and
their effects in much the same fashion as Campe in his treatise
published two years before.[54] In all this Brükmann may be regarded as
the mouth-piece of the author.The clever daughter of the gentleman who
entertains Pank at his home reads a satirical poem on the then popular
literature, but expressly disclaims any attack on Yorick or “Siegwart,”
and asserts that her bitterness is intended for their imitators.Lotte,
Pank’s sensible and unsentimental, long-suffering fiancée, makes further
comment on the “apes” of Yorick, “Werther,” and “Siegwart.”

The unfolding of the story is at the beginning closely suggestive of
Tristram Shandy and is evidently intended to follow the Sterne novel in
a measure as a model.As has already been suggested, Timme’s own
narrative powers balk the continuity of the satire, but aid the interest
and the movement of the story.The movement later is, in large measure,
simple and direct.The hero is first introduced at his christening, and
the discussion of fitting names in the imposing family council is taken
from Walter Shandy’s hobby.The narrative here, in Sterne fashion, is
interrupted by a Shandean digression[55] concerning the influence of
clergymen’s collars and neck-bands upon the thoughts and minds of their
audiences.Such questions of chance influence of trifles upon the
greater events of life is a constant theme of speculation among the
pragmatics; no petty detail is overlooked in the possibility of its
portentous consequences.Walter Shandy’s hyperbolic philosophy turned
about such a focus, the exaltation of insignificant trifles into
mainsprings of action.In Shandy fashion the story doubles on itself after the introduction and
gives minute details of young Kurt’s family and the circumstances prior
to his birth.The later discussion[56] in the family council concerning
the necessary qualities in the tutor to be hired for the young Kurt is
distinctly a borrowing from Shandy.[57] Timme imitates Sterne’s method
of ridiculing pedantry; the requirements listed by the Diaconus and the
professor are touches of Walter Shandy’s misapplied, warped, and
undigested wisdom.In the nineteenth chapter of the third volume[58] we
find a Sterne passage associating itself with Shandy rather more than
the Sentimental Journey.It is a playful thrust at a score of places in
Shandy in which the author converses with the reader about the progress
of the book, and allows the mechanism of book-printing and the vagaries
of publishers to obtrude themselves upon the relation between writer and
reader.As a reminiscence of similar promises frequent in Shandy, the
author promises in the first chapter of the fourth volume to write a
book with an eccentric title dealing with a list of absurdities.[59]

But by far the greater proportion of the allusions to Sterne associate
themselves with the Sentimental Journey.A former acquaintance of Frau
Kurt, whose favorite reading was Shandy, Wieland’s “Sympatien” and the
Sentimental Journey, serves to satirize the influence of Yorick’s ass
episode; this gentleman wept at the sight of an ox at work, and never
ate meat lest he might incur the guilt of the murder of these sighing
creatures.[60]

The most constantly recurring form of satire is that of contradiction
between the sentimental expression of elevated, universal sympathy and
broader humanity and the failure to seize an immediately presented
opportunity to embody desire in deed.Thus Frau Kurt,[61] buried in
“Siegwart,” refuses persistently to be disturbed by those in immediate
need of a succoring hand.Pankraz and his mother while on a drive
discover an old man weeping inconsolably over the death of his dog.[62]
The scene of the dead ass at Nampont occurs at once to Madame Kurt and
she compares the sentimental content of these two experiences in
deprivation, finding the palm of sympathy due to the melancholy
dog-bewailer before her, thereby exalting the sentimental privilege of
her own experience as a witness.Quoting Yorick, she cries: “Shame on
the world!If men only loved one another as this man loves his dog!”[63]
At this very moment the reality of her sympathy is put to the test by
the approach of a wretched woman bearing a wretched child, begging for
assistance, but Frau Kurt, steeped in the delight of her sympathetic
emotion, repulses her rudely.Pankraz, on going home, takes his Yorick
and reads again the chapter containing the dead-ass episode; he spends
much time in determining which event was the more affecting, and tears
flow at the thought of both animals.In the midst of his vehement curses
on “unempfindsame Menschen,” “a curse upon you, you hard-hearted
monsters, who treat God’s creatures unkindly,” etc., he rebukes the
gentle advances of his pet cat Riepel, rebuffs her for disturbing his
“Wonnegefühl,” in such a heartless and cruel way that, through an
accident in his rapt delight at human sympathy, the ultimate result is
the poor creature’s death by his own fault.In the second volume[64] Timme repeats this method of satire, varying
conditions only, yet forcing the matter forward, ultimately, into the
grotesque comic, but again taking his cue from Yorick’s narrative about
the ass at Nampont, acknowledging specifically his linking of the
adventure of Madame Kurt to the episode in the Sentimental Journey.Frau
Kurt’s ardent sympathy is aroused for a goat drawing a wagon, and driven
by a peasant.She endeavors to interpret the sighs of the beast and
finally insists upon the release of the animal, which she asserts is
calling to her for aid.The poor goat’s parting bleat after its
departing owner is construed as a curse on the latter’s hardheartedness.During the whole scene the
neighboring village is in flames, houses are consumed and poor people
rendered homeless, but Frau Kurt expresses no concern, even regarding
the catastrophe as a merited affliction, because of the villagers’ lack
of sympathy with their domestic animals.The same means of satire is
again employed in the twelfth chapter of the same volume.[65] Pankraz,
overcome with pain because Lotte, his betrothed, fails to unite in his
sentimental enthusiasm and persists in common-sense, tries to bury his
grief in a wild ride through night and storm.His horse tramples
ruthlessly on a poor old man in the road; the latter cries for help, but
Pank, buried in contemplation of Lotte’s lack of sensibility, turns a
deaf ear to the appeal.In the seventeenth chapter of the third volume, a sentimental journey is
proposed, and most of the fourth volume is an account of this
undertaking and the events arising from its complications.Pankraz’s
adventures are largely repetitions of former motifs, and illustrate the
fate indissolubly linked with an imitation of Sterne’s related converse
with the fair sex.[66]

The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries.Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes.Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.[67]

Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of suggestions
aroused through fancied parallels between his own circumstances and
those related of Yorick.He finds a sorrowing woman[68] sitting, like
Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar tree.Pankraz insists upon carrying
out this striking analogy farther, which the woman, though she betrays
no knowledge of the Sentimental Journey, is not loath to accede to, as
it coincides with her own nefarious purposes.Timme in the following
scene strikes a blow at the abjectly sensual involved in much of the
then sentimental, unrecognized and unrealized.Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.[69] He buys the poor
creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the goat.The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee.The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs.Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it.The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,--a point already enforced in the conduct of Frau Kurt’s
goat.In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to “Eliza”
is brought into the narrative.Pankraz writes a letter wherein he
declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs.Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy[70] of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere.The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”

The elaborate division of moral preachers[71] into classes may be
further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered.And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters.But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked.On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened.And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time.Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies.Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion.Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries.The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and adaptation
of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and bespeaks
admiration and commendation.Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but it
never received the critical examination its merits deserved.Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ and the _Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_
ignore it completely.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_ announces the
book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the book itself is not reviewed
in its columns.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ accords
it a colorless and unappreciative review in which Timme is reproached
for lack of order in his work (a censure more applicable to the first
volume), and further for his treatment of German authors then
popular.[72] The latter statement stamps the review as unsympathetic
with Timme’s satirical purpose.In the _Erfurtische gelehrte
Zeitung_,[73] in the very house of its own publication, the novel is
treated in a long review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of
comprehension and indignant denunciation.The reviewer fears that the
author is a “Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the
public will find no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting
(Schnaken).He is incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were
then degenerate as compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s
attack on the popular writers is emphatically resented.“Aber nun kömmt
das Schlimme erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten
Schenies, aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden,
dem Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w.zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”

In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed.Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself.It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[74] alone seems to grasp the full
significance of the satire.“We acknowledge gladly,” says the reviewer,
“that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the rise,
development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence of
this moral pestilence;.that the author has penetrated deep into
the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for an
engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”

The second and third volumes are reviewed[75] with a brief word of
continued approbation.A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes.The book is more
earnest in its conception.Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel.He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
_dénouement_.The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination.This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a sad, a gentle, a vehement, a dallying,
a serious, a melancholy, sentimentality, the last being the most poetic,
the most perilous.The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing.In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality.This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure.She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.The story begins in letters,--a method of story-telling which was the
legacy of Richardson’s popularity--and this device is again employed in
the second volume (Part VII).Wilhelmine Arend is one of those whom
sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.We read of
her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a feather, that
she turned white and trembled when Dr.Braun hacked worms to pieces in
conducting a biological experiment.On one occasion she refused to drive
home, as this would take the horses out in the noonday sun and disturb
their noonday meal,--an exorbitant sympathy with brute creation which
owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.It is not necessary here to relate
the whole story.Wilhelmine’s excessive sentimentality estranges her
from her husband, a weak brutish man, who has no comprehension of her
feelings.He finds a refuge in the debasing affections of a French
opera-singer, Pouilly, and gradually sinks to the very lowest level of
degradation.This all is accomplished by the interposition and active
concern of friends, by efforts at reunion managed by benevolent
intriguers and kindly advisers.Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its sane
characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the observations
upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book are
trenchant, and often markedly clever.Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing.The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode.The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out.Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made.Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition.Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly because his leading character is not convincing, but
largely because his satirical exaggeration, and distortion of
characteristics, which by a process of selection renders satire
efficient, fails to make the exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but
renders her pitiful.At the same time this satirical warping impairs the
value of the book as a serious presentation of a prevailing malady.A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”[76] In this book we have a character with a
heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is attributed
“an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist a single
impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the present
impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of Graf.Z.,
the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife, their
reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness of
heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of the
same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”

Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary review,
“Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein blaues
Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777, 8vo).The book purports to be the
posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted with Yorick’s
German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick himself.The
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ (1778, pp.99-100) finds that the author
misjudges Yorick.The book is written in part if not entirely in verse.In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s _Merkur_ writes, begging this
authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey, M . . .and “die Beyträge zur Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und
Verstandes,” and thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”

In this way it is seen how from various sources and in various ways
protest was made against the real or distorted message of Laurence
Sterne.[Footnote 2: 1772, July 7.][Footnote 3: See Erich Schmidt’s “Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
    Goethe’s Jugendgenosse,” 2d edition, Jena, 1879, p. 82.][Footnote 4: Berlin, 1779, pp.[Footnote 5: XLIV, 1, p.[Footnote 6: Probably Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay, the poet and

    that the underlying thought of Musäus in his “Physiognomische
    Reisen” would, if handled by Lichtenberg, have made the most
    fruitful stuff for a humorous novel in Sterne’s style.][Footnote 12: II, 11-12: “Im ersten Fall wird er nie, nach dem die
    Stelle vorüber ist, seinen Sieg plötzlich aufgeben.So wie bei ihm
    sich die Leidenschaft kühlt, kühlt sie sich auch bei uns und er
    bringt uns ab, ohne dass wir es wissen.Hingegen im letztern Fall
    nimmt er sich selten die Mühe, sich seines Sieges zu bedienen,
    sondern wirft den Leser oft mehr zur Bewunderung seiner Kunst, als
    seines Herzens in eine andere Art von Verfassung hinein, die ihn
    selbst nichts kostet als Witz, den Leser fast um alles bringt, was
    er vorher gewonnen hatte.”]

  durch Frankreich und Italien, übersetzt von A. Lewald.I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates
the danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering
only the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable
to remain imprisoned.At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as
little as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of
both sexes.This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to
colonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males.However, so far
as we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times
in the Osmia's little brain.Enough for us to know that she dislikes
narrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they
are at the same time long.And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same
diameter.Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail.With the short tube
the two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided.She has very little
of that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the
home of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the
Mason-bee.Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at
most, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to
a long series.To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long
enough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow
enough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to
me a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would
stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with
entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it.On the other
hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,
seems to me at least quite possible.Guided by these considerations, I
embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the
complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to
produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a
series of lodgings suited only to males.Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs.I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with
little cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the
Three-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in
the deep cells and males in the shallow cells.That is how things go
when the old nest remains in its natural state.With a grater, however,
I scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the
cavities to some ten millimetres.(About two-fifths of an
inch.--Translator's Note.)This leaves in each cell just room for one
cocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper.Of the fourteen cavities in
the nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.)Nothing could be more striking than
the result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home
rearing.The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received
males; the two cavities left untouched received females.A year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;
but this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the
grater.Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by
males.It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the
offspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot
and kept in sight as long as her laying lasted.He would indeed be
difficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two
experiments.If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to
remove his last doubts.The Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,
especially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common
under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared
walls that support our terraces.In this species the spiral is wide
open, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage
permits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to
pass, the space necessary for the cell of a female.This cell is
succeeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a
line in the same way as in a straight tube.In the last whorl of the
spiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row.Then
longitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the
whole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males
predominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys.The
sequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube
and especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is
complicated by subdivisions on the same level.A single Snail-shell
contains room for six or eight cells.A large, rough earthen stopper
finishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.As a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my
swarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a
small swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the
usable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that
required by a male Osmia-cocoon.Moreover, the widest part, in which a
female might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below
which there will often be a free space.Under all these conditions, the
house will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.The collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes
specimens of different sizes.The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7
inch.--Translator's Note.)in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.)There is room for two cocoons, or
three at most, according to their dimensions.Now these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,
perhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery
sides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee.Some of them were
occupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had
started with a home of this sort would pass next to a second
Snail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a
fourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were
emptied.The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in
Snail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a
description of the worker.The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell
were in the minority.The greater number left the tubes to come to the
shells and then went back from the shells to the tubes.All, after
filling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house
with a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening.It was a long
and troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as
a mother and all her talents as a plasterer.When the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these
elegant abodes.The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my
anticipations to the letter.The great, the very great majority of the
cocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a
few rare females appear.The smallness of the space has almost done
away with the stronger sex.This result is demonstrated by the
sixty-eight Snail-shells colonized.But, of this total number, I must
use only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied
by the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season.Here
are a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.From the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,
the date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven
Snail-shells in succession.Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a
number very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve
belong to males and only two to females.Another, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with
a family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.A third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,
a prodigious task.She supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have
ever obtained from one Osmia.Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of
twenty-five males and one female.There is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially
as the other series would all, without exception, give us the same
result.Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse
the order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of
males before producing any females.There is something better still;
and this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:
the female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to
the point of disappearing altogether.We see this especially in the
third case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of
twenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding
Snail-shell.There would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only
females and no males, or very few.The first permutation makes the
second seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of
realizing it.The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions
of the home.When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females
tend to disappear.With generous quarters, the converse would not take
place.I should obtain females and afterwards an equal number of males,
confined in small cells which, in case of need, would be bounded by
numerous partitions.The factor of space does not enter into the
question here.What artifice can we then employ to provoke this second
permutation?So far, I can think of nothing that is worth attempting.Leading a retired life, in the solitude of a
village, having quite enough to do with patiently and obscurely
ploughing my humble furrow, I know little about modern scientific
views.In my young days I had a passionate longing for books and found
it difficult to procure them; to-day, when I could almost have them if
I wanted, I am ceasing to wish for them.It is what usually happens as
life goes on.I do not therefore know what may have been done in the
direction whither this study of the sexes has led me.If I am stating
propositions that are really new or at least more comprehensive than
the propositions already known, my words will perhaps sound heretical.No matter: as a simple translator of facts, I do not hesitate to make
my statement, being fully persuaded that time will turn my heresy into
orthodoxy.Bees lay their eggs in series of first females and then males, when the
two sexes are of different sizes and demand an unequal quantity of
nourishment.When the two sexes are alike in size, as in the case of
Latreille's Osmia, the same sequence may occur, but less regularly.This dual arrangement disappears when the place chosen for the nest is
not large enough to contain the entire laying.We then see broken
layings, beginning with females and ending with males.The egg, as it issues from the ovary, has not yet a fixed sex.The
final impress that produces the sex is given at the moment of laying,
or a little before.So as to be able to give each larva the amount of space and food that
suits it according as it is male or female, the mother can choose the
sex of the egg which she is about to lay.To meet the conditions of the
building, which is often the work of another or else a natural retreat
that admits of little or no alteration, she lays either a male egg or a
female egg AS SHE PLEASES.The distribution of the sexes depends upon
herself.Should circumstances require it, the order of the laying can
be reversed and begin with males; lastly, the entire laying can contain
only one sex.The same privilege is possessed by the predatory Hymenoptera, the
Wasps, at least by those in whom the two sexes are of a different size
and consequently require an amount of nourishment that is larger in the
one case than in the other.The mother must know the sex of the egg
which she is going to lay; she must be able to choose the sex of that
egg so that each larva may obtain its proper portion of food.Generally speaking, when the sexes are of different sizes, every insect
that collects food and prepares or selects a dwelling for its offspring
must be able to choose the sex of the egg in order to satisfy without
mistake the conditions imposed upon it.The question remains how this optional assessment of the sexes is
effected.If I should ever learn
anything about this delicate point, I shall owe it to some happy chance
for which I must wait, or rather watch, patiently.Then what explanation shall I give of the wonderful facts which I have
set forth?I do not explain facts, I relate
them.Growing daily more sceptical of the interpretations suggested to
me and more hesitating as to those which I myself may have to suggest,
the more I observe and experiment, the more clearly I see rising out of
the black mists of possibility an enormous note of interrogation.Dear insects, my study of you has sustained me and continues to sustain
me in my heaviest trials; I must take leave of you for to-day.The
ranks are thinning around me and the long hopes have fled.Shall I be
able to speak of you again?(This forms the closing paragraph of Volume
3 of the "Souvenirs entomologiques," of which the author lived to
publish seven more volumes, containing over 2,500 pages and nearly
850,000 words.--Translator's Note.)Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that
curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,
kindles a beacon at its tail-end.Who does not know it, at least by
name?Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from
the moon at its full?The Greeks of old called it lampouris, meaning,
the bright-tailed.Science employs the same term: it calls it the
lantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, Lin.In this case the common name
is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes
both expressive and accurate.In fact, we might easily cavil at the word "worm."The Lampyris is not
a worm at all, not even in general appearance.He has six short legs,
which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about.In the
adult state the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the true
Beetle that he is.The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows naught
of the delights of flying: all her life long she retains the larval
shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who himself
is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that comes
with pairing-time.Even in this initial stage the word "worm" is out of
place.We French have the expression "Naked as a worm" to point to the
lack of any defensive covering.Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to
say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather
richly : his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale
pink on the thorax, especially on the lower surface.Finally, each
segment is decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright
red.A costume like this was never worn by a worm.Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the
Lampyris feeds upon.That master of the art of gastronomy,
Brillat-Savarin, said: "Show me what you eat and I will tell you what
you are."A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to
every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to
the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the
world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of
life.Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an
eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare
villainy.This detail has long been known to entomologists.What is not so well
known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have read, is
the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other instance
anywhere.Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic: he
chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our
modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating
on him.The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,
such as, for instance, Helix variabilis, Drap., who, in the hot
weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and other long, dry
stalks by the road-side and there remains motionless, in profound
meditation, throughout the scorching summer days.It is in some such
resting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon
the Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralysed on its
shaky support by his surgical artifices.He frequents the edges of the
irrigating ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a
favourite haunt of the Mollusc.Here, he treats the game on the ground;
and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at home and
to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest detail.I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight.I place a
little grass in a wide glass jar.In this I instal a few Glow-worms and
a provision of snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too
small, chiefly Helix variabilis.Above
all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events come
unexpectedly and do not last long.The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,
which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell, except
the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly.Then the hunter's
weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be plainly
perceived without the aid of a lens.It consists of two mandibles bent
back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as a hair.The
microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove running throughout
the length.The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument.It
all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than
bites.As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of "tweaksies"
to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like a
tickling than a serious pinch.In conversing with
animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.It is the right
way for the simple to understand one another.The Lampyris doles out his tweaks.He distributes them methodically,
without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though
he wished to ascertain the effect produced.Their number is not great:
half a dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power
of movement.That other pinches are administered later, at the time of
eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,
because the sequel escapes me.The first few, however--there are never
many--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the
Mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say lightning, methods of
the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by
means of his grooved hooks.Here is the proof of the sudden efficacy of those twitches, so mild in
appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on the
edge of the mantle some four or five times.I prick him with a fine
needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell, still
leaves exposed.There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no reaction
against the brutality of the needle.A corpse itself could not give
fewer signs of life.Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me
Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the foot
slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent.A few
disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the
Mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the front
part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become limp and
give way under their own weight, dangling feebly like a broken stick.Not at all, for I can resuscitate the seeming
corpse at will.After two or three days of that singular condition
which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,
though this is not really essential to success, I give him a douche
which will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied Mollusc.In
about a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the
Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state.He revives, in
a manner; he recovers movement and sensibility.He is affected by the
stimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his
tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred.The general torpor,
a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright.What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a
time, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain?I can see
but one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia.The exploits of a
host of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is
motionless though not dead have taught us the skilful art of the
paralysing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its
venom.We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete
anaesthesia in its patient.Human science did not in reality invent
this art, which is one of the wonders of latter-day surgery.Much
earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,
others knew it as well.The animal's knowledge had a long start of
ours; the method alone has changed.Our operators proceed by making us
inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by
injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in
infinitesimal doses.Might we not one day be able to benefit from this
hint?What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,
if we understood the beastie's secrets better!What does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a
harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never
begin the quarrel of his own accord?We find in Algeria
a beetle known as Drilus maroccanus, who, though non-luminous,
approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his
habits.He, too, feeds on Land Molluscs.His prey is a Cyclostome with
a graceful spiral shell, tightly closed with a stony lid which is
attached to the animal by a powerful muscle.The lid is a movable door
which is quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house
and as easily opened when the hermit goes forth.With this system of
closing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the
Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the
look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time.At last the
need of air and food obliges the besieged non-combatant to show
himself: at least, the door is set slightly ajar.The
Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow.The door can no longer be
closed; and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress.Our
first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a
quick-acting pair of shears.The Drilus is
not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so
promptly.The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if
not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the
siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to
fasts indefinitely prolonged.Although I have never come across the
Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of
attack very similar to that of the Glow-worm.Like our own Snail-eater,
the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small pieces: it
renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks which are
easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet, consumes a
prey incapable of the least muscular effort.That is how I see things
by the unaided light of logic.Let us now return to the Glow-worm.When the Snail is on the ground,
creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any
difficulty.The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's
fore-part to a great extent exposed.Here, on the edges of the mantle,
contracted by the fear of danger, the Mollusc is vulnerable and
incapable of defence.But it also frequently happens that the Snail
occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or
perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone.This support serves him as a
temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try
to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition
that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference.If,
on the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit its
support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left uncovered,
this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who just nibbles
at the Mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound immobility
which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.The assailant has to
handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would
make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate
him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering.Now any
game falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for the
Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by the
discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking assiduous
searches.It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize
perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in position by a touch
of glue should be disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught;
it is necessary that the assailant should go to work with infinite
circumspection and without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction
should provoke a fall and endanger the prize.As we see, sudden and
profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling the Lampyris to
attain his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.Does he really eat, that is to say,
does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute
particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus?I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks
his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey by
a method recalling that of the maggot.Like the flesh-eating grub of
the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies his
prey before feeding on it.This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the
Glow-worm.The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is
a large one, like the common Snail, Helix aspersa.Soon a number of
guests hasten up--two, three, or more--and, without any quarrel with
the real proprietor, all alike fall to.Let us leave them to themselves
for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening
downwards.The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an
overturned saucepan.When the sated diners retire from this gruel, only
insignificant leavings remain.By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks
which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the Mollusc is
converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish
themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of
some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it.In
consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a
liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the
two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison and
at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the solid
flesh into fluid.Those two tiny implements, which can just be examined
through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.They are
hollow, and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, who sucks and
drains her capture without having to divide it; but there is this great
difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants, which are
afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the sand,
whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquifier, leaves nothing, or next
to nothing.With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of his
prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to a
preliminary liquefaction.And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is
sometimes anything but steady.My rearing-glasses supply me with
magnificent examples.Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in
my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass
pane, and fix themselves to it with a speck of glair.Mary moved to the hallway.This is a mere
temporary halt, in which the Mollusc is miserly with his adhesive
product, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send it
to the bottom of the jar.Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself up there, with
the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak legs.He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find an
entrance-slit, nibbles at it a little, renders it insensible and,
without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for
days on end.When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;
and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint
stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in
the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually
converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which the
first attack was delivered.These small details tell us how promptly
the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how dexterously the
Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall from a very
slippery, vertical support and without even shaking him on his slight
line of adhesion.Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy
legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed
to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable.And this
apparatus the Lampyris possesses.At the hinder end of the animal we
see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short, fleshy
appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a
rosette.There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion.If he would
fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a
grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on the
support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness.The same organ,
rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist the act of
progression.In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of self-propelled
<DW36>, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty white rose, a kind
of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but moving in every
direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but stick.The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and
brush.At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and
repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder parts, a
performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine.This is done
point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a
scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes in
the operation.What is his object in thus sponging himself, in dusting
and polishing himself so carefully?It is a question, apparently, of
removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of viscidity that
remain from the evil contact with the Snail.A wash and brush-up is not
superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the Mollusc has been
treated.If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming
his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself like
a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving fame.Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while retaining her
larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best during the
hottest part of summer.The lighting-apparatus occupies the last three
segments of the abdomen.On each of the first two it takes the form, on
the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the whole of the
arch; on the third the luminous part is much less and consists simply
of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two spots which shine
through to the back and are visible both above and below the animal.Belts and spots emit a glorious white light, delicately tinged with
blue.The general lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups:
first, the wide belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly,
the two spots of the final segments.The two belts, the exclusive
attribute of the marriageable female, are the parts richest in light:
to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she
lights her two resplendent scarves.But, before that, from the time of
the hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern.This
efflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,
which is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight.Its
brilliance heralds the pairing-time.Wings and flight there will be
none: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her
blazing beacon.The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,
acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he
possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end
segment.This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the
entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season.It appears
upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged.And we
must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the female
shine only under the abdomen.My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were; but,
as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the
luminous organs.I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to separate
pretty nearly half of one of the shining belts.On the skin a sort of white-wash lies spread,
formed of a very fine, granular substance.This is certainly the
light-producing matter.To examine this white layer more closely is
beyond the power of my weary eyes.Just beside it is a curious
air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches suddenly into a
sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.These creep over the
luminous sheet, or even dip into it.The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs
and the work produced is an oxidation.The white sheet supplies the
oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush
distributes the flow of air over it.There remains the question of the
substance whereof this sheet is formed.The first suggestion was
phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word.The Glow-worm was
calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple
substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a
satisfactory answer along these lines.Phosphorus seems to play no part
here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes
bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam.The answer lies elsewhere, no one
knows where.We are better-informed as regards another question.Has the Glow-worm a
free control of the light which he emits?Can he turn it on or down or
put it out as he pleases?Has he an opaque screen which is drawn over
the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed?There is no
need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for its
revolving light.The thick air-tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the
flow of air and the light is intensified; the same tube, swayed by the
animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the
light grows fainter or even goes out.It is, in short, the mechanism of
a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion.We must here
distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the
exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the
modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any
age.In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden
and complete, or nearly so.In my nocturnal hunts for young Glow-worms,
measuring about 5 millimetres long (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.), I
can plainly see the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the
least false step disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at
once and the coveted insect becomes invisible.Upon the full-grown
females, lit up with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has
but a slight effect and often none at all.I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my
menagerie of females in the open air.The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before.I take a
spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock.Not
one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most, there is a
brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases.I send a puff
of smoke from my pipe into the cage.There are even some extinctions, but these do not last long.Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.I take
some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease them a
little.The illumination continues and is not much diminished, if I do
not press hard with my thumb.At this period, with the pairing close at
hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its passionate splendour, and
nothing short of very serious reasons would make it put out its signals
altogether.All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm
himself manages his lighting apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it
at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of the
insect is without effect.I detach a strip of the epidermis showing one
of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube, which I close
with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid an over-rapid evaporation.Well,
this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although not quite as
brilliantly as on the living body.The oxidizable substance, the
luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding
atmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;
and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as
when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus
of the chemists.Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness
continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished
in water deprived of its air by boiling.No better proof could be found
of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's light
is the effect of a slow oxidation.The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark
dropped by the full moon.Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble
illuminant.If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect
darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even
words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond
a narrow zone.A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's patience.Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another.Each
of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up
its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each individual
specimen.But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in which our
eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium distance.The collective lights confuse the light-bearers into one vague whole.Photography gives us a striking proof of this.I have a score of
females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in
the open air.A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their
establishment.When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle
and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at
every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous
clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the
photographer's plates and paper.All that I
obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there
according to the numbers forming the group.There is no picture of the
Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme.For
want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a
blurred splash of white on a black ground.The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,
invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the
lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned
males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the
air, sometimes a great way up.In its normal position, therefore, the
glittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is
covered by the thick bulk of the bride.The lantern ought really to
gleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is
hidden under a bushel.The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female
has her little wiles of coquetry.At nightfall, every evening, my caged
captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have thoughtfully
furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper branches, those
most in sight.Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they did at the foot
of the bush just now, they indulge in violent exercises, twist the tip
of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to one side, turn it to the
other, jerk it in every direction.In this way, the searchlight cannot
fail to gleam, at one moment or another, before the eyes of every male
who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood, whether on the ground or in the
air.It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching
Larks.If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird
indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it
excites it.While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains, the
male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to
catch from afar the least reflection of the calling signal.His
corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in
the form of a peaked cap or a shade, the object of which appears to be
to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the luminous
speck to be discerned.Under this arch are the two eyes, which are
relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a skull-cap and
contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove for the
insertion of the antennae.This double eye, occupying almost the whole
face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the spreading
peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclops' eye.At the moment of the pairing the illumination becomes much fainter, is
almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble fairy-lamp
of the last segment.This discreet night-light is enough for the
wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects, lingering
over their respective affairs, murmur the universal marriage-hymn.The round, white eggs are laid, or rather
strewn at random, without the least care on the mother's part, either
on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of grass.These brilliant
ones know nothing at all of family affection.Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even
when still contained in the mother's womb.If I happen by accident to
crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny
streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel filled
with a phosphorescent fluid.The
luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is
already made manifest through this clumsy midwifery.A soft opalescent
light shines through the integument of the belly.The young of either sex
have two little rush-lights on the last segment.At the approach of the
severe weather they go down into the ground, but not very far.In my
rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth, they
descend to a depth of three or four inches at most.I dig up a few in
mid-winter.I always find them carrying their faint stern-light.About
the month of April they come up again to the surface, there to continue
and complete their evolution.From start to finish the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise.The full-grown females are
magnificent lighthouses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the
grubs already possessed.We can understand the object of the feminine
beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display?To
my great regret, I cannot tell.It is and will be, for many a day to
come, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is
deeper than the physics of the books.THE CABBAGE-CATERPILLAR.The cabbage of our modern kitchen-gardens is a semi-artificial plant,
the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the
niggardly gifts of nature.Spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the
long-stalked, scanty-leaved, ill-smelling wilding, as found, according
to the botanists, on the ocean cliffs.He had need of a rare
inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to
improve it in his garden-patch.Progressing by infinitesimal degrees, culture wrought miracles.It
began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves,
beaten by the sea-winds, and to replace them by others, ample and
fleshy and close-fitting.It deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a
large compact head, white and tender.In our day, among the successors
of those first tiny hearts, are some that, by virtue of their massive
bulk, have earned the glorious name of chou quintal, as who should say
a hundredweight of cabbage.Later, man thought of obtaining a generous dish with a thousand little
sprays of the inflorescence.Under the cover of
the central leaves, it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom, its
flower-stalks, its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy
conglomeration.Differently entreated, the plant, economizing in the centre of its
shoot, set a whole family of close-wrapped cabbages ladder-wise on a
tall stem.A multitude of dwarf leaf-buds took the place of the
colossal head.Next comes the turn of the stump, an unprofitable, almost wooden,
thing, which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a
support for the plant.But the tricks of gardeners are capable of
everything, so much so that the stalk yields to the grower's
suggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to
the turnip, of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence, flavour
and delicacy; only the strange product serves as a base for a few
sparse leaves, the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose
its attributes entirely.If the stem allows itself to be allured, why not the root?It does, in
fact, yield to the blandishments of agriculture: it dilates its pivot
into a flat turnip, which half emerges from the ground.This is the
rutabaga, or swede, the turnip-cabbage of our northern districts.Incomparably docile under our nursing, the cabbage has given its all
for our nourishment and that of our cattle: its leaves, its flowers,
its buds, its stalk, its root; all that it now wants is to combine the
ornamental with the useful, to smarten itself, to adorn our flowerbeds
and cut a good figure on a drawing-room table.It has done this to
perfection, not with its flowers, which, in their modesty, continue
intractable, but with its curly and variegated leaves, which have the
undulating grace of Ostrich-feathers and the rich colouring of a mixed
bouquet.None who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the
near relation of the vulgar "greens" that form the basis of our
cabbage-soup.The cabbage, first in order of date in our kitchen-gardens, was held in
high esteem by classic antiquity, next after the bean and, later, the
pea; but it goes much farther back, so far indeed that no memories of
its acquisition remain.History pays but little attention to these
details: it celebrates the battle-fields whereon we meet our death, but
scorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive; it knows the
names of the kings' bastards, but cannot tell us the origin of wheat.This silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most
regrettable.The cabbage in particular, the venerable cabbage, that
denizen of the most ancient garden-plots, would have had extremely
interesting things to teach us.It is a treasure in itself, but a
treasure twice exploited, first by man and next by the caterpillar of
the Pieris, the common Large White Butterfly whom we all know (Pieris
brassicae, Lin.).This caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves
of all varieties of cabbage, however dissimilar in appearance: he
nibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli, curly greens
and savoy, swedes and turnip-tops, in short, all that our ingenuity,
lavish of time and patience, has been able to obtain from the original
plant since the most distant ages.But what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with
copious provender?Obviously the Pieris did not wait for the advent of
man and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of
life.She lived without us and would have continued to live without us.A Butterfly's existence is not subject to ours, but rightfully
independent of our aid.Before the white-heart, the cauliflower, the savoy and the others were
invented, the Pieris' caterpillar certainly did not lack food: he
browsed on the wild cabbage of the cliffs, the parent of all the
latter-day wealth; but, as this plant is not widely distributed and is,
in any case, limited to certain maritime regions, the welfare of the
Butterfly, whether on plain or hill, demanded a more luxuriant and more
common plant for pasturage.This plant was apparently one of the
Cruciferae, more or less seasoned with sulpheretted essence, like the
cabbages.I rear the Pieris' caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wall-rocket
(Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Dec.), which imbibes strong spices along the
edge of the paths and at the foot of the walls.Penned in a large
wire-gauze bell-cage, they accept this provender without demur; they
nibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage; and they end by
producing chrysalids and Butterflies.The change of fare causes not the
least trouble.I am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour:
white mustard (Sinapis incana, Lin.), dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria,
Lin.), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, Lin.), whitlow pepperwort
(Lepidium draba, Lin.), hedge-mustard (Sisymbrium officinale, Scop.).On the other hand, the leaves of the lettuce, the bean, the pea, the
corn-salad are obstinately refused.Let us be content with what we have
seen: the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the
cabbage-caterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers,
perhaps even on all.As these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bell-cage, one
might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed, in the absence
of better things, on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for
itself.Having naught else within their reach, the starvelings consume
any and all Cruciferae, without distinction of species.Can things
sometimes be the same in the open fields, where I play none of my
tricks?Can the family of the White Butterfly be settled on other
Crucifers than the cabbage?I start a quest along the paths near the
gardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as
crowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage.Now, except when the metamorphosis is at hand, the caterpillar of the
White Butterfly never travels: he does all his growing on the identical
plant whereon he saw the light.The caterpillars observed on the wild
radish, as well as other households, are not, therefore, emigrants who
have come as a matter of fancy from some cabbage-patch in the
neighbourhood: they have hatched on the very leaves where I find them.Hence I arrive at this conclusion: the White Butterfly, who is fitful
in her flight, chooses cabbage first, to dab her eggs upon, and
different Cruciferae next, varying greatly in appearance.How does the Pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain?We have seen the Larini (A species of Weevils found on
thistle-heads.--Translator's Note.), those explorers of fleshy
receptacles with an artichoke flavour, astonish us with their knowledge
of the flora of the thistle tribe; but their lore might, at a pinch, be
explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg.With
their rostrum, they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle
exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before
entrusting their eggs to it.On the other hand, the Butterfly, a
nectar-drinker, makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities
of the leafage; at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers, she
abstracts a mouthful of syrup.This means of investigation, moreover,
would be of no use to her, for the plant selected for the establishing
of her family is, for the most part, not yet in flower.The mother
flits for a moment around the plant; and that swift examination is
enough: the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found
suitable.The botanist, to recognize a crucifer, requires the indication provided
by the flower.She does not consult the
seed-vessel, to see if it be long or short, nor yet the petals, four in
number and arranged in a cross, because the plant, as a rule, is not in
flower; and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars,
in spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a
botanical expert.Unless the Pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her,
it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm.She needs for her family Cruciferae, nothing but Cruciferae; and she
knows this group of plants to perfection.I have been an enthusiastic
botanist for half a century and more.Nevertheless, to discover if this
or that plant, new to me, is or is not one of the Cruciferae, in the
absence of flowers and fruits I should have more faith in the
Butterfly's statements than in all the learned records of the books.Where science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible.The Pieris has two families a year: one in April and May, the other in
September.The cabbage-patches are renewed in those same months.The
Butterfly's calendar tallies with the gardener's: the moment that
provisions are in sight, consumers are forthcoming for the feast.The eggs are a bright orange-yellow and do not lack prettiness when
examined under the lens.They are blunted cones, ranged side by side on
their round base and adorned with finely-scored longitudinal ridges.They are collected in slabs, sometimes on the upper surface, when the
leaf that serves as a support is spread wide, sometimes on the lower
surface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones.Slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent;
isolated eggs, or eggs collected in small groups, are, on the contrary,
rare.The mother's output is affected by the degree of quietness at the
moment of laying.The outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed, but the
inside presents a certain order.The eggs are here arranged in straight
rows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a
double support in the preceding row.This alternation, without being of
an irreproachable precision, gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the
whole.To see the mother at her laying is no easy matter: when examined too
closely, the Pieris decamps at once.The structure of the work,
however, reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly.The
ovipositor swings slowly first in this direction, then in that, by
turns; and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs
in the previous row.The extent of the oscillation determines the
length of the row, which is longer or shorter according to the layer's
fancy.The hatching takes place in about a week.It is almost simultaneous for
the whole mass: as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg, the
others come out also, as though the natal impulse were communicated
from one to the other.In the same way, in the nest of the Praying
Mantis, a warning seems to be spread abroad, arousing every one of the
population.It is a wave propagated in all directions from the point
first struck.The egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the
vegetable-pods whose seeds have attained maturity; it is the new-born
grub itself that contrives an exit-way by gnawing a hole in its
enclosure.In this manner, it obtains near the top of the cone a
symmetrical dormer-window, clean-edged, with no joins nor unevenness of
any kind, showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and
swallowed.But for this breach, which is just wide enough for the
deliverance, the egg remains intact, standing firmly on its base.It is
now that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure.What
it sees is a bag made of ultra-fine gold-beater's skin, translucent,
stiff and white, retaining the complete form of the original egg.A
score of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base.It is
the wizard's pointed cap, the mitre with the grooves carved into
jewelled chaplets.All said, the Cabbage-caterpillar's birth-casket is
an exquisite work of art.The hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the
swarming family musters on the layer of swaddling-clothes, still in the
same position.For a long time, before descending to the fostering
leaf, it lingers on this kind of hot-bed, is even very busy there.It is browsing a strange kind of grass, the handsome mitres
that remain standing on end.Slowly and methodically, from top to base,
the new-born grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged.By
to-morrow, nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots, the
bases of the vanished sacks.As his first mouthfuls, therefore, the Cabbage-caterpillar eats the
membranous wrapper of his egg.This is a regulation diet, for I have
never seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the
adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin
bottles furnish forth the feast.It is the first time that I have seen
a larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born.Of what use can
this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar?I suspect as follows:
the leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly
always slant considerably.To graze on them without risking a fall,
which would be fatal in earliest childhood, is hardly possible unless
with moorings that afford a steady support.What is needed is bits of
silk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made, something
for the legs to grip, something to provide a good anchorage even when
the grub is upside down.The silk-tubes, where those moorings are
manufactured, must be very scantily supplied in a tiny, new-born
animal; and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the
aid of a special form of nourishment.Then what shall the nature of the
first food be?Vegetable matter, slow to elaborate and niggardly in its
yield, does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well, for time
presses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf.An
animal diet would be preferable: it is easier to digest and undergoes
chemical changes in a shorter time.The wrapper of the egg is of a
horny nature, as silk itself is.It will not take long to transform the
one into the other.The grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg
and turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys.If my surmise is well-founded, there is reason to believe that, with a
view to speedily filling the silk-glands to which they look to supply
them with ropes, other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth
and steeply-slanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the
membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg.The whole of the platform of birth-sacks which was the first
camping-ground of the White Butterfly's family is razed to the ground;
naught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that
composed it.The structure of piles has disappeared; the prints left by
the piles remain.The little caterpillars are now on the level of the
leaf which shall henceforth feed them.They are a pale orange-yellow,
with a sprinkling of white bristles.The head is a shiny black and
remarkably powerful; it already gives signs of the coming gluttony.The
little animal measures scarcely two millimetres in length.(.078
inch.--Translator's Note.)The troop begins its steadying-work as soon as it comes into contact
with its pasturage, the green cabbage-leaf.Here, there, in its
immediate neighbourhood, each grub emits from its spinning glands short
cables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of
them.This is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost
imponderable atom.The grub's length promptly increases
from two millimetres to four.Soon, a moult takes place which alters
its costume: its skin becomes speckled, on a pale-yellow ground, with a
number of black dots intermingled with white bristles.Three or four
days of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover.When
this is over, the hunger-fit starts that will make a ruin of the
cabbage within a few weeks.What a stomach, working continuously day and night!It is a devouring laboratory, through which the foodstuffs merely pass,
transformed at once.I serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves
picked from among the biggest: two hours later, nothing remains but the
thick midribs; and even these are attacked when there is any delay in
renewing the victuals.At this rate a "hundredweight-cabbage," doled
out leaf by leaf, would not last my menagerie a week.The gluttonous animal, therefore, when it swarms and multiplies, is a
scourge.How are we to protect our gardens against it?In the days of
Pliny, the great Latin naturalist, a stake was set up in the middle of
the cabbage-bed to be preserved; and on this stake was fixed a Horse's
skull bleached in the sun: a Mare's skull was considered even better.This sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood.My confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one; my reason
for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in
our own days, at least in my part of the country.Nothing is so
long-lived as absurdity.Tradition has retained in a simplified form,
the ancient defensive apparatus of which Pliny speaks.For the Horse's
skull our people have substituted an egg-shell on the top of a switch
stuck among the cabbages.It is easier to arrange; also it is quite as
useful, that is to say, it has no effect whatever.Everything, even the nonsensical, is capable of explanation with a
little credulity.When I question the peasants, our neighbours, they
tell me that the effect of the egg-shell is as simple as can be: the
Butterflies, attracted by the whiteness, come and lay their eggs upon
it.Broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless
support, the little caterpillars die; and that makes so many fewer.I insist; I ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of
young caterpillars on those white shells."Never," they reply, with one voice."It was done in the old days and so we go on doing it: that's all we
know; and that's enough for us."I leave it at that, persuaded that the memory of the Horse's skull,
used once upon a time, is ineradicable, like all the rustic absurdities
implanted by the ages.We have, when all is said, but one means of protection, which is to
watch and inspect the cabbage-leaves assiduously and crush the slabs of
eggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet.Nothing is so effective as this method, which makes great demands on
one's time and vigilance.What pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage!And
what a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil, those
ragged heroes, who provide us with the wherewithal to live!To eat and digest, to accumulate reserves whence the Butterfly will
issue: that is the caterpillar's one and only business.The
Cabbage-caterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony.Incessantly
it browses, incessantly digests: the supreme felicity of an animal
which is little more than an intestine.There is never a distraction,
unless it be certain see-saw movements which are particularly curious
when several caterpillars are grazing side by side, abreast.Then, at
intervals, all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly
lowered, time after time, with an automatic precision worthy of a
Prussian drill-ground.Can it be their method of intimidating an always
possible aggressor?Can it be a manifestation of gaiety, when the
wanton sun warms their full paunches?Whether sign of fear or sign of
bliss, this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves
until the proper degree of plumpness is attained.After a month's grazing, the voracious appetite of my caged herd is
assuaged.The caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction,
walk about anyhow, with their forepart raised and searching space.Here
and there, as they pass, the swaying herd put forth a thread.They
wander restlessly, anxiously to travel afar.The exodus now prevented
by the trellised enclosure I once saw under excellent conditions.At
the advent of the cold weather, I had placed a few cabbage-stalks,
covered with caterpillars, in a small greenhouse.Those who saw the
common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass, in the company
of the pelargonium and the Chinese primrose, were astonished at my
curious fancy.I had my plans: I wanted to find out
how the family of the Large White Butterfly behaves when the cold
weather sets in.At the end of
November, the caterpillars, having grown to the desired extent, left
the cabbages, one by one, and began to roam about the walls.None of
them fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation.I
suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air,
exposed to all the rigours of winter.I therefore left the door of the
hothouse open.I found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls, some thirty
yards off.The thrust of a ledge, the eaves formed by a projecting bit
of mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place
and where the winter was passed.The Cabbage-caterpillar possesses a
robust constitution, unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold.All that
he needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging, free from permanent
damp.The inmates of my fold, therefore, move about for a few days on the
trelliswork, anxious to travel afar in search of a wall.Finding none
and realizing that time presses, they resign themselves.Each one,
supporting himself on the trellis, first weaves around himself a thin
carpet of white silk, which will form the sustaining layer at the time
of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis.He fixes his
rear-end to this base by a silk pad and his fore-part by a strap that
passes under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet.Thus slung from his three fastenings, he strips himself of his larval
apparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air, with no protection
save that of the wall, which the caterpillar would certainly have found
had I not interfered.Of a surety, he would be short-sighted indeed that pictured a world of
good things prepared exclusively for our advantage.The earth, the
great foster-mother, has a generous breast.At the very moment when
nourishing matter is created, even though it be with our own zealous
aid, she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers, who are all
the more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more
amply spread.The cherry of our orchards is excellent eating: a maggot
contends with us for its possession.In vain do we weigh suns and
planets: our supremacy, which fathoms the universe, cannot prevent a
wretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit.We make
ourselves at home in a cabbage bed: the sons of the Pieris make
themselves at home there too.Preferring broccoli to wild radish, they
profit where we have profited; and we have no remedy against their
competition save caterpillar-raids and egg-crushing, a thankless,
tedious, and none too efficacious work.The Cabbage-caterpillar eagerly
puts forth his own, so much so that the cultivation of the precious
plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its
defence.These others are the auxiliaries (The author employs this word
to denote the insects that are helpful, while describing as "ravagers"
the insects that are hurtful to the farmer's crops.--Translator's
Note.), our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy.The words
friend and foe, auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions
of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth.He is our
foe who eats or attacks our crops; our friend is he who feeds upon our
foes.Everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites.In the name of the might that is mine, of trickery, of highway robbery,
clear out of that, you, and make room for me: give me your seat at the
banquet!That is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or
less, alas, in our own world as well!Now, among our entomological auxiliaries, the smallest in size are the
best at their work.One of them is charged with watching over the
cabbages.She is so small, she works so discreetly that the gardener
does not know her, has not even heard of her.Were he to see her by
accident, flitting around the plant which she protects, he would take
no notice of her, would not suspect the service rendered.I propose to
set forth the tiny <DW40>'s deserts.Scientists call her Microgaster glomeratus.What exactly was in the
mind of the author of the name Microgaster, which means little belly?Did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen?However slight the belly may be, the insect nevertheless possesses one,
correctly proportioned to the rest of the body, so that the classic
denomination, far from giving us any information, might mislead us,
were we to trust it wholly.Nomenclature, which changes from day to day
and becomes more and more cacophonous, is an unsafe guide.Instead of
asking the animal what its name is, let us begin by asking:

"What can you do?Well, the Microgaster's business is to exploit the Cabbage-caterpillar,
a clearly-defined business, admitting of no possible confusion.In the spring, let us inspect the neighbourhood of
the kitchen-garden.Be our eye never so unobservant, we shall notice
against the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges
some very small yellow cocoons, heaped into masses the size of a
hazel-nut.Beside each group lies a Cabbage-caterpillar, sometimes dying,
sometimes dead, and always presenting a most tattered appearance.These
cocoons are the work of the Microgaster's family, hatched or on the
point of hatching into the perfect stage; the caterpillar is the dish
whereon that family has fed during its larval state.The epithet
glomeratus, which accompanies the name of Microgaster, suggests this
conglomeration of cocoons.Let us collect the clusters as they are,
without seeking to separate them, an operation which would demand both
patience and dexterity, for the cocoons are closely united by the
inextricable tangle of their surface-threads.In May a swarm of pigmies
will sally forth, ready to get to business in the cabbages.Colloquial language uses the terms Midge and Gnat to describe the tiny
insects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight.There is
something of everything in those aerial ballets.It is possible that
the persecutrix of the Cabbage-caterpillar is there, along with many
another; but the name of Midge cannot properly be applied to her.He
who says Midge says Fly, Dipteron, two-winged insect; and our friend
has four wings, one and all adapted for flying.By virtue of this
characteristic and others no less important, she belongs to the order
of Hymenoptera.(This order includes the Ichneumon-flies, of whom the
Microgaster is one.--Translator's Note.)No matter: as our language
possesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary, let
us use the expression Midge, which pretty well conveys the general
idea.Our Midge, the Microgaster, is the size of an average Gnat.She
measures 3 or 4 millimetres.(.117 to.156 inch.--Translator's Note.)The two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume, a black
uniform, all but the legs, which are pale red.In spite of this
likeness, they are easily distinguished.The male has an abdomen which
is slightly flattened and, moreover, curved at the tip; the female,
before the laying, has hers full and perceptibly distended by its
ovular contents.This rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for
our purpose.If we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its
manner of living, it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of
Cabbage-caterpillars.Whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our
garden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest, by this
means we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes.In the course of June, which is the time when the caterpillars quit
their pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other, those
in my fold, finding nothing better, climb to the dome of the cage to
make their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the
chrysalid's needs.Among these spinners we see some weaklings working
listlessly at their carpet.Their appearance makes us deem them in the
grip of a mortal disease.I take a few of them and open their bellies,
using a needle by way of a scalpel.What comes out is a bunch of green
entrails, soaked in a bright yellow fluid, which is really the
creature's blood.These tangled intestines swarm with little lazy
grubs, varying greatly in number, from ten or twenty at least to
sometimes half a hundred.They are the offspring of the Microgaster.The lens makes conscientious enquiries; nowhere
does it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment, fatty
tissues, muscles or other parts; nowhere do I see them bite, gnaw, or
dissect.The following experiment will tell us more fully: I pour into
a watch-glass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches.I
flood them with caterpillar's blood obtained by simple pricks; I place
the preparation under a glass bell-jar, in a moist atmosphere, to
prevent evaporation; I repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh
bleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from
the living caterpillar.Thanks to these precautions, my charges have
all the appearance of excellent health; they drink and thrive.But this
state of things cannot last long.Soon ripe for the transformation, my
grubs leave the dining-room of the watch-glass as they would have left
the caterpillar's belly; they come to the ground to try and weave their
tiny cocoons.They have missed a
suitable support, that is to say, the silky carpet provided by the
dying caterpillar.No matter: I have seen enough to convince me.The
larvae of the Microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word;
they live on soup; and that soup is the caterpillar's blood.Examine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is
bound to be a liquid one.They are little white grubs, neatly
segmented, with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks, as
though the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink.It moves
its hind-quarters slowly, without shifting its position.The mouth is a pore, devoid of any apparatus for
disintegration-work: it has no fangs, no horny nippers, no mandibles;
its attack is just a kiss.It does not chew, it sucks, it takes
discreet sips at the moisture all around it.The fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my
autopsy of the stricken caterpillars.In the patient's belly,
notwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the
nurse's entrails, everything is in perfect order; nowhere do we see a
trace of mutilation.Nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc
within.The exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully,
giving no sign of pain.It is impossible for me to distinguish them
from the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled
digestion.When the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the
chrysalis, an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that
is at their vitals.They are stoics who do not
forget their duty in the hour of death.At last they expire, quite
softly, not of any wounds, but of anaemia, even as a lamp goes out when
the oil comes to an end.The living caterpillar,
capable of feeding himself and forming blood, is a necessity for the
welfare of the grubs; he has to last about a month, until the
Microgaster's offspring have achieved their full growth.The two
calendars synchronize in a remarkable way.When the caterpillar leaves
off eating and makes his preparations for the metamorphosis, the
parasites are ripe for the exodus.The bottle dries up when the
drinkers cease to need it; but until that moment it must remain more or
less well-filled, although becoming limper daily.It is important,
therefore, that the caterpillar's existence be not endangered by wounds
which, even though very tiny, would stop the working of the
blood-fountains.With this intent, the drainers of the bottle are, in a
manner of speaking, muzzled; they have by way of a mouth a pore that
sucks without bruising.The dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a
slow oscillation of the head.The moment now comes for the parasites to
emerge.This happens in June and generally at nightfall.A breach is
made on the ventral surface or else in the sides, never on the back:
one breach only, contrived at a point of minor resistance, at the
junction of two segments; for it is bound to be a toilsome business, in
the absence of a set of filing-tools.Perhaps the grubs take one
another's places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it
with a kiss.In one short spell, the whole tribe issues through this single opening
and is soon wriggling about, perched on the surface of the caterpillar.The lens cannot perceive the hole, which closes on the instant.There
is not even a haemorrhage: the bottle has been drained too thoroughly.You must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of
moisture and thus discover the place of exit.Around the caterpillar, who is not always quite dead and who sometimes
even goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer, the vermin at once
begin to work at their cocoons.The straw- thread, drawn from
the silk-glands by a backward jerk of the head, is first fixed to the
white network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warp-beams,
so that, by mutual entanglements, the individual works are welded
together and form an agglomeration in which each of the grubs has its
own cabin.For the moment, what is woven is not the real cocoon, but a
general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the
separate shells.All these frames rest upon those adjoining and, mixing
up their threads, become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a
shelter for itself.Here at last the real cocoon is spun, a pretty
little piece of closely-woven work.In my rearing-jars I obtain as many groups of these tiny shells as my
future experiments can wish for.Three-fourths of the caterpillars have
supplied me with them, so ruthless has been the toll of the spring
births.I lodge these groups, one by one, in separate glass tubes, thus
forming a collection on which I can draw at will, while, in view of my
experiments, I keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one
caterpillar.The adult Microgaster appears a fortnight later, in the middle of June.The riotous multitude is in
the full enjoyment of the pairing-season, for the two sexes always
figure among the guests of any one caterpillar.The carnival of these pigmies bewilders the observer and
makes his head swim.Most of the females, wishful of liberty, plunge down to the waist
between the glass of the tube and the plug of cotton-wool that closes
the end turned to the light; but the lower halves remain free and form
a circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another, take
one another's places and hastily operate.Each bides his turn, each
attends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for
his rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere.The turbulent wedding
lasts all the morning and begins afresh next day, a mighty throng of
couples embracing, separating and embracing once more.There is every reason to believe that, in gardens, the mated ones,
finding themselves in isolated couples, would keep quieter.Here, in
the tube, things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too
numerous for the narrow space.Apparently a little food, a
few sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers.I serve up some
provisions in the tubes: not drops of honey, in which the puny
creatures would get stuck, but little strips of paper spread with that
dainty.They come to them, take their stand on them and refresh
themselves.With this diet,
renewed as the strips dry up, I can keep them in very good condition
until the end of my inquisition.The colonists in my spare
tubes are restless and quick of flight; they will have to be
transferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of
a good number, or even the whole lot, a loss which my hands, my forceps
and other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the
nimble movements of the tiny prisoners.The irresistible attraction of
the sunlight comes to my aid.If I lay one of my tubes horizontally on
the table, turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window,
the captives at once make for the brighter end and play about there for
a long while, without seeking to retreat.If I turn the tube in the
opposite direction, the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and
collects at the other end.With this bait, I can send it whithersoever I please.We will therefore place the new receptacle, jar or test-tube, on the
table, pointing the closed end towards the window.At its mouth, we
open one of the full tubes.No other precaution is needed: even though
the mouth leaves a large interval free, the swarm hastens into the
lighted chamber.All that remains to be done is to close the apparatus
before moving it.The observer is now in control of the multitude,
without appreciable losses, and is able to question it at will.We will begin by asking:

"How do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar?"This question and others of the same category, which ought to take
precedence of everything else, are generally neglected by the impaler
of insects, who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for
glorious realities.He classifies his subjects, dividing them into
regiments with barbarous labels, a work which seems to him the highest
expression of entomological science.Names, nothing but names: the rest
hardly counts.The persecutor of the Pieris used to be called
Microgaster, that is to say, little belly: to-day she is called
Apanteles, that is to say, the incomplete.Can our friend at least tell us how "the Little Belly" or "the
Incomplete" gets into the caterpillar?A book which,
judging by its recent date, should be the faithful echo of our actual
knowledge, informs us that the Microgaster inserts her eggs direct into
the caterpillar's body.It goes on to say that the parasitic vermin
inhabit the chrysalis, whence they make their way out by perforating
the stout horny wrapper.Hundreds of times have I witnessed the exodus
of the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons; and the exit has always
been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the
armour of the chrysalis.The fact that its mouth is a mere clinging
pore, deprived of any offensive weapon, would even lead me to believe
that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalid's covering.This proved error makes me doubt the other proposition, though logical,
after all, and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of
parasites.No matter: my faith in what I read in print is of the
slightest; I prefer to go straight to facts.Before making a statement
of any kind, I want to see, what I call seeing.It is a slower and more
laborious process; but it is certainly much safer.I will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the
cabbages in the garden: that method is too uncertain and besides does
not lend itself to precise observation.As I have in hand the necessary
materials, to wit, my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites
newly hatched into the adult form, I will operate on the little table
in my animals' laboratory.A jar with a capacity of about a litre
(About 1 3/4 pints, or.22 gallon.--Translator's Note.)is placed on
the table, with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun.I put
into it a cabbage-leaf covered with caterpillars, sometimes fully
developed, sometimes half-way, sometimes just out of the egg.A strip
of honeyed paper will serve the Microgaster as a dining room, if the
experiment is destined to take some time.Lastly, by the method of
transfer which I described above, I send the inmates of one of my tubes
into the apparatus.Once the jar is closed, there is nothing left to do
but to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch, for
days and weeks, if need be.The caterpillars graze placidly, heedless of their terrible attendants.If some giddy-pates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars'
spines, these draw up their fore-part with a jerk and as suddenly lower
it again; and that is all: the intruders forthwith decamp.Nor do the
latter seem to contemplate any harm: they refresh themselves on the
honey-smeared strip, they come and go tumultuously.Their short flights
may land them, now in one place, now in another, on the browsing herd,
but they pay no attention to it.What we see is casual meetings, not
deliberate encounters.In vain I change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age; in vain
I change the squad of parasites; in vain I follow events in the jar for
long hours, morning and evening, both in a dim light and in the full
glare of the sun: I succeed in seeing nothing, absolutely nothing, on
the parasite's side, that resembles an attack.No matter what the
ill-informed authors say--ill-informed because they had not the
patience to see for themselves--the conclusion at which I arrive is
positive: to inject the germs, the Microgaster never attacks the
caterpillars.The invasion, therefore, is necessarily effected through the
Butterfly's eggs themselves, as experiment will prove.My broad jar
would tell against the inspection of the troop, kept at too great a
distance by the glass enclosure, and I therefore select a tube an inch
wide.I place in this a shred of cabbage-leaf, bearing a slab of eggs,
as laid by the Butterfly.I next introduce the inmates of one of my
spare vessels.A strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new
arrivals.Soon, the females are there, fussing about,
sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs.They inspect the treasure, flutter their wings and brush their
hind-legs against each other, a sign of keen satisfaction.They sound
the heap, probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the
individual eggs with their palpi; then, this one here, that one there,
they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected.Each
time, we see a slender, horny prickle darting from the ventral surface,
close to the end.This is the instrument that deposits the germ under
the film of the egg; it is the inoculation-needle.The operation is
performed calmly and methodically, even when several mothers are
working at one and the same time.Where one has been, a second goes,
followed by a third, a fourth and others yet, nor am I able definitely
to see the end of the visits paid to the same egg.Each time, the
needle enters and inserts a germ.It is impossible, in such a crowd, for the eye to follow the successive
mothers who hasten to lay in each; but there is one quite practicable
method by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a
single egg, which is, later, to open the ravaged caterpillars and count
the grubs which they contain.A less repugnant means is to number the
little cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar.The total will
tell us how many germs were injected, some by the same mother returning
several times to the egg already treated, others by different mothers.Well, the number of these cocoons varies greatly.Generally, it
fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty, but I have come across as
many as sixty-five; and nothing tells me that this is the extreme
limit.What hideous industry for the extermination of a Butterfly's
progeny!I am fortunate at this moment in having a highly-cultured visitor,
versed in the profundities of philosophic thought.I make way for him
before the apparatus wherein the Microgaster is at work.For an hour
and more, standing lens in hand, he, in his turn, looks and sees what I
have just seen; he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other,
make their choice, draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream
of passers-by, one after the other, have already pricked.Thoughtful
and a little uneasy, he puts down his lens at last.Never had he been
vouchsafed so clear a glimpse as here, in my finger-wide tube, of the
masterly brigandage that runs through all life down to that of the very
smallest.Apanteles, see Microgaster glomeratus.Arundo donax, the great reed.Burying-beetles: method of burial.Cabbage Butterfly, her selection of suitable Cruciferae.Calliphora vomitaria, see Bluebottle.Cetonia, or Rose-chafer.Clairville on the Burying-beetle.Cruciferae, the diet of Pieris brassicae.Epeira, Angular, telegraph wire of.nest of E. pomiformis.prey found in nest of E.

as a forfeit to his temerity.The next morning, at sunrise, was fixed for his death.He was to be
sacrificed upon the altar, on the summit of the great Teocallis--an
offering to _Quetzalcohuatl_, the first great prince of the Aztecs.I at
once determined to save the life of the stranger, if I could do so, even
at the hazard of my own.I retired
earlier than usual, and lay silent and moody, revolving on the best
means to accomplish my end.Midnight at length arrived; I crept stealthily from my bed, and opened

few steps, I fell into the trail leading toward the modern village of
Palenque, and, after an hour's walk, I halted in front of the _cabilda_
of the town.I was followed by a motley crowd to the office of the Alcalde, who did
not recognize me, dressed as I was in skins, and half loaded down with
rolls of MS., made from the bark of the mulberry.I related to him and
M. de Bourbourg my adventures; and though the latter declared he had
lost poor Armand and his five companions, yet I am persuaded that
neither of them credited a single word of my story.Not many days after my safe arrival at Palenque, I seized a favorable
opportunity to visit the ruins of _Casa Grande_.I readily found the
opening to the subterranean passage heretofore described, and after some
troublesome delays at the various landing-places, I finally succeeded in
reaching the very spot whence I had ascended on that eventful night,
nearly three years before, in company with the Aztec Princess.After exploring many of the mouldering and half-ruined apartments of
this immense palace, I accidentally entered a small room, that at first
seemed to have been a place of sacrifice; but, upon closer inspection, I
ascertained that, like many of those in the "Living City," it was a
chapel dedicated to the memory of some one of the princes of the Aztec
race.In order to interpret the inscriptions with greater facility, I lit six
or seven candles, and placed them in the best positions to illuminate
the hieroglyphics.Then turning, to take a view of the grand tablet in
the middle of the inscription, my astonishment was indescribable, when I
beheld the exact features, dress and _panache_ of the Aztec maiden,
carved in the everlasting marble before me._THE MOTHER'S EPISTLE._


    Sweet daughter, leave thy tasks and toys,
      Throw idle thoughts aside,
    And hearken to a mother's voice,
      That would thy footsteps guide;
    Though far across the rolling seas,
      Beyond the mountains blue,
    She sends her counsels on the breeze,
      And wafts her blessings too.To guard thy voyage o'er life's wave,
      To guide thy bark aright,
    To snatch thee from an early grave,
      And gild thy way with light,
    Thy mother calls thee to her side,
      And takes thee on her knee,
    In spite of oceans that divide,
      And thus addresses thee:


                   I.

    Learn first this lesson in thy youth,
      Which time cannot destroy,
    To love and speak and act the truth--
      'Tis life's most holy joy;
    Wert thou a queen upon a throne,
      Decked in each royal gem,
    This little jewel would alone
      Outshine thy diadem.Next learn to conquer, as they rise,
      Each wave of passion's sea;
    Unchecked, 'twill sweep the vaulted skies,
      And vanquish heaven and thee;
    Lashed on by storms within thy breast,
      These billows of the soul
    Will wreck thy peace, destroy thy rest,
      And ruin as they roll!But conquered passions were no gain,
      Unless where once they grew
    There falls the teardrop, like the rain,
      And gleams the morning dew;
    Sow flowers within thy virgin heart,
      That spring from guileless love;
    Extend to each a sister's part,
      Take lessons of the dove.But, daughter, empty were our lives,
      And useless all our toils,
    If that within us, which survives
      Life's transient battle-broils,
    Were all untaught in heavenly lore,
      Unlearned in virtue's ways,
    Ungifted with religion's store,
      Unskilled our God to praise.V.

    Take for thy guide the Bible old,
      Consult its pages fair
    Within them glitter gems and gold,
      Repentance, Faith, and Prayer;
    Make these companions of thy soul;
      Where e'er thy footsteps roam,
    And safely shalt thou reach thy goal,
      In heaven--the angel's home!_LEGENDS OF LAKE BIGLER._


I.--THE HAUNTED ROCK.A great many years ago, ere the first white man had trodden the soil of
the American continent, and before the palaces of Uxmal and Palenque
were masses of shapeless ruins--whilst the splendid structures, now
lining the banks of the Gila with broken columns and fallen domes were
inhabited by a nobler race than the cowardly Pimos or the Ishmaelitish
Apaches, there lived and flourished on opposite shores of Lake Bigler
two rival nations, disputing with each other for the supremacy of this
inland sea, and making perpetual war in order to accomplish the object
of their ambition.The tribe dwelling upon the western shore was called the Ako-ni-tas,
whilst those inhabiting what is now the State of Nevada were known by
the name of Gra-so-po-itas.Each nation was subdivided into smaller
principalities, over which subordinate sachems, or chiefs, presided.In
number, physical appearance, and advance in the arts of civilization,
both very much resembled, and neither could be said to have decidedly
the pre-eminence.At the time my story commences, Wan-ta-tay-to was principal chief or
king of the Ako-ni-tas, or, as they were sometimes designated,
O-kak-o-nitas, whilst Rhu-tog-au-di presided over the destinies of the
Gra-so-po-itas.The language spoken by these tribes were dialects of
the same original tongue, and could be easily understood the one by the
other.Continued intercourse, even when at war, had assimilated their
customs, laws and religion to such a degree that it often became a
matter of grave doubt as to which tribe occasional deserters belonged.Intermarriage between the tribes was strictly forbidden, and punished
with death in all cases, no matter what might be the rank, power or
wealth of the violators of the law.At this era the surface of the lake was about sixty feet higher than at
the present time.Constant evaporation, or perhaps the wearing channel
of the Truckee, has contributed to lower the level of the water, and the
same causes still continue in operation, as is clearly perceptible by
the watermarks of previous years.Thousands of splendid canoes
everywhere dotted its surface; some of them engaged in the peaceful
avocations of fishing and hunting, whilst the large majority were manned
and armed for immediate and deadly hostilities.The year preceding that in which the events occurred herein related, had
been a very disastrous one to both tribes.A great many deaths had
ensued from casualties in battle; but the chief source of disaster had
been a most terrific hurricane, which had swept over the lake,
upsetting, sinking, and destroying whole fleets of canoes, with all
persons aboard at the time.Amongst the lost were both the royal barges,
with the sons and daughters of the chiefs.The loss had been so
overwhelming and general that the chief of the O-kak-o-nitas had but one
solitary representative of the line royal left, and that was a beloved
daughter named Ta-kem-ena.The rival chieftain was equally unfortunate,
for his entire wigwam had perished with the exception of Mo-ca-ru-po,
his youngest son.But these great misfortunes, instead of producing
peace and good-will, as a universal calamity would be sure to do in an
enlightened nation, tended only to embitter the passions of the hostile
kings and lend new terrors to the war.At once made aware of what the
other had suffered, each promulgated a sort of proclamation, offering an
immense reward for the scalp of his rival's heir.Wan-ta-tay-to declared that he would give one half his realm to
whomsoever brought the body of Mo-ca-ru-po, dead or alive, within his
lines; and Rhu-tog-au-di, not to be outdone in extravagance, registered
an oath that whosoever captured Ta-kem-ena, the beautiful daughter of
his enemy, should be rewarded with her patrimonial rights, and also be
associated with him in ruling his own dominions.As is universally the case with all American Indians, the females are
equally warlike and sometimes quite as brave as the males.Ta-kem-ena
was no exception to this rule, and she accordingly made instant
preparations to capture or kill the heir to the throne of her enemy.For
this purpose she selected a small, light bark canoe, and resolved all
alone to make the attempt.Nor did she communicate her intention to any
one else.Her father, even, was kept in profound ignorance of his
daughter's design.About the same time, a desire for fame, and a thirsting for supreme
power, allured young Mo-ca-ru-po into the lists of those who became
candidates for the recent reward offered by his father.He, too,
determined to proceed alone.It was just at midnight, of a beautiful moonlight evening, that the
young scions of royalty set forth from opposite shores of the lake, and
stealthily paddled for the dominions of their enemies.When about half
across the boats came violently into collision.The light of the full moon, riding at mid-heavens,
fell softly upon the features of the Princess, and at the same time
illuminated those of the young Prince.The blows from the uplifted battle-axes failed to descend.The poisoned
arrows were returned to their quivers.Surprise gave place quickly to
admiration--that to something more human--pity followed close in the
rear, and love, triumphant everywhere, paralyzed the muscles, benumbed
the faculties, and captured the souls of his victims.Pouring a handful
of the pure water of the lake upon each other's heads, as a pledge of
love, and a ceremonial of marriage, in another moment the two were
locked in each other's arms, made man and wife by the yearnings of the
soul, and by a destiny which naught but Omnipotent Power could avert.What were the commands of kings, their threats, or their punishments, in
the scale with youth, and hope, and love?Never did those transparent waters leap more lightly beneath the
moonbeams than upon this auspicious night.Hate, revenge, fame, power,
all were forgotten in the supreme delights of love.Who, indeed, would not be a lover?The future takes the hue of the
rainbow, and spans the whole earth with its arch.The past fades into
instant oblivion, and its dark scenes are remembered no more.Every
beautiful thing looks lovelier--spring's breath smells sweeter--the
heavens bend lower--the stars shine brighter.The eyes, the lips, the
smiles of the loved one, bankrupt all nature.The diamond's gleam, the
flower's blush, the fountain's purity, are all _her_ own!The antelope's
swiftness, the buffalo's strength, the lion's bravery, are but the
reflex of _his_ manly soul!Fate thus had bound these two lovers in indissoluble bonds: let us now
see what it had left in reserve.The plashing of paddles aroused the lovers from their caressing.Quickly
leaping into his own boat, side by side, they flew over the exultant
waves, careless for the moment whither they went, and really aimless in
their destination.Having safely eluded their pursuers, if such they
were, the princes now consulted as to their future course.After long
and anxious debate it was finally determined that they should part for
the present, and would each night continue to meet at midnight at the
majestic rock which towered up from the waves high into the heavens, not
far from what is now known as Pray's Farm, that being the residence and
headquarters of the O-kak-oni-ta tribe.Accordingly, after many protestations of eternal fidelity, and warned by
the ruddy gleam along the eastern sky, they parted.Night after night, for many weeks and months, the faithful lovers met at
the appointed place, and proved their affection by their constancy.They
soon made the discovery that the immense rock was hollow, and contained
a magnificent cave.Here, safe from all observation, the tardy months
rolled by, both praying for peace, yet neither daring to mention a
termination of hostilities to their sires.Finally, the usual
concomitants of lawful wedlock began to grow manifest in the rounded
form of the Princess--in her sadness, her drooping eyes, and her
perpetual uneasiness whilst in the presence of her father.Not able any
longer to conceal her griefs, they became the court scandal, and she
was summoned to the royal presence and required to name her lover.This,
of course, she persisted in refusing, but spies having been set upon her
movements, herself and lover were surrounded and entrapped in the fatal
cave.In vain did she plead for the life of the young prince, regardless of
her own.An embassador was sent to Rhu-tog-au-di,
announcing the treachery of his son, and inviting that chief to be
present at the immolation of both victims.He willingly consented to
assist in the ceremonies.A grand council of the two nations was
immediately called, in order to determine in what manner the death
penalty should be inflicted.After many and grave debates, it was
resolved that the lovers should be incarcerated in the dark and gloomy
cave where they had spent so many happy hours, and there starve to
death.It was a grand gala-day with the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas.The mighty chiefs had been reconciled, and the wealth, power and beauty
of the two realms turned out in all the splendor of fresh paint and
brilliant feathers, to do honor to the occasion.The young princes were
to be put to death.The lake in the vicinity of the rock was alive with
canoes.The hills in the neighborhood were crowded with spectators.The
two old kings sat in the same splendid barge, and followed close after
the bark canoe in which the lovers were being conveyed to their living
tomb.Silently they gazed into each other's faces and smiled.For each
other had they lived; with one another were they now to die.Without
food, without water, without light, they were hurried into their bridal
chamber, and huge stones rolled against the only entrance.Evening after evening the chiefs sat upon the grave portals of their
children.At first they were greeted with loud cries, extorted by the
gnawing of hunger and the agony of thirst.Gradually the cries gave way
to low moans, and finally, after ten days had elapsed, the tomb became
as silent as the lips of the lovers.Then the huge stones were, by the
command of the two kings, rolled away, and a select body of warriors
ordered to enter and bring forth their lifeless forms.But the west wind
had sprung up, and just as the stones were taken from the entrance, a
low, deep, sorrowful sigh issued from the mouth of the cave.Startled
and terrified beyond control, the warriors retreated hastily from the
spot; and the weird utterances continuing, no warriors could be found
brave enough to sound the depths of that dreadful sepulchre.Day after
day canoes crowded about the mouth of the cave, and still the west wind
blew, and still the sighs and moans continued to strike the souls of the
trembling warriors.In paddling past they would
always veer their canoes seaward, and hurry past with all the speed they
could command.Centuries passed away; the level of the lake had sunk many feet; the
last scions of the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas had mouldered
many years in the burying-grounds of their sires, and a new race had
usurped their old hunting grounds.Still no one had ever entered the
haunted cave.One day, late in the autumn of 1849, a company of emigrants on their way
to California, were passing, toward evening, the month of the cavern,
and hearing a strange, low, mournful sigh, seeming to issue thence, they
landed their canoe and resolved to solve the mystery.Lighting some
pitch-pine torches, they proceeded cautiously to explore the cavern.For
a long time they could discern nothing.At length, in the furthest
corner of the gloomy recess, they found two human skeletons, with their
bony arms entwined, and their fleshless skulls resting upon each other's
bosoms.The lovers are dead, but the old cave still echoes with their
dying sobs.II.--DICK BARTER'S YARN; OR, THE LAST OF THE MERMAIDS.Well, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having sailed the seas for
more than forty-nine years, and being entirely unaccustomed to living
upon the land.By some accident or other, I found myself, in the winter
of 1849, cook for a party of miners who were sluicing high up the North
Fork of the American.We had a hard time all winter, and when spring
opened, it was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should cross
the summit and spend a week fishing at the lake.We took along an old
Washoe Indian, who spoke Spanish, as a guide.This old man had formerly
lived on the north margin of the lake, near where Tahoe City is now
situated, and was perfectly familiar with all the most noted fishing
grounds and chief points of interest throughout its entire circuit.We had hardly got started before he commenced telling us of a remarkable
struggle, which he declared had been going on for many hundred years
between a border tribe of Indians and the inhabitants of the lake, whom
he designated as Water-men, or "_hombres de las aguas_."On asking if he
really meant to say that human beings lived and breathed like fish in
Lake Bigler, he declared without any hesitation that such was the fact;
that he had often seen them; and went on to describe a terrific combat
he witnessed a great many years ago, between a Pol-i-<DW76> chief and _a
man of the water_.On my expressing some doubt as to the veracity of the
statement, he proffered to show us the very spot where it occurred; and
at the same time expressed a belief that by manufacturing a whistle from
the bark of the mountain chinquapin, and blowing it as the Pol-i-<DW76>s
did, we might entice some of their old enemies from the depths of the
lake.My curiosity now being raised tip-toe, I proceeded to interrogate
Juan more closely, and in answer I succeeded in obtaining the following
curious particulars:

The tribe of border Indians called the Pol-i-<DW76>s were a sort of
amphibious race, and a hybrid between the Pi-Utes and the mermaids of
the lake.They were of a much lighter color than their progenitors, and
were distinguished by a great many peculiar characteristics.Exceedingly
few in number, and quarrelsome in the extreme, they resented every
intrusion upon the waters of the lake as a personal affront, and made
perpetual war upon neighboring tribes.Hence, as Juan remarked, they
soon became extinct after the invasion of the Washoes.The last of them
disappeared about twenty-five years ago.The most noted of their
peculiarities were the following:

First.Their heads were broad and extremely flat; the eyes protuberant,
and the ears scarcely perceptible--being a small opening closed by a
movable valve shaped like the scale of a salmon.Their mouths were very
large, extending entirely across the cheeks, and bounded by a hard rim
of bone, instead of the common lip.In appearance, therefore, the head
did not look unlike an immense catfish head, except there were no fins
about the jaws, and no feelers, as we call them.Their necks were short, stout, and chubby, and they possessed
the power of inflating them at will, and thus distending them to two or
three times their ordinary size.Their bodies were long, round, and flexible.When wet, they
glistened in the sun like the back of an eel, and seemed to possess much
greater buoyancy than those of common men.But the greatest wonder of
all was a kind of loose membrane, that extended from beneath their
shoulders all the way down their sides, and connected itself with the
upper portion of their thighs.This loose skin resembled the wings of
the common house bat, and when spread out, as it always did in the
water, looked like the membrane lining of the legs and fore feet of the
chipmunk.The hands and feet were distinguished for much greater length of
toe and finger; and their extremities grew together like the toes of a
duck, forming a complete web betwixt all the fingers and toes.The Pol-i-<DW76>s lived chiefly upon fish and oysters, of which there was
once a great abundance in the lake.They were likewise cannibals, and
ate their enemies without stint or compunction.A young Washoe girl was
considered a feast, but a lake maiden was the _ne plus ultra_ of
luxuries.The Washoes reciprocated the compliment, and fattened upon the
blubber of the Pol-i-<DW76>s.It is true that they were extremely difficult
to capture, for, when hotly pursued, they plunged into the lake, and by
expert swimming and extraordinary diving, they generally managed to
effect their escape.Juan having exhausted his budget concerning the Pol-i-<DW76>s, I requested
him to give us as minute a description of the Lake Mermaids.This he
declined for the present to do, alleging as an excuse that we would
first attempt to capture, or at least to see one for ourselves, and if
our hunt was unsuccessful, he would then gratify our curiosity.It was some days before we came in sight of this magnificent sheet of
water.Finally, however, after many perilous adventures in descending
the Sierras, we reached the margin of the lake.Our first care was to
procure trout enough to last until we got ready to return.That was an
easy matter, for in those days the lake was far more plentifully
supplied than at present.We caught many thousands at a place where a
small brook came down from the mountains, and formed a pool not a great
distance from its entrance into the lake, and this pool was alive with
them.It occupied us but three days to catch, clean, and sun-dry as many
as our single mule could carry, and having still nearly a week to spare
we determined to start off in pursuit of the mermaids.Our guide faithfully conducted us to the spot where he beheld the
conflict between the last of the Pol-i-<DW76>s and one of the water-men.As
stated above, it is nearly on the spot where Tahoe City now stands.The
battle was a fierce one, as the combatants were equally matched in
strength and endurance, and was finally terminated only by the
interposition of a small party of Washoes, our own guide being of the
number.The struggle was chiefly in the water, the Pol-i-<DW76> being
better able to swim than the mermaid was to walk.Still, as occasion
required, a round or two took place on the gravelly beach.Never did old
Spain and England engage in fiercer conflict for the dominion of the
seas, than now occurred between Pol-i-<DW76> and Merman for the mastery of
the lake.Each fought, as the Roman fought, for Empire.The Pol-i-<DW76>,
like the last of the Mohicans, had seen his tribe melt away, until he
stood, like some solitary column at Persepolis, the sole monument of a
once gorgeous temple.The water chieftain also felt that upon his arm,
or rather tail, everything that made life desirable was staked.Above
all, the trident of his native sea was involved.The weapons of the Pol-i-<DW76> were his teeth and his hind legs.Those of
the Merman were all concentrated in the flop of his scaly tail.With the
energy of a dying alligator, he would encircle, with one tremendous
effort, the bruised body of the Pol-i-<DW76>, and floor him beautifully on
the beach.Recovering almost instantly, the Pol-i-<DW76> would seize the
Merman by the long black hair, kick him in the region of the stomach,
and grapple his windpipe between his bony jaws, as the mastiff does the
infuriated bull.Finally, after a great many unsuccessful attempts to drag the Pol-i-<DW76>
into deep water, the mermaid was seized by her long locks and suddenly
jerked out upon the beach in a very battered condition.At this moment,
the Washoes with a yell rushed toward the combatants, but the Pol-i-<DW76>
seeing death before him upon water and land equally, preferred the
embraces of the water nymphs to the stomachs of the landsmen, and
rolling over rapidly was soon borne off into unfathomable depths by the
triumphant Merman.It resembled the condition of the ancient
Britons, who, being crowded by the Romans from the sea, and attacked by
the Picts from the interior, lamented their fate as the most unfortunate
of men."The Romans," they said, "drive us into the land; there we are
met by the Picts, who in turn drive us into the sea.Those whom enemies spare, the waves devour."Our first step was to prepare a chinquapin whistle.The flute was easily
manufactured by Juan himself, thuswise: He cut a twig about eighteen
inches in length, and not more than half an inch in diameter, and
peeling the bark from the ends an inch or so, proceeded to rub the bark
rapidly with a dry stick peeled perfectly smooth.In a short time the
sap in the twig commenced to exude from both ends.Then placing the
large end between his teeth he pulled suddenly, and the bark slipped off
with a crack in it.Then cutting a small hole in the form of a
parallelogram, near the upper end, he adjusted a stopper with flattened
surface so as to fit exactly the opening.Cutting off the end of the
stopple even with the bark and filling the lower opening nearly full of
clay, he declared the work was done.As a proof of this, he blew into
the hollow tube, and a low, musical sound was emitted, very flute-like
and silvery.When blown harshly, it could be heard at a great distance,
and filled the air with melodious echoes.Thus equipped, we set out upon our search.The first two days were spent
unsuccessfully.On the third we found ourselves near what is now called
Agate Beach.At this place a small cove indents the land, which sweeps
round in the form of a semi-circle.The shore is literally packed with
agates and crystals.We dug some more than two feet deep in several
places, but still could find no bottom to the glittering floor.They are
of all colors, but the prevailing hues are red and yellow.Here Juan
paused, and lifting his whistle to his lips, he performed a multitude of
soft, gentle airs, which floated across the calm waves like a lover's
serenade breathes o'er the breast of sleeping beauty.We had now entirely circumnavigated the lake, and were on the eve
of despairing utterly, when suddenly we beheld the surface of the lake,
nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore, disturbed violently, as if
some giant whale were floundering with a harpoon in its side.In a
moment more the head and neck of one of those tremendous serpents that
of late years have infested the lake, were uplifted some ten or fifteen
feet above the surface.Almost at the same instant we beheld the head,
face and hair, as of a human being, emerge quickly from the water, and
look back toward the pursuing foe.The truth flashed upon us
instantaneously.Here was a mermaid pursued by a serpent.On they came,
seemingly regardless of our presence, and had approached to within
twenty yards of the spot where we stood, when suddenly both came to a
dead halt.Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his tuneful flute,
and it now became apparent that the notes had struck their hearing at
the same time.To say that they were charmed would but half express
their ecstatic condition.The huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a hundred feet or so,
and never so much as shook the spray from his hide.He looked like
Milton's portrait of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.In perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful mermaiden lifted
her pallid face above the water, dripping with the crystal tears of the
lake, and gathering her long raven locks, that floated like the train of
a meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across her swelling
bosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon her beauteous form.If she were entranced by the music, I was
not less so with her beauty.Presently the roseate hues of a dying
dolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere long a gentle sigh,
as if stolen from the trembling chords of an Eolian harp, issued from
her coral lips.Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full
symphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.My attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious clicking of my
comrade's rifle.Turning around suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his
piece leveled at the unconscious mermaid.But the
warning came too late, for instantaneously the quick report of his rifle
and the terrific shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;
and, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of the water, she
plunged headlong forwards, a corpse.Beholding his prey, powerless
within his grasp, the serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock
my rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with it into the
mysterious caverns of the lake.At this instant, I gave a loud outcry,
as if in pain.On opening my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the
midday sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning some
confounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the rum trade of Jamaica,
and the sloop _Edith Beaty_ was still riding at anchor off the wild
glen, and gazing tranquilly at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of
Lake Bigler.[Decoration]

X._ROSENTHAL'S ELAINE._


    I stood and gazed far out into the waste;
    No dip of oar broke on the listening ear;
    But the quick rippling of the inward flood
    Gave warning of approaching argosy.Adown the west, the day's last fleeting gleam
    Faded and died, and left the world in gloom.Hope hung no star up in the murky east
    To cheer the soul, or guide the pilgrim's way.Black frown'd the heavens, and black the answering earth
    Reflected from her watery wastes the night.Once again
    The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,
    Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,
    Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept
    From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,
    Sailless and voiceless, all!Then I knew
    I stood upon the brink of Time.I saw
    Before me Death's swift river sweep along
    And bear its burden to the grave.One seamew screamed, in solitary woe;
    "Elaine!stole back the echo, weird
    And musical, from off the further shore.Then burst a chorus wild, "Elaine!And gazing upward through the twilight haze,
    Mine eyes beheld King Arthur's phantom Court.There stood the sturdy monarch: he who drove
    The hordes of Hengist from old Albion's strand;
    And, leaning on his stalwart arm, his queen,
    The fair, the false, but trusted Guinevere!And there, like the statue of a demi-god,
    In marble wrought by some old Grecian hand,
    With eyes downcast, towered Lancelot of the Lake.Lavaine and Torre, the heirs of Astolat,
    And he, the sorrowing Sire of the Dead,
    Together with a throng of valiant knights
    And ladies fair, were gathered as of yore,
    At the Round Table of bold Arthur's Court.There, too, was Tristram, leaning on his lance,
    Whose eyes alone of all that weeping host
    Swam not in tears; but indignation burned
    Red in their sockets, like volcanic fires,
    And from their blazing depths a Fury shot
    Her hissing arrows at the guilty pair.Then Lancelot, advancing to the front,
    With glance transfixed upon the canvas true
    That sheds immortal fame on ROSENTHAL,
    Thus chanted forth his Requiem for the Dead:

        Fresh as the water in the fountain,
          Fair as the lily by its side,
        Pure as the snow upon the mountain,
                  Is the angel
                    Elaine!Day after day she grew fairer,
          As she pined away in sorrow, at my side;
        No pearl in the ocean could be rarer
                 Than the angel
                    Elaine!The hours passed away all unheeded,
          For love hath no landmarks in its tide.No child of misfortune ever pleaded
                    In vain
                   To Elaine!Here, where sad Tamesis is rolling
         The wave of its sorrow-laden tide,
       Forever on the air is heard tolling
                   The refrain
                   Of Elaine![Decoration]

XI._THE TELESCOPIC EYE._

A LEAF FROM A REPORTER'S NOTE-BOOK.For the past five or six weeks, rumors of a strange abnormal development
of the powers of vision of a youth named Johnny Palmer, whose parents
reside at South San Francisco, have been whispered around in scientific
circles in the city, and one or two short notices have appeared in the
columns of some of our contemporaries relative to the prodigious _lusus
naturae_, as the scientists call it.Owing to the action taken by the California College of Sciences, whose
members comprise some of our most scientific citizens, the affair has
assumed such importance as to call for a careful and exhaustive
investigation.Being detailed to investigate the flying stories, with regard to the
powers of vision claimed for a lad named John or "Johnny" Palmer, as his
parents call him, we first of all ventured to send in our card to
Professor Gibbins, the President of the California College of Sciences.It is always best to call at the fountain-head for useful information, a
habit which our two hundred thousand readers on this coast can never
fail to see and appreciate.An estimable gentleman of the African
persuasion, to whom we handed our "pasteboard," soon returned with the
polite message, "Yes, sir; _in_.And so we followed our
conductor through several passages almost as dark as the face of the
_cicerone_, and in a few moments found ourselves in the presence of,
perhaps, the busiest man in the city of San Francisco.Without any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired our object in
seeking him and the information we desired."Ah," said he, "that is a
long story.I have no time to go into particulars just now.I am
computing the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the Transit
of Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo.It must be ready before
May, and it requires six months' work to do it correctly.""But," I rejoined, "can't you tell me where the lad is to be found?""And if I did, they will not let you see him.""Let me alone for that," said I, smiling; "a reporter, like love, finds
his way where wolves would fear to tread.""Really, my dear sir," quickly responded the Doctor, "I have no time to
chat this morning.Our special committee submitted its report yesterday,
which is on file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to
publish it until after it has been read in open session of the College,
you may take it to your sanctum, run it over, and clip from it enough to
satisfy the public for the present."Saying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case, took from a
pigeon-hole a voluminous written document tied up with red tape, and
handed it to me, adding, "Be careful!"Seating himself without another
word, he turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the street.Reaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the envelope, and
found it as follows: "Report of Special Committee--Boy
Palmer--Vision--Laws of Light--Filed February 10, 1876--Stittmore,
Sec."Opening the document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate,
and, up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal case I
was after, and regretted the promise made not to publish the entire
report until read in open session of the College.Therefore, I shall be
compelled to give the substance of the report in my own words, only
giving _verbatim_ now and then a few scientific phrases which are not
fully intelligible to me, or susceptible of circumlocution in common
language.The report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and Golson, three of our
ablest medical men, and approved by Professor Smyth, the oculist.So
far, therefore, as authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned,
our readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness of every
fact stated and conclusion reached.The first paragraph of the report gives the name of the child, "John
Palmer, age, nine years, and place of residence, South San Francisco,
Culp Hill, near Catholic Orphan Asylum;" and then plunges at once into
_in medias res_.It appears that the period through which the investigation ran was only
fifteen days; but it seems to have been so thorough, by the use of the
ophthalmoscope and other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets
ought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed in
experiments.Besides, we have superadded a short and minute account of
our own, verifying some of the most curious facts reported, with several
tests proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement of the
scientific committee.To begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by the committee.They were conducted into a small back room, darkened by old blankets
hung up at the window, for the purpose of the total exclusion of
daylight; an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a noted quack
whose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the San Francisco _Truth
Teller_.The lad was reclining upon an old settee, ill-clad and almost
idiotic in expression.As the committee soon ascertained, his mother
only was at home, the father being absent at his customary
occupation--that of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad.She notified
her son of the presence of strangers and he rose and walked with a firm
step toward where the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room.He
shook them all by the hand and bade them good morning.In reply to
questions rapidly put and answered by his mother, the following account
of the infancy of the boy and the accidental discovery of his
extraordinary powers of vision was given:

He was born in the house where the committee found him, nine years ago
the 15th of last January.Nothing of an unusual character occurred until
his second year, when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was
completely blind, his parents never having been suspicious of the fact
before that time, although the mother declared that for some months
anterior to the discovery she had noticed some acts of the child that
seemed to indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness.From this
time forward until a few months ago nothing happened to vary the boy's
existence except a new remedy now and then prescribed by neighbors for
the supposed malady.He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber, and
was never trusted alone out of doors.He grew familiar, by touch and
sound, with the forms of most objects about him, and could form very
accurate guesses of the color and texture of them all.His
conversational powers did not seem greatly impaired, and he readily
acquired much useful knowledge from listening attentively to everything
that was said in his presence.He was quite a musician, and touched the
harmonicon, banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling.He was unusually
sensitive to the presence of light, though incapable of seeing any
object with any degree of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude
light as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision.It was very
strange that up to the time of the examination of the committee, no
scientific examination of the boy's eye had been made by a competent
oculist, the parents contenting themselves with the chance opinions of
visitors or the cheap nostrums of quacks.It is perhaps fortunate for
science that this was the case, as a cure for the eye might have been an
extinction of its abnormal power.On the evening of the 12th of December last (1875), the position of the
child's bed was temporarily changed to make room for a visitor.The bed
was placed against the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with
the window opening at the side of the bed next to the head.The boy was
sent to bed about seven o'clock, and the parents and their visitor were
seated in the front room, spending the evening in social intercourse.The moon rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock, and
shone full in the face of the sleeping boy.Something aroused him from slumber, and when he opened his eyes the
first object they encountered was the round disk of her orb.By some
oversight the curtain had been removed from the window, and probably for
the first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen of night
swimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing hill and bay in effulgent
glory.Uttering a cry, equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in
bed and sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open, finger
pointed, and astonishment depicted on every feature.His sudden, sharp
scream brought his mother to his side, who tried for some moments in
vain to distract his gaze from the object before him.Failing even to
attract notice, she called in her husband and friend, and together they
besought the boy to lie down and go to sleep, but to no avail.Believing
him to be ill and in convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the
point of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a sudden spring, he
escaped from their grasp and ran out the front door.Again he fixed his
unwinking eyes upon the moon, and remained speechless for several
seconds.At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity, he
turned on his mother, who stood wringing her hands in the doorway and
moaning piteously, and exclaimed, "I can see the moon yonder, and it is
so beautiful that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon as I get
up.""So big," he replied, "that I cannot see it all at one glance--as big as
all out of doors.""How far off from you does it seem to be?""About half a car's distance," he quickly rejoined.It may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance had been
measured all his life by the distance from his home to the street-car
station at the foot of the hill.This was about two hundred yards, so
that the reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one hundred
yards from the spectator.The boy then proceeded of his own accord to
give a very minute description of the appearance of objects which he
beheld, corresponding, of course, to his poverty of words with which to
clothe his ideas.His account of things beheld by him was so curious, wonderful and
apparently accurate, that the little group about him passed rapidly from
a conviction of his insanity to a belief no less absurd--that he had
become, in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or "clairvoyant" medium.Such was the final conclusion to which his parents had arrived at the
time of the visit of the scientific committee.He had been classed with
that credulous school known to this century as spiritualists, and had
been visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.The committee having fully examined the boy, and a number of independent
witnesses, as to the facts, soon set about a scientific investigation of
the true causes of of the phenomenon.The first step, of course, was to
examine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope, an invention of
Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a few years ago, by means of which
the depths of this organ can be explored, and the smallest variations
from a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.The mode of using the instrument is as follows: The room is made
perfectly dark; a brilliant light is then placed near the head of the
patient, and the rays are reflected by a series of small mirrors into
his eye, as if they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking
through the central aperture of the instrument, the oculist can examine
the illuminated interior of the eyeball, and perceive every detail of
structure, healthy or morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see
any part of the exterior of the body.No discomfort arises to the organ
examined, and all its hidden mysteries can be studied and understood as
clearly as those of any other organ of the body.This course was taken with John Palmer, and the true secret of his
mysterious power of vision detected in an instant.On applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained in a moment
that the boy's eye was abnormally shaped.A natural, perfect eye is
perfectly round.But the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin,
with large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully dilated
pupil.The effect of the shape was at once apparent.It was utterly
impossible to see any object with distinctness at any distance short of
many thousands of miles.Had the eye been elongated inward, or shaped
like an egg--to as great an extent, the boy would have been effectually
blind, for no combination of lens power could have placed the image of
the object beyond the coat of the retina.In other words, there are two
common imperfections of the human organ of sight; one called _myopia_,
or "near-sightedness;" the _presbyopia_, or "far-sightedness.""The axis being too long," says the report, "in myopic eyes, parallel
rays, such as proceed from distant objects, are brought to a focus at a
point so far in front of the retina, that only confused images are
formed upon it.Such a malformation, constituting an excess of
refractive power, can only be neutralized by concave glasses, which give
such a direction to rays entering the eye as will allow of their being
brought to a focus at a proper point for distant perception.""Presbyopia is the reverse of all this.The antero-posterior axis of
such eyes being too short, owing to the flat plate-like shape of the
ball, their refractive power is not sufficient to bring even parallel
rays to a focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent rays
only.Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate for this quality by
rendering parallel rays convergent; and such glasses, in ordinary cases,
bring the rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,
corresponding to its degree of curvature."But in the case under
examination, no glass or combination of glasses could be invented
sufficiently concave to remedy the malformation.By a mathematical
problem of easy solution, it was computed that the nearest distance from
the unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image could be formed
upon the retina, was two hundred and forty thousand miles, a fraction
short of the mean distance of the moon from the earth; and hence it
became perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute distinctness
whatever was transpiring on the surface of the moon.Such being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by science, the
declaration of the lad assumed a far higher value than the mere dicta of
spiritualists, or the mad ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at
once set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge they could by
frequent and prolonged night interviews with the boy.It was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first satisfactory
experiment was tried, testing beyond all cavil or doubt the powers of
the subject's eye.It was full moon, and that luminary rose clear and
dazzlingly bright.The committee were on hand at an early hour, and the
boy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits.The interview was
secret, and none but the members of the committee and the parents of the
child were present.Of course the first proposition to be settled was
that of the inhabitability of that sphere.This the boy had frequently
declared was the case, and he had on several previous occasions
described minutely the form, size and means of locomotion of the
Lunarians.On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,
what he had before related to his parents and friends, but was more
minute, owing to the greater transparency of the atmosphere and the
experience in expression already acquired.The Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves.They are less in
height, and altogether of a different appearance.When fully grown, they
resemble somewhat a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at the
center or axle.They have four eyes in the head, which is the axle, so
to speak, and all the limbs branch out directly from the center, like
some sea-forms known as "Radiates."They move by turning rapidly like a
wheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air.The children are
undeveloped in form, and are perfectly round, like a pumpkin or orange.As they grow older, they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the
whole body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot wheel.They are of different colors, or nationalities--bright red, orange and
blue being the predominant hues.They
do no work, but sleep every four or five hours.They have no houses, and
need none.They have no clothing, and do not require it.There being no
night on the side of the moon fronting the sun, and no day on the
opposite side, all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some
kind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the sleeping
grounds on the shadow-side of the planet.They do not appear to go very
far over the dark rim, for they reappear in immense platoons in a few
hours, and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface.They
sleep and wake about six times in one ordinary day of twenty-four hours.Their occupations cannot be discerned; they must be totally different
from anything upon the earth.The surface of the moon is all hill and hollow.There are but few level
spots, nor is there any water visible.The atmosphere is almost as
refined and light as hydrogen gas.There is no fire visible, nor are
there any volcanoes.Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be
spent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves into squares,
circles, triangles, and other mathematical figures.No one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.The children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of one family.They seem to spawn like herring or shad, or to
be propagated like bees, from the queen, in myriads.The moment after a mathematical figure is formed, it
is dissolved, and fresh combinations take place, like the atoms in a
kaleidoscope.No other species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the
illuminated face of the moon.The shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all metallic.Vegetable life
nowhere exists; but the forms of some of the shrubs and trees are
exceedingly beautiful.The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,
and they appear to have all acquired their full growth.The ground is
strewn with flowers, but they are all formed of metals--gold, silver,
copper, and tin predominating.But there is a new kind of metal seen
everywhere on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the earth.It is
of a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent.The mountains are
all of bare and burnt granite, and appear to have been melted with fire.The committee called the attention of the boy to the bright "sea of
glass" lately observed near the northern rim of the moon, and inquired
of what it is composed.He examined it carefully, and gave such a minute
description of it that it became apparent at once to the committee that
it was pure mercury or quicksilver.The reason why it has but very
recently shown itself to astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears
close up to the line of demarcation separating the light and shadow upon
the moon's disk; and on closer inspection a distinct cataract of the
fluid--in short, a metallic Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the
night side to the day side of the luminary.It has already filled up a
vast plain--one of the four that exist on the moon's surface--and
appears to be still emptying itself with very great rapidity and volume.It covers an area of five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may
possibly deluge one half the entire surface of the moon.It does not
seem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants, as they were soon
skating, so to speak, in platoons and battalions, over and across it.In
fact, it presents the appearance of an immense park, to which the
Lunarians flock, and disport themselves with great gusto upon its
polished face.One of the most beautiful sights yet seen by the lad was
the formation of a new figure, which he drew upon the sand with his
finger.The central heart was of crimson-<DW52> natives; the one to the right
of pale orange, and the left of bright blue.It was ten seconds in
forming, and five seconds in dispersing.The number engaged in the
evolution could not be less than half a million.Thus has been solved one of the great astronomical questions of the
century.The next evening the committee assembled earlier, so as to get a view of
the planet Venus before the moon rose.It was the first time that the
lad's attention had been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the
liveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of that
resplendent world.It may here be stated that his power of vision, in
looking at the fixed stars, was no greater or less than that of an
ordinary eye.They appeared only as points of light, too far removed
into the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning their
properties.But the committee were doomed to a greater disappointment
when they inquired of the boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus.He
replied, "Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I see nothing
with distinctness."The solution of the difficulty was easily
apprehended, and at once surmised.The focus of the eye was fixed by
nature at 240,000 miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth
being 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to observe that
planet's surface with distinctness.Still she appeared greatly enlarged,
covering about one hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with
unimaginable splendor.Experiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally futile, and the committee
half sorrowfully turned again to the inspection of the moon.The report then proceeds at great length to give full descriptions of
the most noted geographical peculiarities of the lunar surface, and
corrects many errors fallen into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor.Professor Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much better
known to astronomers than the surface of the earth is to geographers;
for there are two zones on the globe within the Arctic and Antarctic
circles, that we can never examine.But every nook and cranny of the
illuminated face of the moon has been fully delineated, examined and
named, so that no object greater than sixty feet square exists but has
been seen and photographed by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la
Ruis' camera and apparatus.As the entire report will be ordered
published at the next weekly meeting of the College, we refrain from
further extracts, but now proceed to narrate the results of our own
interviews with the boy.It was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876, that we ventured
with rather a misgiving heart to approach Culp Hill, and the humble
residence of a child destined, before the year is out, to become the
most celebrated of living beings.We armed ourselves with a pound of
sugar candy for the boy, some _muslin-de-laine_ as a present to the
mother, and a box of cigars for the father.We also took with us a very
large-sized opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller.At
first we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting the cigars,
a qualified negative; and finally, when the muslin and candy were drawn
on the enemy, we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a seat.The boy was pale and restless, and his eyes without bandage or glasses.We soon ingratiated ourself into the good opinion of the whole party,
and henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our investigations.The moon being nearly full, we first of all verified the tests by the
committee.Requesting, then, to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of
inspecting Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in obtaining
the history of the child, which we have given above.The planet Mars being at this time almost in dead opposition to the sun,
and with the earth in conjunction, is of course as near to the earth as
he ever approaches, the distance being thirty-five millions of miles.He
rises toward midnight, and is in the constellation Virgo, where he may
be seen to the greatest possible advantage, being in perigee.Mars is
most like the earth of all the planetary bodies.He revolves on his axis
in a little over twenty-four hours, and his surface is pleasantly
variegated with land and water, pretty much like our own world--the
land, however, being in slight excess.He is, therefore, the most
interesting of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants of the earth.Having all things in readiness, we directed the glass to the planet.Alas, for all our calculations, the power was insufficient to clear away
the obscurity resulting from imperfect vision and short focus.Swallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily made arrangements for
another interview, with a telescope, and bade the family good night.There is but one large telescope properly mounted in the city, and that
is the property and pride of its accomplished owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq.We at once procured an interview with that gentleman, and it was agreed
that on Saturday evening the boy should be conveyed to his residence,
picturesquely situated on Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of
the Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.At the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself presented
ourselves at the door of that hospitable mansion.We were cordially
welcomed, and conducted without further parley into the lofty
observatory on the top of the house.In due time the magnificent tube
was presented at the planet, but it was discovered that the power it was
set for was too low.It was then gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the
full strength of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed
at the eye-glass.One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight told the story!Mars, and its mountains and seas, its rivers, vales, and estuaries, its
polar snow-caps and grassy plains--its inhabitants, palaces, ships,
villages and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and
certainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits of the Sierra
Nevada range, beheld the stupendous panorama of the Sacramento Valley,
and the snow-clad summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.[Decoration]

XII._THE EMERALD ISLE._


    Chaos was ended.From its ruins rolled
    The central Sun, poised on his throne of gold;
    The changeful Moon, that floods the hollow dome
    Of raven midnight with her silvery foam;
    Vast constellations swarming all around,
    In seas of azure, without line or bound,
    And this green globe, rock-ribbed and mountain-crown'd.The eye of God, before His hand had made
    Man in His image, this wide realm surveyed;
    O'er hill and valley, over stream and wood,
    He glanced triumphant, and pronounced it "good."But ere He formed old Adam and his bride,
    He called a shining seraph to His side,
    And pointing to our world, that gleamed afar,
    And twinkled on creation's verge, a star,
    Bade him float 'round this new and narrow span
    And bring report if all were ripe for Man.The angel spread his fluttering pinions fair,
    And circled thrice the circumambient air;
    Quick, then, as thought, he stood before the gate
    Where cherubs burn, and minist'ring spirits wait.Nor long he stood, for God beheld his plume,
    Already tarnished by terrestrial gloom,
    And beck'ning kindly to the flurried aid,
    Said, "Speak your wish; if good, be it obeyed."The seraph raised his gem-encircled hand,
    Obeisance made, at heaven's august command,
    And thus replied, in tones so bold and clear,
    That angels turned and lent a listening ear:
    "Lord of all systems, be they near or far,
    Thrice have I circled 'round yon beauteous Star,
    I've seen its mountains rise, its rivers roll,
    Its oceans sweep majestic to each pole;
    Its floors in mighty continents expand,
    Or dwindle into specs of fairy-land;
    Its prairies spread, its forests stretch in pride,
    And all its valleys dazzle like a bride;
    Hymns have I heard in all its winds and streams,
    And beauty seen in all its rainbow gleams.But whilst the LAND can boast of every gem
    That sparkles in each seraph's diadem;
    Whilst diamonds blaze 'neath dusk Golconda's skies,
    And rubies bleed where Alps and Andes rise;
    Whilst in Brazilian brooks the topaz shines,
    And opals burn in California mines;
    Whilst in the vales of Araby the Blest
    The sapphire flames beside the amethyst:
    The pauper Ocean sobs forever more,
    Ungemm'd, unjeweled, on its wailing shore!""Add music to the song the breakers sing!"The strong-soul'd seraph cried, "I'd make yon sea
    Rival in tone heaven's sweetest minstrelsy;
    I'd plant within the ocean's bubbling tide
    An island gem, of every sea the pride!So bright in robes of ever-living green,
    In breath so sweet, in features so serene,
    Such crystal streams to course its valleys fair,
    Such healthful gales to purify its air,
    Such fertile soil, such ever-verdant trees,
    Angels should name it 'EMERALD OF THE SEAS!'"The seraph paused, and downward cast his eyes,
    Whilst heav'nly hosts stood throbbing with surprise.Again the Lord of all the realms above,
    Supreme in might, but infinite in love,
    With no harsh accent in His tones replied:
    "Go, drop this Emerald in the envious tide!"Quick as the lightning cleaves the concave blue,
    The seraph seized the proffer'd gem, and flew
    Until he reached the confines of the earth,
    Still struggling in the throes of turbid birth;
    And there, upon his self-sustaining wing,
    Sat poised, and heard our globe her matins sing;
    Beheld the sun traverse the arching sky,
    The sister Moon walk forth in majesty;
    Saw every constellation rise and roll
    Athwart the heaven, or circle round the pole.Nor did he move, until our spotted globe
    Had donned for him her morn and evening robe;
    Till on each land his critic eye was cast,
    And every ocean rose, and heav'd, and pass'd;
    Then, like some eagle pouncing on its prey,
    He downward sail'd, through bellowing clouds and spray,
    To where he saw the billows bounding free,
    And dropped the gem within the stormy sea!And would'st thou know, Chief of St.Patrick's band,
    Where fell this jewel from the seraph's hand?What ocean caught the world-enriching prize?Child of Moina, homeward cast your eyes!in the midst of wat'ry deserts wide,
    Behold the EMERALD bursting through the tide,
    And bearing on its ever vernal-sod
    The monogram of seraph, and of God!Its name, the sweetest human lips e'er sung,
    First trembled on an angel's fervid tongue;
    Then chimed AEolian on the evening air,
    Lisped by an infant, in its mother prayer;
    Next roared in war, with battle's flag unfurl'd;
    Now, gemm'd with glory, gather'd through the world!Perfidious Albion, blush with shame:
    It is thy sister's!Once more the seraph stood before the throne
    Of dread Omnipotence, pensive and alone."I dropped the jewel in the flashing tide,"
    The seraph said; but saw with vision keen
    A mightier angel stalk upon the scene,
    Whose voice like grating thunder smote his ear
    And taught his soul the mystery of fear."Because thy heart with impious pride did swell,
    And dared make better what thy God made well;
    Because thy hand did fling profanely down
    On Earth a jewel wrenched from Heaven's bright crown,
    The Isle which thine own fingers did create
    Shall reap a blessing and a curse from fate!"Far in the future, as the years roll on,
    And all the pagan ages shall have flown;
    When Christian virtues, flaming into light,
    Shall save the world from superstition's night;
    Erin, oppress'd, shall bite the tyrant's heel,
    And for a thousand years enslaved shall kneel;
    Her sons shall perish in the field and flood,
    Her daughters starve in city, wold, and wood;
    Her patriots, with their blood, the block shall stain,
    Her matrons fly behind the Western main;
    Harpies from Albion shall her strength consume,
    And thorns and thistles in her gardens bloom.But, curse of curses thine, O!fated land:
    Traitors shall thrive where statesmen ought to stand!But past her heritage of woe and pain,
    A far more blest millennium shall reign;
    Seedlings of heroes shall her exiles be,
    Where'er they find a home beyond the sea;
    Bright paragons of beauty and of truth,
    Her maidens all shall dazzle in their youth;
    And when age comes, to dim the flashing eye,
    Still gems of virtue shall they live, and die!No braver race shall breathe beneath the sun
    Than thine, O!Erin, ere the goal be won.Wherever man shall battle for the right,
    There shall thy sons fall thickest in the fight;
    Wherever man shall perish to be free,
    There shall thy martyrs foremost be!when thy redemption is at hand,
    Soldiers shall swell thy ranks from every land!Heroes shall flock in thousands to thy shore,
    And swear thy soil is FREE FOREVERMORE!Then shall thy harp be from the willow torn,
    And in yon glitt'ring galaxy be borne!Then shall the Emerald change its verdant crest,
    And blaze a Star co-equal with the rest!The sentence pass'd, the doomsman felt surprise,
    For tears were streaming from the seraph's eyes."Weep not for Erin," once again he spoke,
    "But for thyself, that did'st her doom provoke;
    I bear a message, seraph, unto thee,
    As unrelenting in its stern decree.For endless years it is thy fate to stand,
    The chosen guardian of the SHAMROCK land.Three times, as ages wind their coils away,
    Incarnate on yon Island shalt thou stray."First as a Saint, in majesty divine,
    The world shall know thee by this potent sign:
    From yonder soil, where pois'nous reptiles dwell,
    Thy voice shall snake and slimy toad expel.Next as a Martyr, pleading in her cause,
    Thy blood shall flow to build up Albion's laws.Last as a Prophet and a Bard combined,
    Rebellion's fires shall mould thy patriot mind.In that great day, when Briton's strength shall fail,
    And all her glories shiver on the gale;
    When winged chariots, rushing through the sky,
    Shall drop their <DW19>s, blazing as they fly,
    Thy form shall tower, a hero'midst the flames,
    And add one more to Erin's deathless names!"gathered here in state,
    Such is the story of your country's fate.Six thousand years in strife have rolled away,
    Since Erin sprang from billowy surf and spray;
    In that drear lapse, her sons have never known
    One ray of peace to gild her crimson zone.Cast back your glance athwart the tide of years,
    Behold each billow steeped with Erin's tears,
    Inspect each drop that swells the mighty flood,
    Its purple globules smoke with human blood!Come with me now, and trace the seraph's path,
    That has been trodden since his day of wrath.in the year when Attila the Hun
    Had half the world in terror overrun,
    On Erin's shore there stood a noble youth,
    The breath of honor and the torch of truth.His was the tongue that taught the Celtic soul
    Christ was its Saviour, Heaven was its goal!His was the hand that drove subdued away,
    The venom horde that lured but to betray;
    His were the feet that sanctified the sod,
    Erin redeemed, and gave her back to God!The gray old Earth can boost no purer fame
    Than that whose halos gild ST.Twelve times the centuries builded up their store
    Of plots, rebellions, gibbets, tears and gore;
    Twelve times centennial annivers'ries came,
    To bless the seraph in St.In that long night of treach'ry and gloom,
    How many myriads found a martyr's tomb!Beside the waters of the dashing Rhone
    In exile starved the bold and blind TYRONE.Beneath the glamour of the tyrant's steel
    Went out in gloom the soul of great O'NEILL.What countless thousands, children of her loin,
    Sank unanneal'd beneath the bitter Boyne!What fathers fell, what mothers sued in vain,
    In Tredah's walls, on Wexford's gory plain,
    When Cromwell's shaven panders slaked their lust,
    And Ireton's fiends despoiled the breathless dust!Still came no seraph, incarnate in man,
    To rescue Erin from the bandit clan.Still sad and lone, she languished in her chains,
    That clank'd in chorus o'er her martyrs' manes.At length, when Freedom's struggle was begun
    Across the seas, by conq'ring Washington,
    When CURRAN thunder'd, and when GRATTAN spoke,
    The guardian seraph from his slumber woke.Then guilty Norbury from his vengeance fled,
    FITZGERALD fought, and glorious WOLFE TONE bled.Then EMMET rose, to start the battle-cry,
    To strike, to plead, to threaten, and to die!happier in thy doom,
    Though uninscrib'd remains thy seraph tomb,
    Than the long line of Erin's scepter'd foes,
    Whose bones in proud mausoleums repose;
    More noble blood through Emmet's pulses rings
    Than courses through ten thousand hearts of kings!Thus has the seraph twice redeem'd his fate,
    And roamed a mortal through this low estate;
    Again obedient to divine command,
    His final incarnation is at hand.Scarce shall yon sun _five times_ renew the year,
    Ere Erin's guardian Angel shall appear,
    Not as a priest, in holy garb arrayed;
    Not as a patriot, by his cause betray'd,
    Shall he again assume a mortal guise,
    And tread the earth, an exile from the skies.But like the lightning from the welkin hurl'd,
    His eye shall light, his step shall shake the world!Are ye but scions of degenerate slaves?Shall tyrants spit upon your fathers' graves?Is all the life-blood stagnant in your veins?Love ye no music but the clank of chains?Hear ye no voices ringing in the air,
    That chant in chorus wild, _Prepare_, PREPARE!on the winds there comes a prophet sound,--
    The blood of Abel crying from the ground,--
    Pealing in tones of thunder through the world,

    From ev'ry country, to their native soil;
    Exiles of Erin, driven from her sod,
    By foes of justice, mercy, man, and God!AErial chariots spread their snowy wings,
    And drop torpedoes in the halls of kings.On every breeze a thousand banners fly,
    And Erin's seraph swells the battle-cry:--
    "Strike!till proud Albion bows her haughty head!for the bones that fill your mothers' graves!till fair Freedom on the world shall smile![Decoration]

XIII._THE EARTH'S HOT CENTER._


The following extracts from the report of the Hon.John Flannagan,
United States Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,
published in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully
explain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be
too voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated
the hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.HAMILTON FISH,
                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from
   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the
   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I
   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the
   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the
   following circumstantial report:

   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North
   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of
   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming
   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department
   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government
   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition
   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,
   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to
   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for
   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in
   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous
   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward
   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the
   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the
   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and
   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English
   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,
   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the
   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick
   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great
   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,
   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of
   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the
   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the
   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the
   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board
   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each
   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few
   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of
   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie
   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first
   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;
   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present
   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so
   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an
   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of
   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the
   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the
   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were
   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the
   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of
   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated
   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;
   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,
   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the
   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of
   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at
   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the
   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not
   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific
   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at
   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them
   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its
   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal
   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant
   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of
   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being
   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by
   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe
   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated
   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very
   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its
   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten
   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual
   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly
   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being
   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner
   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this
   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most
   prominent:

   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial
   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago
   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most
   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal
   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a
   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of
   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt
   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases
   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the
   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must
   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,
   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining
   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been
   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant
   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this
   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,
   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines
   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one
   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the
   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred
   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at
   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average
   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in
   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and
   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an
   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in
   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one
   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat
   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree
   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of
   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when
   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed
   from a common source; and

   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change
   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less
   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of
   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and
   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of
   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of
   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could
   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of
   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful
contrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only
a portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:

   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten
   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone
   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the
   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise
   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to
   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that
   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to
   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive
   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by
   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.Turbine wheels were built,
   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the
   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between
   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet
   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the
   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the
   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron
   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred
   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of
   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two
   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected
   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron
   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost
   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the
   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons
   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an
   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed
   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of
   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from
   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the
   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the
   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was
   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that
   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the
   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to
   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the
   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen
   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the
   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were
   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio
   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface
   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at
   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As
   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if
   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some
   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was
   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast
   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of
   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of
   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of
   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon
   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the
   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an
   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,
   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the
   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was
   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the
   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the
   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping
   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a
   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st
   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the
   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of
   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the
   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by
   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment
   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a
   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_
   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse
   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the
   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while
   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred
   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one
   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only
   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing
   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a
   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The
   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being
   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But
   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious
   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was
   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it
   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not
   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at
   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
   of the magnetic clock stopped."But the activity of the needle
   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
   theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
   angles to its current."Hence electricity, from the nature of its
   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000
   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic
   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite
   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery
   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,
   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of
   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize
   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was
   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least
   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest
   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found
   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or
   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of
the earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only
truncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the
latitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the
   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover
   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the
   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two
   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a
   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the
   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous
   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured
   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
   floor of the shaft building!The highest peak of the Himalayas is
   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that
   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the
   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November
   1.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages
   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the
   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were
   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from
   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent
   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon
   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went
   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as
   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much
   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible
   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of
   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,
   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials
   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in
   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another
   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more
   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more
   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,
   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A
   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,
   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious
   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one
   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the
   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and
   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and
   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and
   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on
   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty
   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the
   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed
   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire
   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed
   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were
   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and
   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the
   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,
   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it
   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this
   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,
   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted
   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders
   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he
   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded
   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate
   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they
   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,
   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the
   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are
   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a
   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the
   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the
   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils
   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified
   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous
   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was
   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference
   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest
   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could
   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the
   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,
   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the
   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their
   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant
   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the
   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But
   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,
   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from
   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could
   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this
   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost
   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the
   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most
   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose
   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the
   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in
   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the
   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the
   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on
   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff
   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the
   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only
   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,
   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving
   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly
   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a
   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim
   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever
   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active
   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently
   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as
   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being
   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law
   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could
   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from
   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I
   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and
   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw
   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can
   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to
   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts
   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the
   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature
   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their
   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no
   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could
   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he
   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all
   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the
   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up
   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,
   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds
   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply
   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited
   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal
   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then
   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level
   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than
   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich
   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It
   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten
   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when
   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists
   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its
   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the
   close of the session, the members were equally divided between
   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take
   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed
   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as
   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the
   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet
   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about
   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is
   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch
   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and
   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of
   the United States in originating the work that led to the
   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign
   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State
   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum
   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States
   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by
   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,
   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the
   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,
                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did
   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory
   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and
   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his
   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,
   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of
   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the
   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the
   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of
   basalt."The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to
   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the
   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's
   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of
   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great
   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created
   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained
   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as
   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of
   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw
   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a
   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his
   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be
   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected
   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY'S DREAM._


    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,
          Just fifty years ago,
    And struck in his might, to the left and right,
          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star
          Illumined the dusky air,
    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,
          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,
          Just fifty years ago,
    Of the sins that start in the human heart
          When _its_ metal is all aglow;
    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,
          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,
    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs
          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,
          With center in self alone,
    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,
          In the sweep of its mighty zone;
    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,
          He gazed from his swarthy home,
    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,
          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march
          All peoples went wailing by,
    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,
          To the grave that was yawning nigh,
    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows
          On the iron that was aglow,
    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,
          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,
    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;
    Men of all nations, and of every clime,
    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,
    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,
    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band
    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;
    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,
    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,
    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose
    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;
    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,
    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,
    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,
    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,
    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,
    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,
    And bear upon their airy ramparts old
    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade
    All woes and vices had their coverts made;
    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,
    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,
    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,
    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array
    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,
    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,
    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,
    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,
    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;
    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,
    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,
    And happy only amid war's alarms,
    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;
    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,
    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,
    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;
    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,
    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;
    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,
    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,
    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;
    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;
    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;
    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;
    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;
    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,
    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,
    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;
    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,
    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good
      With an angel by his side,
    And rested his sledge on its iron edge
      And blew up his bellows wide;
    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,
      Then murmured in accent low:
    "All ready am I your bidding to try
      So far as a mortal may go."'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,
      And breathed in his softest tone,
    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air
      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask
      Beyond a mortal's control,
    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs
      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth '<DW41> the sons of the earth,
      And bring me a human heart
    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,
      And acts still a brother's part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait
      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;
    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,
      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,
      But plumed for an angel's flight;
    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled
      When the clouds are alive with light;
    He followed the sun till his race was won,
      And probed every heart and mind;
    But in every zone man labored alone
      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,
      The dreamer returned to his home,
    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,
      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught
      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,
      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side
      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;
    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife
      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,
      And sinful my sorrowing heart;
    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,
      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast
      To the angel's glittering blade;
    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide
      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,
      And buried it deep in the flame
    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell
      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs
      That environ the human soul;
    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might
      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,
      Beat the heart that was all aglow,
    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars
      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge
      Of wounds that were healed long ago;
    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm
      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,
      For the angel was holding the heart,
    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought
      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;
    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,
      _But left on the anvil a chain!_
    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,
      As pure as the fountain of youth;
    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,
      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke
      At the anvil that slept by his side;
    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,
      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,
      Our emblem in age and in youth;
    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,
      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._


By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the
vagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of
loveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive
in the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up
to the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the
imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous
truth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as
we unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in
creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the
mighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,
a boiling flood of lava.Time was not;
for as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun
had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure
concave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but
shot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their
horrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of
the waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable
depths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,
destined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the
laws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned
upon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and
water overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and
decomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This
but prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the
groundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of
all her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet
affections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God
calls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his
sway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven
thrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and
anxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous
word--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of
Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the
west, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa
hills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand
problem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea
of silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of
the setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay
like a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at
intervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of
business I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the
night.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my
profession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to
the cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their
thraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought
came back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,
with its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy
came with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her
Napoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her
commerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw
Russell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,
thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a
cross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but
speechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open
on my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would
then pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and
her apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and
went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in
glittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow
encircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud
above of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled
and subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full
review.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no
means uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,
read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide
heavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an
immense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides
I saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its
summit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in
alternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,
_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,
_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,
_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,
_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the
base of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot
upon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and
swarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly
upward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and
I observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second
layer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me
for observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily
recognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he
reached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I
caught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of
the true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,
and that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in
reality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced
from the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with
folded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as
if about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in
distinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen
to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because
unanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral
sound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and
turning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little
school-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I
spoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "'tis time to proceed
homeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the
evening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking
her proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still
ringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #

Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The
candle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering
glimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and
excited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart
and brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now
perceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were
dense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me
howling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving
billows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his
doubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his
poison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all
the great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the
same thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and
as I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and
again--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart
from Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed
her into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are
woven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits
impassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The
light she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the
bright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the
soul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the
scene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its
lessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was
cased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of
an angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my
conscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my
mental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of
the straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the
poor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely
glancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable
passage in one of Paul's epistles: "That was not _first_ which is
spiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is
spiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection
than at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the
horizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that
the past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the
human soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,
and read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul
evidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its
applicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in
philosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;
that man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is
barren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,
he clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science
is demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first
law, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone
forth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up
like a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that
the shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that
poor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in
thought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had
wandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had
been identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually
decipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral
apparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by
mortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of
the mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the
telescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered
by the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to
their bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,
and he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so
long tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most
unwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be
called sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more
powerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst
my eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and
almost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking
song flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose
shadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I
beheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree
which was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the
branches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its
silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,
spreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding
this, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of
Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It
was in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and
the identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the
top.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or
greets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are
whistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many
moments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it
covered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and
fertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then
came forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the
morn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at
Jerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker
than the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of
time it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes
toward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his
position, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to
be floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His
features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression
of superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the
question came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my
lips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again
I read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a
natural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;
gradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that
which transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now
gleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed
as naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets
and apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind
infatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your
own mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the
idea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and
dismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year
allotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as
science elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,
the natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be
changed in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear
the clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the
dark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my
heart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When
the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent
and abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,
but thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its
wings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when
in terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._


                   I.

    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,
      Have bloomed, and passed away,
    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,
      We spent our wedding-day.Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,
      Joy chased each tear of woe,
    When first we promised to be true,
      That morning long ago.Though many cares have come, dear Sue,
      To checker life's career,
    As down its pathway we have trod,
      In trembling and in fear.Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,
      That lowered o'er the way,
    We clung the closer, while it blew,
      And laughed the clouds away.'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,
      And riches we have not,
    But children gambol round our door,
      And consecrate the spot.Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,
      Our daughters fair and gay,
    But none so beautiful as you,
      Upon our wedding-day.No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,
      No crape festooned the door,
    But health has waved its halcyon wings,
      And plenty filled our store.Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,
      And chase dull cares away,
    And kindle rosy hope anew,
      As on our wedding-day.[Decoration]

XVII._THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._


    One more flutter of time's restless wing,
    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;
    One more step in the journey of fate,
    One more ember gone out in life's grate;
    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,
    One more round in the ladder of age;
    One leaf more in the volume of doom,
    And one span less in the march to the tomb,
    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,
    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.How has thy life been speeding
          Since Aurora, at the dawn,
        Peeped within thy portals, leading
          The babe year, newly born?Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,
          Has some spectre nestled there?And with every new to-morrow,
          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?Burst its chain with strength sublime,
        For behold!I bring another,
          And a fairer child of time.Have thy barns been brimming o'er?Will thy stature fit the niches
          Hewn for Hercules of yore?the rolling planet
          Starts on a nobler round.But perhaps across thy vision
          Death had cast its shadow there,
        And thy home, once all elysian,
          Now crapes an empty chair;
        Or happier, thy dominions,
          Spreading broad and deep and strong,
        Re-echo 'neath love's pinions
          To a pretty cradle song!God's blessing on your head;
        Joy for the living mother,
          Peace with the loving dead.[Decoration]

XVIII._A PAIR OF MYTHS:_

BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained unconscious of
everything occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged
heavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose
state.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder
sleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician
with joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss
Lucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused
me from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something
of the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared
as fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my
shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after
my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no
torpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the
occurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had
happened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my
intended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I
was awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I
smiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late
catastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand
times, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,
remembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he
rushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome
intelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild
with joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and
forehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my
chamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the
nurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the
reader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything
around me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when
consciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and
instead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at
my bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she
might select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual
manner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most
implicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark
in relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what
delighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a
manuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its
history.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for
my brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day
came round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral
essays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled


THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old
toper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great
many very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard
of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of
"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the
display of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was
his strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He
had told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled
incessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once
rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to
eat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,
the fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might
accidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very
long fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great
Sahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must
not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the
little town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he
said so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His
companions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and
gazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,
could nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the
pins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal
had a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start
home.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever
heard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down
tremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set
out.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he
had but a boy to talk to!A verse
that he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into
his mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire
its company.It ran thus:

    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin
       The powers upon him shed,
     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]
       And a talk with Mimir's head!"[B-236]

[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could
sail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and
carry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he
desired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,
however, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,
until finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that
it drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and
demanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_
want with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"
politely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head
was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least
forty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in
close proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me
down to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal
said--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it
might, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took
their places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet you an ounce of
your blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don't bet
_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood's my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in
vain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could
spare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's
appetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest
and his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir's head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head
fall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"
etc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar
and set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran
a few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what
was his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the
ball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head
along--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long
before it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled
down, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he
hurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at
once, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he
said so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,
and drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one
scale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he
grasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his
sleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest
vein he could discover.When he returned to
consciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the
giant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum
of blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he
could scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned
immediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,
like some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never
intimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me
in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the
adventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with
one of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in
story telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect
he originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or
drunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat
the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #

In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous
history of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally
wandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who
I now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of
my destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and
whenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,
lay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the
perusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man's pardon for
declaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps
think the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing
to these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the
story, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal
now?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded
whether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush
assured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she
had whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly
unfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious
condition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of
satisfying it."But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy
as Black Hal's.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray
inform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls
never think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus
attempted to elucidate


THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes
involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring
around me.There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being
in the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment
emerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the
star Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of
the comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very
comfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit
ramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by
the song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and
system to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to
those who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of
hospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice
lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what
evidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:

The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above
the gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was
gone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed
the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that
Paradise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and
smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself
along the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the
fountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I
once enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those
beautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have
flown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array
him in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,
produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all
balm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and
the fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness
greet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every
side.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his
companion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,
we are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles
of Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let
us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn
also the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once
wailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled
from the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among
these groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,
sweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling
waters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when
we have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her
side, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on
earth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and
started eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred
times had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had
trod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain
traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In
vain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's
cold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea
which separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the
far-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the
distance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if
Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,
and set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,
with the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her
lip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was
unsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean
soon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,
and the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked
feet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid
seemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every
motion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph
Happiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of
Eden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy
lovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their
bosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;
neither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the
sought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in
the vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou
wilt.This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate."A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her
sleep a vision came to comfort her.She dreamed that she stood before an
aged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom."Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"and then she burst into a
flood of tears."Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the old man; "Happiness yet
dwells on earth, but she is no longer visible.A temple is built for her
in every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed
there by the child of Honor and Love."The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the
memory of her dream."I will return to Eden, and there await until the
child of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and
thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in
verdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the
warbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers
approached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed
through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.A hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had
resounded through the deserted groves.At length the dusky figures
emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into
each other's faces.One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each
other's arms.Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished
hers.But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to
his bosom, exclaimed:

"There is no mystery here, my Eve.If Happiness on earth be indeed the
child of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone.What else now
left us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon?Approved by heaven,
and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;
and if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!"They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though
the garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an
angel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of
Matrimony.[Decoration]

XIX._THE LAST OF HIS RACE._


    No further can fate tempt or try me,
      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;
    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,
      The last of my race I remain.To that home so long left I might journey;
      But they for whose greeting I yearn,
    Are launched on that shadowy ocean
      Whence voyagers never return.My life is a blank in creation,
      My fortunes no kindred may share;
    No brother to cheer desolation,
      No sister to soften by prayer;
    No father to gladden my triumphs,
      No mother my sins to atone;
    No children to lean on in dying--
      I must finish my journey alone!In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,
      How lone would now echo my tread!While each fading portrait threw o'er me
      The chill, stony smile of the dead.One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,
      From eve till the coming of dawn:
    I cry out in visions, "_Where are they_?"And echo responds, "_They are gone_!"But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,
      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,
    That row of green hillocks, where moulder
      The rest of my early doom'd race.There slumber the true and the manly,
      There slumber the spotless and fair;
    And when my last journey is ended,
      My place of repose be it there![Decoration]

XX._THE TWO GEORGES._


Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on
opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert
a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to
control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.It will
be the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two
individuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and
show how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,
whilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with
immortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the
guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of
England.It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734.Some joyful event
must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire.Nor is the circumstance of a
private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is
illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron
throats.The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee.Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on
a commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest
towers of St.James's Palace the national ensigns of St.George and the
Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze.Within one of the most
gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son.The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended.The corridors are thronged with dukes,
and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple
knee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world.A
Royal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding
British subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to
rejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great
Britain and Ireland.Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended
the throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a
scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character.It is the 22d February, 1732.The locality is a distant
colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with
clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards.Snow covers the
ground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning
through the forest.Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the
house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality
within, totally in contrast with external nature.There are but four
small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of
Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son.No dukes or
marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.There are no
princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom.His first
breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden
with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains."But the child is received from its Mother's womb by
hands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,
indicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.He, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took
command of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only
the language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as
caprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.The peasant
boy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was
honorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health.He early
learned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a
stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of
untamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns.Truth,
courage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's
counsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's
example, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over
extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district
surveyor.Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us
now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of either.For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all
the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching
in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana.The English strenuously
denied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,
commenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg
stands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them
from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary
to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and
demand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,
and order him immediately to evacuate the territory.George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by
the Governor for this important mission.It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery
march through the wilderness.The historian of his life has painted in
imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in
the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.The
memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.How
often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on
his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero!with what fervent prayers
do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of
the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.Standing
bareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was
broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling
current.for the destinies of millions yet
unborn hang upon that noble arm!In the early part of the year 1764 a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly
irritated.A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that
the monarch is sick.His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,
and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.Yet he has
no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step
along the corridors of the palace.His conduct becomes gradually more
and more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal
medical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that
the King is threatened with _insanity_.For six weeks the cloud obscures
his mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the
administration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the
future.His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,
and a radical cure impossible.Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and
George Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during
the struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first
indignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a
king.Not long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the
chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the
French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of
lieutenant-colonel.Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he
was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his
own.Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in
Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,
and his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
_under the command of favorite officers_.An
edict soon followed, denominated an "Order to settle the rank of the
officers of His Majesty's forces serving in America."By one of the
articles of this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade
commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their
commissions might be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy
no rank at all."This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the
ink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in
vain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the
defenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly
replied: "I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor."In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp
Act.This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual
resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia.The
leading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barre, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city
of London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the
Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act."It is with the utmost
astonishment," replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects capable
of encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some
of my North American colonies.Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue
those measures which they have recommended for the support of the
constitutional rights of Great Britain."He heeded not the memorable
words of Burke, that afterward became prophetic."There are moments,"
exclaimed this great statesman, "critical moments in the fortunes of all
states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may
yet be strong enough to complete your ruin."The Boston port bill
passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that
George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man
in his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of
cruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the
soul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable
justice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince
England that her revolted colonists were invincible.It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at
the gate of St.James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named
Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of
the King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life.On the 29th
October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,
a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.James the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat.The state carriage was
completely demolished by the mob.But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that
George the Third made his narrowest escapes.In the morning of that
day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one
of the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the
King.The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear.In the evening of the same day a
more alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre.At the
moment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a
large horse-pistol at him.The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown
up by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of
the King.Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on
the 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic.In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the
most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the
English throne.He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was
hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a
despot to the grave.His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,
in few words: "Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to
be his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in
perilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.His interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the
case of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous._The
separation of America from the mother country, at the time it took
place, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference
with the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,
attributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England.His
obstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and
threatened the dismemberment of the kingdom.He has been often praised
for firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of
obstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a
resolution once formed."The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last
resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to
one of light.Let us now return to the career of Washington.Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of
millions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.Honored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from
thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and
best of the world's benefactors.Assassins did not unglory him in life,
nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death.The names of his
great battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have
imbedded themselves forever in the national character.Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory.His mementoes are everywhere
around and about us.Distant as we are from the green fields of his
native Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our
borders.In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on
shores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face
of liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused
perhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,
this day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the
gleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of
heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles
in his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the
enslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice
to his memory.Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in
discharging this debt of national gratitude.With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter
could feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of
purchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel
over his remains.ye daughters
of America; enfold them closer to your bosom than your first-born
offspring; build around them a mausoleum that neither time nor change
can overthrow; for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn.Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan
head, wherever treason shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion
shall unfurl its tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the
hearts of patriots and republicans!For from these pale ashes there
shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the
plains of Heber, vast armies of invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar
and tomb at Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!_MASONRY._


    Oh, sacred spirit of Masonic love,
    Offspring of Heaven, the angels' bond above,
    Guardian of peace and every social tie,
    How deep the sources of thy fountains lie!How wide the realms that 'neath thy wings expand,
    Embracing every clime, encircling every land!Beneath the aurora of the Polar skies,
    Where Greenland's everlasting glaciers rise,
    The Lodge mysterious lifts its snow-built dome,
    And points the brother to a sunnier home;
    Where Nilus slays the sacrificial kid,
    Beneath the shadow of her pyramid,
    Where magian suns unclasp the gaping ground,
    And far Australia's golden sands abound;
    Where breakers thunder on the coral strand,
    To guard the gates of Kamehameha's land;
    Wherever man, in lambskin garb arrayed,
    Strikes in defense of innocence betrayed;
    Lifts the broad shield of charity to all,
    And bends in anguish o'er a brother's fall;
    Where the bright symbol of Masonic truth,
    Alike for high and low, for age or youth,
    Flames like yon sun at tropic midday's call,
    And opes the universal eye on all!What though in secret all your alms be done,
    Your foes all vanquished and your trophies won?What though a veil be o'er your Lodges thrown,
    And brother only be to brother known?In secret, God built up the rolling world;
    In secret, morning's banners are unfurled;
    In secret, spreads the leaf, unfolds the flower,
    Revolve the spheres, and speeds the passing hour.The day is noise, confusion, strife, turmoil,
    Struggles for bread, and sweat beneath the toil.The night is silence--progress without jars,
    The rest of mortals and the march of stars!The day for work to toiling man was given;
    But night, to lead his erring steps to Heaven.Who feed the hungry, heed the orphan's cry;
    Who clothe the naked, dry the widow's tear,
    Befriend the exile, bear the stranger's bier;
    Stand round the bedside when the fluttering soul
    Bursts her clay bonds and parteth for her goal;
    God speed you in the noble path you tread,
    Friends of the living, mourners o'er the dead.May all your actions, measured on the square,
    Be just and righteous, merciful and fair;
    Your thoughts flow pure, in modesty of mind,
    Along the equal level of mankind;
    Your words be troweled to truth's perfect tone,
    Your fame be chiseled in unblemished stone,
    Your hearts be modeled on the plummet's line,
    Your faith be guided by the Book divine;
    And when at last the gavel's beat above
    Calls you from labor to the feast of love,
    May mighty Boaz, pillar'd at that gate
    Which seraphs tyle and where archangels wait,
    Unloose the bandage from your dazzled eyes,
    Spell out the _Password_ to Arch-Royal skies;
    Upon your bosom set the signet steel,
    Help's sign disclose, and Friendship's grip reveal;
    Place in your grasp the soul's unerring rod,
    And light you to the Temple of your God!_POLLOCK'S EUTHANASIA._


    He is gone!By his own strong pinions lifted
                      To the stars;

    Where he strikes, with minstrels olden,
    Choral harps, whose strings are golden,
                      Deathless bars.There, with Homer's ghost all hoary,
    Not with years, but fadeless glory,
                      Lo!he stands;

    And through that open portal,
    We behold the bards immortal
                      Clasping hands!how Rome's great epic master
    Sings, that death is no disaster
                      To the wise;

    Fame on earth is but a menial,
    But it reigns a king perennial
                      In the skies!Albion's blind old bard heroic,
    Statesman, sage, and Christian stoic,
                      Greets his son;

    Whilst in paeans wild and glorious,
    Like his "Paradise victorious,"
                      Sings, Well done!a bard with forehead pendent,
    But with glory's beams resplendent
                      As a star;

    Slow descends from regions higher,
    With a crown and golden lyre
                      In his car.All around him, crowd as minions,
    Thrones and sceptres, and dominions,
                      Kings and Queens;

    Ages past and ages present,
    Lord and dame, and prince and peasant,
                      His demesnes!young bard hesperian,
    Welcome to the heights empyrean,
                      Thou did'st sing,

    Ere yet thy trembling fingers
    Struck where fame immortal lingers,
                      In the string.I am the bard of Avon,
    And the Realm of song in Heaven
                      Is my own;

    Long thy verse shall live in story,
    And thy Lyre I crown with glory,
                      And a throne!_SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY._


Looking back into the past, and exploring by the light of authentic
history, sacred as well as profane, the characteristics of former ages,
the merest tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain epochs
stand prominently out on the "sands of time," and indicate vast activity
and uncommon power in the human mind.These epochs are so well marked that history has given them a
designation, and to call them by their name, conjures up, as by the wand
of an enchanter, the heroic representatives of our race.If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon, in sacred
history, the memory would instantly picture forth the pinnacles of the
Holy Temple, lifting themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen
intently to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David, vocal at
once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and swelling into sublime
ecstasy at the final redemption of his people; the eye would glisten at
the pomp and pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his court,
and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the young Queen of Sheba, who
journeyed from a distant land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne.We should behold his ships
traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of
Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the
East.So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be
giants, and their minds inspired.What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?We mean all that is
glorious in the annals of Greece.We mean Apelles with his pencil,
Phidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword.We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the
divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward
the theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is
presenting his tragedies.Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious
chariot.The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge
in blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us.The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus
and Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,
statesmen, and orators.Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the
greatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest
orator, and the greatest statesman of Rome.Caesar and Cicero, Virgil and
Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their
blended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.Italy and Spain and France and England have had their golden age.The
eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis
Quatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten.They loom up from the
surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;
irradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,
and dimming the lustre of the brightest stars.History has also left in
its track mementoes of a different character.In sacred history we have
the age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero.We recognize at a glance
the talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the
Crusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to
the reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout
Christendom as the "Dark Ages."Let us now take a survey of the field we
occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall
be ranked by our posterity.But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let
us define more especially what that epoch embraces.It does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it
include the acts or heroes of either.The impetus given to the human
mind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth.The
first was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost
uninterrupted peace.The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm
belong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds.Hence the wars of
Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from
observation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.De Stael and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,
Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;
Canova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning
of this century, belong essentially to a former era.They were the
ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first
took form on the 4th day of July, 1776.Our era properly commences with
the downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected
therewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in
the epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period.Ages
hence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of
the nineteenth century:

  "The normal state of Christendom was peace.The age of steel that
  immediately went before it had passed."Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility
  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths
  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly
  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_.The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against
  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new
  trial granted.The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg
  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew
  before the bar of public opinion.The head of Oliver Cromwell was
  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the
  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII
  against the'starry Galileo' reversed forever.Aristotle was
  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In
  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and
  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.Germany led the van, and
  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times."Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present
time, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,
shall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of
bygone generations.Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and
test its accuracy by exemplifications.I. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_?Locke has been
completely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all
speculative moral philosophy exploded.The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr.Wayland in their
discourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,
inquisitively demand, "_Cui bono_?"How can
we apply it to the every-day concerns of life?We ask you for bread and
you have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is
valueless, except for its glitter.No philosopher can speculate
successfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every
turn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who
clips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an
offer of copartnership to "speculate," it may be, in the price of pork.Hence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any
theory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment.Each school
rises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in
toss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its
crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.As with its
predecessor, so with itself."The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages."But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_.It is
true that more books are written and published, more newspapers and
periodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected
and incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any
former period of the world's history.In looking about us we are
forcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--

    "That those who cannot write, and those who can,
     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,
all the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his
eyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and
his years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual
product of the press of Christendom at the present day.It is no figure
of rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its
labors.Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak
out, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to
which they would solemnly respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"A recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating
to the book trade in our own country: "Books have multiplied to such an
extent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000
engines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and
night, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers.These
tireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.It
requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus
340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year.There
are about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000
book-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum
to the public."It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is
declining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful
extent.Byron wrote:

    "'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."True enough; but books are not always literature.A man may become an
author without ceasing to be an ignoramus.His name may adorn a
title-page without being recorded _in aere perenne_.He may attempt to
write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst good master Slender
may be busily engaged "in writing him down an ass."Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand
wreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up
into the region of the immortals.Tell me, ye who prate about the
_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists?Whose
are

    "The great, the immortal names
     That were not born to die?"I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold
hundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals.They
jostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush
onward and upward.One, it may be two, of the million who started out,
stand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for
admittance.One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the
other, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he
enters, is transformed into imperishable stone.Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and
select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen
as it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall
drink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the
sceptre?--who wears the crown?America, England, France and Germany can
boast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single
poet.The _poeta nascitur_ is not here.He may be on his way--and I have
heard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives.Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his "Dove"?Is it Bryant,
with his "Thanatopsis," or Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"?Perhaps it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow, with his
"Idyls."is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is
utterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find
him?True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,
in abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the
everlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the
pet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and
harmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into
sublimity like the storm-swept sea.Beranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere
song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and
lyrist.Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor
Hugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,
Burke or Patrick Henry?I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor
Lamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.But Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a
mere debater, and the spokesman of a party.He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last
century.And in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of
that burly old bully, Dr.and yet Johnson, with all his
learning, was a third-rate philosopher.In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist.Beyond all
controversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of
our times.With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;
with a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a
standard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a
learning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still lacks the giant
grasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest
enthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and
identify them with the eras they adorn.As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the
_Fine Arts_.The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,
or composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua
Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been
superseded by <DW64> minstrelsy and senseless pantomime.The greatest
architect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a
cobbler of French farces.But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has
been left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next
highest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has
been stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact.Within its
chosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have
preceded it.It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors.It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood.It
disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the
manufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an
agricultural experiment.It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no
appreciation of the sublime.It stands upon the ocean shore, but with
its eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold.It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an
ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!"Having no
soul to save, it has no religion to save it.It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,
after all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,
his fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else.It does not
believe in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible.It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the
chronology of the third.It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;
it must "touch and handle" before it will believe.It questions the
existence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;
it questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.It does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the
evaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the
heels of the lightnings.It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find
out) through all its voices, moods and tenses.It invents everything;
from a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through
all the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope
that spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus
in its inventions.It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for
a pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of
oil.From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a
columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it
oscillates like a pendulum.Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in
science.Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life."I
want to know," is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,
the crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it
is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."Our age has inherited the
chief failing of our first mother, and passing by the "Tree of Life in
the midst of the Garden," we are all busily engaged in mercilessly
plundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit.The time is rapidly
approaching when no man will be considered a gentleman who has not filed
his _caveat_ in the Patent Office.The inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins already to be
seen.The philosophy of a cold, blank, calculating materialism has taken
possession of all the avenues of learning.Epicurus is worshiped instead
of Christ.Mammon is considered as the only true savior._Dum Vivimus
Vivamus_, is the maxim we live by, and the creed we die by.Peter has
surrendered his keys to that great incarnate representative of this age,

XXIV._THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._


    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,
      The sword in its scabbard lay still,
    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit
      That crimson-dyed river and rill,
    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,
      To gladden the world with her smile,
    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,
      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,
      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--
    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece
      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;
    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod
      In virginal beauty below;
    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,
      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,
      Remembering the footprints of old
    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,
      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told."I am naked," she cried; "I am homeless on earth;
      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,
    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,
      And condemned to the region of snows."hail"--our fathers exclaim--
      "To the glorious land of the West!With a diadem bright we will honor thy name,
      And enthrone thee America's guest;
    We will found a great nation and call it thine own,
      And erect here an altar to thee,
    Where millions shall kneel at the foot of thy throne
      And swear to forever be free!"Then each brought a vestment her form to enrobe,
      And screen her fair face from the sun,
    And thus she stood forth as the Queen of the globe
      When the work of our Fathers was done.A circlet of stars round her temples they wove,
      That gleamed like Orion's bright band,
    And an emblem of power, the eagle of Jove,
      They perched like a bolt in her hand;
    On her forehead, a scroll that contained but a line
      Was written in letters of light,
    That our great "Constitution" forever might shine,
      A sun to illumine the night.Her feet were incased in broad sandals of gold,
      That riches might spring in her train;
    While a warrior's casque, with its visor uproll'd,
      Protected her tresses and brain;
    Round her waist a bright girdle of satin was bound,
      Formed of colors so blended and true,
    That when as a banner the scarf was unwound,
      It floated the "Red, White and Blue."Then Liberty calm, leant on Washington's arm,
      And spoke in prophetical strain:
    "Columbia's proud hills I will shelter from ills,
      Whilst her valleys and mountains remain;
    But palsied the hand that would pillage the band
      Of sisterhood stars in my crown,
    And death to the knave whose sword would enslave,
      By striking your great charter down."Your eagle shall soar this western world o'er,
      And carry the sound of my name,
    Till monarchs shall quake and its confines forsake,
      If true to your ancestral fame!Your banner shall gleam like the polar star's beam,
      To guide through rebellion's Red sea,
    And in battle 'twill wave, both to conquer and save,
      If borne by the hands of the free!"[Decoration]

XXV._A CAKE OF SOAP._


    I stood at my washstand, one bright sunny morn,
    And gazed through the blinds at the upbringing corn,
    And mourn'd that my summers were passing away,
    Like the dew on the meadow that morning in May.I seized, for an instant, the Iris-hued soap,
    That glowed in the dish, like an emblem of hope,
    And said to myself, as I melted its snows,
    "The longer I use it, the lesser it grows."For life, in its morn, is full freighted and gay,
    And fair as the rainbow when clouds float away;
    Sweet-scented and useful, it sheds its perfume,
    Till wasted or blasted, it melts in the tomb.Thus day after day, whilst we lather and scrub,
    Time wasteth and blasteth with many a rub,
    Till thinner and thinner, the soap wears away,
    And age hands us over to dust and decay.as I dream of thee now,
    With the spice in thy breath, and the bloom on thy brow,
    To a cake of pure Lubin thy life I compare,
    So fragrant, so fragile, and so debonair!But fortune was fickle, and labor was vain,
    And want overtook us, with grief in its train,
    Till, worn out by troubles, death came in the blast;
    But _thy_ kisses, like Lubin's, were sweet to the last!_THE SUMMERFIELD CASE._


The following additional particulars, as sequel to the Summerfield
homicide, have been furnished by an Auburn correspondent:

  MR.EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,
  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to
  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic
  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
  in California.Before proceeding to relate in detail the late
  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of
  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most
  profound and contradictory character.I, for one, halted between
  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent
  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific
  authenticity of the facts related.The doubt with which the story was at first received in this
  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an
  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has
  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that
  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate.Too
  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the
  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the
  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has
  been issued.--P.PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.=$10,000 REWARD!=

                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the
    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the
    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
    familiarly known as Black Bart.Said Graham is accused of the
    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on
    the 14th ultimo.He is five feet ten inches and a half in
    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,
    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in
    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the
    Confederate army.He may be lurking in some of the
    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster
    during the Comstock excitement.The above reward will be paid
    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an
    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield.By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,
                                            Secretary of State.Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.Our correspondent continues:

  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in
  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but
  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of
  the editor above alluded to.But I am detaining you from more
  important matters.Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the
  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on
  the same errand, but without any previous conference.Two of these
  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
  or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."Gillson kept a saloon
  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and
  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the
  Norfolk livery stable.Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his
  untimely end.As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his
  antecedents.It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of
  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an
  habitual gambler.Only one thing about him is certainly well
  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served
  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.He was a man
  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;
  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and
  left him but a wreck of himself.But he was not incapable of
  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of
  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies
  from the flames.In so doing he scorched his left hand so
  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very
  scar may lead to his apprehension.There is no doubt about his
  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will
  probably be not alive.So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses
  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of
  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:


                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My
    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife
    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North
    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's
    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin
    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at
    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from
    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain
    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for
    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one
    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning
    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place
    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered
    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),
    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so
    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan
    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his
    eyes, and begged me, "For God's sake, give me a drop of
    water!"I asked him, "What is the matter?"He replied, "I am
    shot in the back."Without waiting to question him further, I returned
    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and
    sent her off on a run for the men.Taking with me a gourd of
    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman
    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back
    to his side, where I remained until "father"--as we all call
    my husband--came with the men.We removed him as gently as we
    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr.Liebner, and nursed him
    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken
    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A.Q. Did you see him sign it?--A.Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A.(Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name
    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams
    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my
    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last
    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a
    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must
    go for father and the boys immediately.I ran as fast as my
    legs would carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they
    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the
    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday
    sundown, when he died.A. He did
    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more
    audibly and intelligibly.A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the
    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;
    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of
    all sent for the doctor.A. Only myself; he had
    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to
    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and
    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!or he'll set
    the world afire!His tone of voice
    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he
    cried "fire!"his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his
    body convulsed, and before Mrs.Gillson could reach his
    bedside he fell back stone dead.(Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of
  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of
  his demoniac ravings.He would taste nothing from a glass or
  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
  eyes.In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,
  tumblers, and even the castors.At times he spoke rationally, but
  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the
  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his
  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:


    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and
    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the
    most part flighty and in a comatose condition.The wound was
    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball
    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces.It
    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,
    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the
    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the
    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,
    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the
    xiphoid portion of the sternum.Necessarily fatal, there was
    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a
    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect
    of the wound he ultimately died.I witnessed the execution of
    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his
    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his
    perfect senses.It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,
    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read
    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature.I was
    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away
    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his
    bedside shortly afterward.In my judgment, no amount of care
    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a
    few days.(Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.


  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as
  follows:


    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }
                  _vs._               }
            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }_Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken
    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._

    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left
    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the
    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,
    since deceased.It was not fully light when I reached the
    track of the Central Pacific Railroad.Having mined at an
    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky
    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the
    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.One was
    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the
    canyon below.I chose the latter, as being the freest from the
    chance of observation.It required the greatest caution to
    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky
    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the
    railroad.It was now broad daylight, and I commenced
    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.There is quite a
    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the
    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision
    even at a short distance.Brushing aside a thick manzanita
    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that
    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot.It
    was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black Bart."We suddenly
    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying
    exactly between us.Graham
    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we
    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse
    whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that
    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly
    as I bid you, as long as you live!"Fate sat there, cold and
    remorseless as stone.I hesitated; with his left hand he
    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
    handle of a navy revolver.As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his
    brow darkened into a scowl."As your confederate," I answered,
    "never as your slave."The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.The
    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of
    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty.Snow and ice
    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed
    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the
    entrails.But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to
    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of
    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory
    Summerfield.But they did
    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost
    froze my blood.In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,
    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed
    vial which was the object of our mutual visit.Graham fell
    upon his knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the
    grasp of its dead possessor.But the bones were firm, and when
    he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden
    wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems."Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets," he
    commanded.He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand into
    the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS., matted
    closely together and stained by the winter's rains.A further
    search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold coin, a set
    of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk, and a pair of
    silver-mounted spectacles.Hastily covering over the body with
    leaves and branches cut from the embowering shrubs, we
    shudderingly left the spot.We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the American
    River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered thicket,
    where we threw ourselves upon the ground.Neither had spoken a
    word since we left the scene above described.Graham was the
    first to break the silence which to me had become oppressive."Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are safe."I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him."Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure," he added.Saying
    this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief and
    placed it in his bosom.As he said this he laughed derisively, and cut
    a most scornful and threatening glance toward me."Yes," I rejoined firmly; "_our_ prize!""Gillson," retorted Graham, "you must regard me as a
    consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah.This bottle is
    mine, and _mine_ only.It is a great fortune for _one_, but of
    less value than a toadstool for _two_.I am willing to divide
    fairly.This secret would be of no service to a coward.He
    would not dare to use it.Your share of the robbery of the
    body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them to some poor devil
    of a printer, and pay yourself for your day's work."Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS.at my feet; but I
    disdained to touch them.Observing this, he gathered them up
    safely and replaced them in his pocket."As you are unarmed,"
    he said, "it would not be safe for you to be seen in this
    neighborhood during daylight.We will both spend the night
    here, and just before morning return to Auburn.I will
    accompany you part of the distance."With the _sangfroid_ of a perfect desperado, he then stretched
    himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank deeply from a
    whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling his hat over his
    eyes, was soon asleep and snoring.It was a long time before I
    could believe the evidence of my own senses.Finally, I
    approached the ruffian, and placed my hand on his shoulder.He
    did not stir a muscle.I listened; I heard only the deep, slow
    breathing of profound slumber.Resolved not to be balked and
    defrauded by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial
    from his pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear
    the click of a revolver behind me.I remember
    only a dash and an explosion--a deathly sensation, a whirl of
    the rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the
    lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth.When I
    awoke to consciousness it was past midnight.I looked up at
    the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face.That
    constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season of the
    year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me that
    many weary hours would intervene before daylight.My right arm
    was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it rested in a
    pool of my own blood.I
    exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the night
    blast responded.Shortly after daylight I
    revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered on the
    next day by the kind mistress of this cabin.I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my assassination.I do
    this in the perfect possession of my senses, and with a full
    sense of my responsibility to Almighty God.(Signed)                        C. P. GILLSON.GEORGE SIMPSON, Notary Public.KARL LIEBNER,}

  of MSS.which had been thrown in at the transom over the door,
  labeled, "The Summerfield MSS."Attached to them was an unsealed
  note from one Bartholomew Graham, in these words:

    DEAR SIR: These are yours: you have earned them.I commend
    to your especial notice the one styled "_De Mundo Comburendo_."At a future time you may hear again from

                                            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.A casual glance at the papers convinces me that they are of great
  literary value.Summerfield's fame never burned so brightly as it
  does over this grave.[Decoration]

XXVII._THE AVITOR._


    Hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the nerves that never quail;
    For the heart that beats in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      Where the eagle's breath would fail!As the genii bore Aladdin away,
      In search of his palace fair,
    On his magical wings to the land of Cathay,
    So here I will spread out my pinions to-day
      On the cloud-borne billows of air.to its home on the mountain crag,
      Where the condor builds its nest,
    I mount far fleeter than hunted stag,
    I float far higher than Switzer flag--
      Hurrah for the lightning's guest!Away, over steeple and cross and tower--
      Away, over river and sea;
    I spurn at my feet the tempests that lower,
    Like minions base of a vanquished power,
      And mutter their thunders at me!Diablo frowns, as above him I pass,
      Still loftier heights to attain;
    Calaveras' groves are but blades of grass--
    Yosemite's sentinel peaks a mass
      Of ant-hills dotting a plain!Sierra Nevada's shroud of snow,
      And Utah's desert of sand,
    Shall never again turn backward the flow
    Of that human tide which may come and go
      To the vales of the sunset land!Wherever the coy earth veils her face
      With tresses of forest hair;
    Where polar pallors her blushes efface,
    Or tropical blooms lend her beauty and grace--
      I can flutter my plumage there!Where the Amazon rolls through a mystical land--
      Where Chiapas buried her dead--
    Where Central Australian deserts expand--
    Where Africa seethes in saharas of sand--
      Even there shall my pinions spread!No longer shall earth with her secrets beguile,
      For I, with undazzled eyes,
    Will trace to their sources the Niger and Nile,
    And stand without dread on the boreal isle,
      The Colon of the skies!Then hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the sinews that never quail;
    For the heart that throbs in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      When the eagle's breath would fail![Decoration]


XXVIII._LOST AND FOUND._


    'Twas eventide in Eden.The mortals stood,
    Watchful and solemn, in speechless sorrow bound.He was erect, defiant, and unblenched.Tho' fallen, free--deceived, but not undone.She leaned on him, and drooped her pensive brow
    In token of the character she bore--
    _The world's first penitent_.Tears, gushing fast,
    Streamed from her azure eyes; and as they fled
    Beyond the eastern gate, where gleamed the swords
    Of guarding Cherubim, the flowers themselves
    Bent their sad heads, surcharged with dewy tears,
    Wept by the stare o'er man's immortal woe.Far had they wandered, slow had been the pace,
    Grief at his heart and ruin on her face,
    Ere Adam turned to contemplate the spot
    Where Earth began, where Heaven was forgot.He gazed in silence, till the crystal wall
    Of Eden trembled, as though doomed to fall:
    Then bidding Eve direct her tear-dimmed eye
    To where the foliage kissed the western sky,
    They saw, with horror mingled with surprise,
    The wall, the garden, and the foliage rise!Slowly it mounted to the vaulted dome,
    And paused as if to beckon mortals home;
    Then, like a cloud when winds are all at rest,
    It floated gently to the distant west,
    And left behind a crimson path of light,
    By which to track the Garden in its flight!Day after day, the exiles wandered on,
    With eyes still fixed, where Eden's smile last shone;
    Forlorn and friendless through the wilds they trod,
    Remembering Eden, but forgetting God,
    Till far across the sea-washed, arid plain,
    The billows thundered that the search was vain!who can tell how oft at eventide,
    When the gay west was blushing like a bride,
    Fair Eve hath whispered in her children's ear,
    "Beyond yon cloud will Eden reappear!"And thus, as slow millenniums rolled away,
    Each generation, ere it turned to clay,
    Has with prophetic lore, by nature blest,
    In search of Eden wandered to the West.I cast my thoughts far up the stream of time,
    And catch its murmurs in my careless rhyme.I hear a footstep tripping o'er the down:
    Behold!In fancy now her splendors reappear;
    Her fleets and phalanxes, her shield and spear;
    Her battle-fields, blest ever by the free,--
    Proud Marathon, and sad Thermopylae!Her poet, foremost in the ranks of fame,
    Homer!a god--but with a mortal's name;
    Historians, richest in primeval lore;
    Orations, sounding yet from shore to shore!Heroes and statesmen throng the enraptured gaze,
    Till glory totters 'neath her load of praise.Surely a clime so rich in old renown
    Could build an Eden, if not woo one down!Plato comes, with wisdom's scroll unfurl'd,
    The proudest gift of Athens to the world!Wisest of mortals, say, for thou can'st tell,
    Thou, whose sweet lips the Muses loved so well,
    Was Greece the Garden that our fathers trod;
    When men, like angels, walked the earth with God?the great Philosopher replied,
    "Though I love Athens better than a bride,
    Her laws are bloody and her children slaves;
    Her sages slumber in empoisoned graves;
    Her soil is sterile, barren are her seas;
    Eden still blooms in the Hesperides,
    Beyond the pillars of far Hercules!Westward, amid the ocean's blandest smile,
    Atlantis blossoms, a perennial Isle;
    A vast Republic stretching far and wide,
    Greater than Greece and Macedon beside!"Across the mental screen
    A mightier spirit stalks upon the scene;
    His tread shakes empires ancient as the sun;
    His voice resounds, and nations are undone;
    War in his tone and battle in his eye,
    The world in arms, a Roman dare defy!Throned on the summit of the seven hills,
    He bathes his gory heel in Tiber's rills;
    Stretches his arms across a triple zone,
    And dares be master of mankind, alone!All peoples send their tribute to his store;
    Wherever rivers glide or surges roar,
    Or mountains rise or desert plains expand,
    His minions sack and pillage every land.But not alone for rapine and for war
    The Roman eagle spreads his pinions far;
    He bears a sceptre in his talons strong,
    To guard the right, to rectify the wrong,
    And carries high, in his imperial beak,
    A shield armored to protect the weak.Justice and law are dropping from his wing,
    Equal alike for consul, serf or king;
    Daggers for tyrants, for patriot-heroes fame,
    Attend like menials on the Roman name!Was Rome the Eden of our ancient state,
    Just in her laws, in her dominion great,
    Wise in her counsels, matchless in her worth,
    Acknowledged great proconsul of the earth?An eye prophetic that has read the leaves
    The sibyls scattered from their loosened sheaves,
    A bard that sang at Rome in all her pride,
    Shall give response;--let Seneca decide!"Beyond the rocks where Shetland's breakers roar,
    And clothe in foam the wailing, ice-bound shore,
    Within the bosom of a tranquil sea,
    Where Earth has reared her _Ultima Thule_,
    The gorgeous West conceals a golden clime,
    The petted child, the paragon of Time!In distant years, when Ocean's mountain wave
    Shall rock a cradle, not upheave a grave,
    When men shall walk the pathway of the brine,
    With feet as safe as Terra watches mine,
    Then shall the barriers of the Western Sea
    Despised and broken down forever be;
    Then man shall spurn old Ocean's loftiest crest,
    And tear the secret from his stormy breast!"Night settles down
    And shrouds the world in black Plutonian frown;
    Earth staggers on, like mourners to a tomb,
    Wrapt in one long millennium of gloom.That past, the light breaks through the clouds of war,
    And drives the mists of Bigotry afar;
    Amalfi sees her burial tomes unfurl'd,
    And dead Justinian rules again the world.The torch of Science is illumed once more;
    Adventure gazes from the surf-beat shore,
    Lifts in his arms the wave-worn Genoese,
    And hails Iberia, Mistress of the Seas!What cry resounds along the Western main,
    Mounts to the stars, is echoed back again,
    And wakes the voices of the startled sea,
    Dumb until now, from past eternity?is chanted from the Pinta's deck;
    Smiling afar, a minute glory-speck,
    But grandly rising from the convex sea,
    To crown Colon with immortality,
    The Western World emerges from the wave,
    God's last asylum for the free and brave!But where within this ocean-bounded clime,
    This fairest offspring of the womb of time,--
    Plato's Atlantis, risen from the sea,
    Utopia's realm, beyond old Rome's Thule,--
    Where shall we find, within this giant land,
    By blood redeemed, with Freedom's rainbow spann'd,
    The spot first trod by mortals on the earth,
    Where Adam's race was cradled into birth?'Twas sought by Cortez with his warrior band,
    In realms once ruled by Montezuma's hand;
    Where the old Aztec, 'neath his hills of snow,
    Built the bright domes of silver Mexico.Pizarro sought it where the Inca's rod
    Proclaimed the prince half-mortal, demi-god,
    When the mild children of unblest Peru
    Before the bloodhounds of the conqueror flew,
    And saw their country and their race undone,
    And perish 'neath the Temple of the Sun!De Soto sought it, with his tawny bride,
    Near where the Mississippi's waters glide,
    Beneath the ripples of whose yellow wave
    He found at last both monument and grave.Old Ponce de Leon, in the land of flowers,
    Searched long for Eden'midst her groves and bowers,
    Whilst brave La Salle, where Texan prairies smile,
    Roamed westward still, to reach the happy isle.The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower's deck,
    Fleeing beyond a tyrant's haughty beck,
    In quest of Eden, trod the rock-bound shore,
    Where bleak New England's wintry surges roar;
    Raleigh, with glory in his eagle eye,
    Chased the lost realm beneath a Southern sky;
    Whilst Boone believed that Paradise was found
    In old Kentucky's "dark and bloody ground!"In vain their labors, all in vain their toil;
    Doomed ne'er to breathe that air nor tread that soil.Heaven had reserved it till a race sublime
    Should launch its heroes on the wave of time!Go with me now, ye Californian band,
    And gaze with wonder at your glorious land;
    Ascend the summit of yon middle chain,
    When Mount Diablo rises from the plain,
    And cast your eyes with telescopic power,
    O'er hill and forest, over field and flower.how free the hand of God hath roll'd
    A wave of wealth across your Land of Gold!The mountains ooze it from their swelling breast,
    The milk-white quartz displays it in her crest;
    Each tiny brook that warbles to the sea,
    Harps on its strings a golden melody;
    Whilst the young waves are cradled on the shore
    On spangling pillows, stuffed with golden ore!See the Sacramento glide
    Through valleys blooming like a royal bride,
    And bearing onward to the ocean's shore
    A richer freight than Arno ever bore!also fanned by cool refreshing gales,
    Fair Petaluma and her sister vales,
    Whose fields and orchards ornament the plain
    And deluge earth with one vast sea of grain!Santa Clara smiles afar,
    As in the fields of heaven, a radiant star;
    Los Angeles is laughing through her vines;
    Old Monterey sits moody midst her pines;
    Far San Diego flames her golden bow,
    And Santa Barbara sheds her fleece of snow,
    Whilst Bernardino's ever-vernal down
    Gleams like an emerald in a monarch's crown!On the plains of San Joaquin
    Ten thousand herds in dense array are seen.Aloft like columns propping up the skies
    The cloud-kissed groves of Calaveras rise;
    Whilst dashing downward from their dizzy home
    The thundering falls of Yo Semite foam!Opening on an ocean great,
    Behold the portal of the Golden Gate!Pillared on granite, destined e'er to stand
    The iron rampart of the sunset land!With rosy cheeks, fanned by the fresh sea-breeze,
    The petted child of the Pacific seas,
    See San Francisco smile!Majestic heir
    Of all that's brave, or bountiful, or fair,
    Pride of our land, by every wave carest,
    And hailed by nations, Venice of the West!why should I tell,
    What every eye and bosom know so well?Why thy name the land all other lands have blest,
    And traced for ages to the distant West?Why search in vain throughout th' historic page
    For Eden's garden and the Golden Age?NO FURTHER LET US ROAM;
    THIS IS THE GARDEN![Decoration]

Printer Corrections and Notes:

p."THE TELESCOPIC EYE" changed
from p."THE EMERALD EYE from p.and "Secondly", to conform with remaining
recitations on succeeding page 202.

p.227, "The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?"Wherever the printer used a row of asterisks as a separator, the number
of asterisks used has been standardized to 5.Wherever the printer used blank space as a separator, a row of five
number signs (#) appears.Daggett always asks all the communicants to sit in
the body pews and the noncommunicants in the side pews.We always feel
like the goats on the left when we leave Grandfather and Grandmother and
go on the side, but we won't have to always.Abbie Clark, Mary Field and
I think we will join at the communion in September.Grandmother says she
hopes we realize what a solemn thing it is.We are fifteen years old so
I think we ought to.Daggett say in his beautiful
voice, "I now renounce all ways of sin as what I truly abhor and choose
the service of God as my greatest privilege," could think it any
trifling matter.I feel as though I couldn't be bad if I wanted to be,
and when he blesses them and says, "May the God of the Everlasting
Covenant keep you firm and holy to the end through Jesus Christ our
Lord," everything seems complete.He always says at the close, "And when
they had sung an hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives."Then he
gives out the hymn, beginning:

    "According to Thy gracious word,
    In deep humility,
    This will I do, my dying Lord
    I will remember Thee."And the last verse:

    "And when these failing lips grow dumb,
    And mind and memory flee,
    When in Thy kingdom Thou shalt come,
    Jesus remember me."Gideon Granger]

Deacon Taylor always starts the hymn.Deacon Taylor and Deacon Tyler sit
on one side of Dr.Daggett and Deacon Clarke and Deacon Castle on the
other.Grandfather and Grandmother joined the church fifty-one years ago
and are the oldest living members.She says they have always been glad
that they took this step when they were young._August_ 17.--There was a celebration in town to-day because the Queen's
message was received on the Atlantic cable.Guns were fired and church
bells rung and flags were waving everywhere.In the evening there was a
torchlight procession and the town was all lighted up except Gibson
Street.Allie Antes died this morning, so the people on that street kept
their houses as usual.Anna says that probably Allie Antes was better
prepared to die than any other little girl in town.Atwater hall and the
academy and the hotel were more brilliantly illuminated than any other
buildings.Grandfather saw something in a Boston paper that a minister
said in his sermon about the Atlantic cable and he wants me to write it
down in my journal.This is it: "The two hemispheres are now
successfully united by means of the electric wire, but what is it, after
all, compared with the instantaneous communication between the Throne of
Divine Grace and the heart of man?It is
transmitted through realms of unmeasured space more rapidly than the
lightning's flash, and the answer reaches the soul e're the prayer has
died away on the sinner's lips.Yet this telegraph, performing its
saving functions ever since Christ died for men on Calvary, fills not
the world with exultation and shouts of gladness, with illuminations and
bonfires and the booming of cannon.The reason is, one is the telegraph
of this world and may produce revolutions on earth; the other is the
sweet communication between Christ and the Christian soul and will
secure a glorious immortality in Heaven."Grandfather appreciates
anything like that and I like to please him.Grandfather says he thinks the 19th Psalm is a prophecy of the electric
telegraph."Their line is gone out through all the earth and their words
to the end of the world."Henry Ward Beecher is staying at Judge Taylor's and came
with them to church to-day.Everybody knew that he was here and thought
he would preach and the church was packed full.When he came in he went
right to Judge Taylor's pew and sat with him and did not preach at all,
but it was something to look at him.Daggett was away on his
vacation and Rev.Jervis of the M. E. church preached.I heard some
people say they guessed even Mr.Beecher heard some new words to-day,
for Mr.Jervis is quite a hand to make them up or find very long hard
ones in the dictionary._August_ 30, 1858.--Rev.Tousley was hurt to-day by the falling of
his barn which was being moved, and they think his back is broken and if
he lives he can never sit up again.Only last Sunday he was in Sunday
School and had us sing in memory of Allie Antes:

    "A mourning class, a vacant seat,
    Tell us that one we loved to meet
    Will join our youthful throng no more,
    'Till all these changing scenes are o'er."And now he will never meet with us again and the children will never
have another minister all their own.He thinks he may be able to write
letters to the children and perhaps write his own life.We all hope he
may be able to sit up if he cannot walk.We went to our old home in Penn Yan visiting last week and stayed at
Judge Ellsworth's.We called to see the Tunnicliffs and the Olivers,
Wells, Jones, Shepards, Glovers, Bennetts, Judds and several other
families.They were glad to see us for the sake of our father and
mother.Father was their pastor from 1841 to 1847.Some one told us that when Bob and Henry Antes were small boys they
thought they would like to try, just for once, to see how it would seem
to be bad, so in spite of all of Mr.Tousley's sermons they went out
behind the barn one day and in a whisper Bob said, "I swear," and Henry
said, "So do I."Then they came into the house looking guilty and quite
surprised, I suppose, that they were not struck dead just as Ananias and
Sapphira were for lying._September_.--I read in a New York paper to-day that Hon.George
Peabody, of England, presented Cyrus W. Field with a solid silver tea
service of twelve pieces, which cost $4,000.Field, with the coat of arms of the Field family.The epergne is supported by a base representing the genius of America.We had experiments in the philosophy class to-day and took electric
shocks.Chubbuck managed the battery which has two handles attached.Two of the girls each held one of these and we all took hold of hands
making the circuit complete.After a while it jerked us almost to pieces
and we asked Mr.Dana Luther, one of the
Academy boys, walked up from the post-office with me this noon.He lives
in Naples and is Florence Younglove's cousin.We went to a ball game
down on Pleasant Street after school.I got so far ahead of Anna coming
home she called me her "distant relative."1859

_January_, 1859.--Mr.Woodruff came to see Grandfather to ask him if we
could attend his singing school.He is going to have it one evening each
week in the chapel of our church.Quite a lot of the boys and girls are
going, so we were glad when Grandfather gave his consent.Woodruff
wants us all to sing by note and teaches "do re me fa sol la si do" from
the blackboard and beats time with a stick.He lets us have a recess,
which is more fun than all the rest of it.He says if we practise well
we can have a concert in Bemis Hall to end up with._February_.--Anna has been teasing me all the morning about a verse
which John Albert Granger Barker wrote in my album.He has a most
fascinating lisp when he talks, so she says this is the way the verse
reads:

    "Beauty of perthon, ith thertainly chawming
    Beauty of feachure, by no meanth alawming
    But give me in pwefrence, beauty of mind,
    Or give me Cawwie, with all thwee combined."It takes Anna to find "amuthement" in "evewything."Mary Wheeler came over and pierced my ears to-day, so I can wear my new
earrings that Uncle Edward sent me.She pinched my ear until it was numb
and then pulled a needle through, threaded with silk.It is all the
fashion for girls to cut off their hair and friz it.Anna and I have cut
off ours and Bessie Seymour got me to cut off her lovely long hair
to-day.It won't be very comfortable for us to sleep with curl papers
all over our heads, but we must do it now.I wanted my new dress waist
which Miss Rosewarne is making, to hook up in front, but Grandmother
said I would have to wear it that way all the rest of my life so I had
better be content to hook it in the back a little longer.She said when
Aunt Glorianna was married, in 1848, it was the fashion for grown up
women to have their waists fastened in the back, so the bride had hers
made that way but she thought it was a very foolish and inconvenient
fashion.It is nice, though, to dress in style and look like other
people.I have a Garibaldi waist and a Zouave jacket and a balmoral
skirt._Sunday_.--I asked Grandmother if I could write a letter to Father
to-day, and she said I could begin it and tell him that I went to church
and what Mr.Daggett's text was and then finish it to-morrow.I did so,
but I wish I could do it all after I began.She said a verse from the
Tract Primer:

    "A Sabbath well spent brings a week of content
    And strength for the toil of to-morrow,
    But a Sabbath profaned, whatever be gained,
    Is a certain forerunner of sorrow."_Monday_.--We dressed up in new fangled costumes to-day and wore them to
school.Some of us wore dresses almost up to our knees and some wore
them trailing on the ground.Some wore their hair twisted in knots and
some let theirs hang down their backs.I wore my new waterfall for the
first time and Abbie Clark said I looked like "Hagar in the Wilderness."When she came in she looked like a fashion plate, bedecked with bows and
ribbons and her hair up in a new way.When she came in the door she
stopped and said solemnly: "If you have tears prepare to shed them now!"Laura Chapin would not participate in the fun, for once.She said she
thought "Beauty unadorned was the dorndest."We did not have our lesson
in mental philosophy very well so we asked Mr.Richards to explain the
nature of dreams and their cause and effect.He gave us a very
interesting talk, which occupied the whole hour.We listened with
breathless attention, so he must have marked us 100.There was a lecture at the seminary to-night and Rev.Hibbard, the
Methodist minister, who lives next door above the Methodist church, came
home with us.Grandmother was very much pleased when we told her._March_ 1.--Our hired man has started a hot bed and we went down behind
the barn to see it.Grandfather said he was up at 6 o'clock and walked
up as far as Mr.Greig's lions and back again for exercise before
breakfast.He seems to have the bloom of youth on his face as a reward.Anna says she saw "Bloom of youth" advertised in the drug store and she
is going to buy some.I know Grandmother won't let her for it would be
like "taking coal to Newcastle."_April._--Anna wanted me to help her write a composition last night, and
we decided to write on "Old Journals," so we got hers and mine both out
and made selections and then she copied them.When we were on our way to
school this morning we met Mr.E. M. Morse and Anna asked him if he did
not want to read her composition that Carrie wrote for her.He made a
very long face and pretended to be much shocked, but said he would like
to read it, so he took it and also her album, which she asked him to
write in.At night, on his way home, he stopped at our door and left
them both.When she looked in her album, she found this was what he had
written:

"Anna, when you have grown old and wear spectacles and a cap, remember
the boyish young man who saw your fine talents in 1859 and was certain
you would add culture to nature and become the pride of Canandaigua.Do
not forget also that no one deserves praise for anything done by others
and that your progress in wisdom and goodness will be watched by no one
more anxiously than by your true friend,
                                                          E. M.I think she might as well have told Mr.Morse that the old journals were
as much hers as mine; but I think she likes to make out she is not as
good as she is.Sarah Foster helped us to do our arithmetic examples
to-day.Much to our surprise Bridget Flynn, who has lived with us so long, is
married.We didn't know she thought of such a thing, but she has gone.Anna and I have learned how to make rice and cornstarch puddings.We
have a new girl in Bridget's place but I don't think she will do.Grandmother asked her to-day if she seasoned the gravy and she said,
either she did or she didn't, she couldn't tell which.Grandfather says
he thinks she is a little lacking in the "upper story."_June._--A lot of us went down to Sucker Brook this afternoon.Abbie
Clark was one and she told us some games to play sitting down on the
grass.We played "Simon says thumbs up" and then we pulled the leaves
off from daisies and said,

    "Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
    Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,"

to see which we would marry.Anna's came
"rich man" every time and she thinks it is true because Eugene Stone has
asked to marry her and he is quite well off.He
is going now to his home in St.Paul, Minn., but he is coming back for
her some day.Tom Eddy is going to be groomsman and Emma Wheeler
bridesmaid.She has not shown any
of Eugene Stone's notes to Grandmother yet for she does not think it is
worth while.Anna broke the seal on Tom Eddy's page in her mystic book,
although he wrote on it, "Not to be opened until December 8, 1859."He
says:

Dear Anna,--

I hope that in a few years I will see you and Stone living on the banks
of the Mississippi, in a little cottage, as snug as a bug in a rug,
living in peace, so that I can come and see you and have a good
time.--Yours,
                                                        Thos.Anna says if she does marry Eugene Stone and he forgets, after two or
three years to be as polite to her as he is now she shall look up at him
with her sweetest smile and say, "Miss Anna, won't you have a little
more sugar in your tea?"When I went to school this morning Juliet
Ripley asked, "Where do you think Anna Richards is now?We could see her from
the chapel window._June_ 7.--Alice Jewett took Anna all through their new house to-day
which is being built and then they went over to Mr.Noah T. Clarke's
partly finished house and went all through that.A dog came out of Cat
Alley and barked at them and scared Anna awfully.She said she almost
had a conniption fit but Emma kept hold of her.She is so afraid of
thunder and lightning and dogs.Old Friend Burling brought Grandfather a specimen of his handwriting
to-day to keep.This is
the verse he wrote and Grandfather gave it to me to paste in my book of
extracts:

              DIVINE LOVE.Could we with ink the ocean fill,
    Was the whole earth of parchment made,
    Was every single stick a quill,
    And every man a scribe by trade;
    To write the love of God above
    Would drain the ocean dry;
    Nor could that scroll contain the whole
    Though stretched from sky to sky.Transcribed by William S. Burling, Canandaigua, 1859, in the 83rd year
of his age._Sunday, December_ 8, 1859.--Mr.E. M. Morse is our Sunday School
teacher now and the Sunday School room is so crowded that we go up into
the church for our class recitation.Abbie Clark, Fannie Gaylord and
myself are the only scholars, and he calls us the three Christian
Graces, faith, hope and charity, and the greatest of these is charity.I
am the tallest, so he says I am charity.Gibson's pew,
because it is farthest away and we do not disturb the other classes.He
gave us some excellent advice to-day as to what was right and said if we
ever had any doubts about anything we should never do it and should
always be perfectly sure we are in the right before we act.He gave us
two weeks ago a poem to learn by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.It is an
apostrophe to God and very hard to learn.It is blank verse and has 85
lines in it.I have it committed at last and we are to recite it in
concert.The last two lines are, "Tell thou the silent sky and tell the
stars and tell yon rising sun, Earth with its thousand voices praises
God."Morse delivered a lecture in Bemis Hall last Thursday night.It was splendid and he lent me the
manuscript afterwards to read.Dick Valentine lectured in the hall the
other night too.There was some difference
in the lectures and the lecturers._Friday._--The older ladies of the town have formed a society for the
relief of the poor and are going to have a course of lectures in Bemis
Hall under their auspices to raise funds.The lecturers are to be from
the village and are to be: Rev.O. E. Daggett, subject, "Ladies and
Gentlemen"; Dr.Harvey Jewett, "The House We Live In"; Prof.F. E. R.
Chubbuck, "Progress"; Hon.H. W. Taylor, "The Empty Place"; Prof.E. G.
Tyler, "Finance"; Mr.N. T. Clark, "Chemistry"; E. M. Morse, "Graybeard
and His Dogmas."The young ladies have started a society, too, and we
have great fun and fine suppers.We met at Jennie Howell's to organize.We are to meet once in two weeks and are to present each member with an
album bed quilt with all our names on when they are married.Susie
Daggett says she is never going to be married, but we must make her a
quilt just the same.Laura Chapin sang, "Mary Lindsey, Dear," and we got
to laughing so that Susie Daggett and I lost our equilibrium entirely,
but I found mine by the time I got home.Yesterday afternoon Grandfather
asked us if we did not want to go to ride with him in the big two seated
covered carriage which he does not get out very often.We said yes, and
he stopped for Miss Hannah Upham and took her with us.She sat on the
back seat with me and we rode clear to Farmington and kept up a brisk
conversation all the way.She told us how she became lady principal of
the Ontario Female Seminary in 1830.She was still telling us about it
when we got back home._December_ 23.--We have had a Christmas tree and many other attractions
in Seminary chapel.The day scholars and townspeople were permitted to
participate and we had a post office and received letters from our
friends.E. M. Morse wrote me a fictitious one, claiming to be
written from the north pole ten years hence.I will copy it in my
journal for I may lose the letter.I had some gifts on the Christmas
tree and gave some.Chubbuck, with two large
hemstitched handkerchiefs with his initials embroidered in a corner of
each.As he is favored with the euphonious name of Frank Emery Robinson
Chubbuck it was a work of art to make his initials look beautiful.I
inclosed a stanza in rhyme:

    Amid the changing scenes of life
    If any storm should rise,
    May you ever have a handkerchief
    To wipe your weeping eyes.Morse's letter:

                                        North Pole, 10 _January_ 1869.Miss Carrie Richards,

"My Dear Young Friend.--It is very cold here and the pole is covered
with ice.I climbed it yesterday to take an observation and arrange our
flag, the Stars and Stripes, which I hoisted immediately on my arrival
here, ten years ago.I thought I should freeze and the pole was so
slippery that I was in great danger of coming down faster than was
comfortable.Although this pole has been used for more than 6,000 years
it is still as good as new.The works of the Great Architect do not wear
out.It is now ten years since I have seen you and my other two
Christian Graces and I have no doubt of your present position among the
most brilliant, noble and excellent women in all America.I always knew
and recognized your great abilities.Nature was very generous to you all
and you were enjoying fine advantages at the time I last knew you.I
thought your residence with your Grandparents an admirable school for
you, and you and your sister were most evidently the best joy of their
old age.At the time that I left my
three Christian Graces, Mrs.Grundy was sometimes malicious enough to
say that they were injuring themselves by flirting.I always told the
old lady that I had the utmost confidence in the judgment and discretion
of my pupils and that they would be very careful and prudent in all
their conduct.I confessed that flirting was wrong and very injurious to
any one who was guilty of it, but I was very sure that you were not.I
could not believe that you would disappoint us all and become only
ordinary women, but that you would become the most exalted characters,
scorning all things unworthy of ladies and Christians and I was right
and Mrs.When the ice around the pole thaws out I
shall make a flying visit to Canandaigua.I send you a tame polar bear
for a playfellow.This letter will be conveyed to you by Esquimaux
express.--Most truly yours,
                                                        E. M.I think some one must have shown some verses that we girls wrote, to
Mrs.Grundy and made her think that our minds were more upon the young
men than they were upon our studies, but if people knew how much time we
spent on Paley's "Evidences of Christianity" and Butler's Analogy and
Kames' Elements of Criticism and Tytler's Ancient History and Olmstead's
Mathematical Astronomy and our French and Latin and arithmetic and
algebra and geometry and trigonometry and bookkeeping, they would know
we had very little time to think of the masculine gender.1860

_New Year's Day._--We felt quite grown up to-day and not a little scared
when we saw Mr.Chubbuck all
coming in together to make a New Year's call.We did not feel so flustrated when Will Schley and Horace Finley
came in later.Oliver Phelps, Jr., came to call upon Grandmother._January_ 5.--Abbie Clark and I went up to see Miss Emma Morse because
it is her birthday.We call her sweet Miss Emma and we think Mr.We went to William Wirt Howe's lecture in Bemis Hall
this evening.Anna wanted to walk down a little ways with the girls after school so
she crouched down between Helen Coy and Hattie Paddock and walked past
the house.Grandmother always sits in the front window, so when Anna
came in she asked her if she had to stay after school and Anna gave her
an evasive answer.It reminds me of a story I read, of a lady who told
the servant girl if any one called to give an evasive answer as she did
not wish to receive calls that day.By and by the door bell rang and the
servant went to the door.When she came back the lady asked her how she
dismissed the visitor.She said, "Shure ye towld me to give an evasive
answer, so when the man asked if the lady of the house was at home I
said, 'Faith!We never say anything like
that to our "dear little lady," but we just change the subject and
divert the conversation into a more agreeable channel.To-day some one
came to see Grandmother when we were gone and told her that Anna and
some others ran away from school.Grandmother told Anna she hoped she
would never let any one bring her such a report again.Anna said she
would not, if she could possibly help it!Some one
who believes in the text, "Look not every man on his own things, but
every man also on the things of others."Grandfather told us to-night
that we ought to be very careful what we do as we are making history
every day.Anna says she shall try not to have hers as dry as some that
she had to learn at school to-day._February_ 9.--Dear Miss Mary Howell was married to-day to Mr._February_ 28.--Grandfather asked me to read Abraham Lincoln's speech
aloud which he delivered in Cooper Institute, New York, last evening,
under the auspices of the Republican Club.He was escorted to the
platform by David Dudley Field and introduced by William Cullen Bryant.The _New York Times_ called him "a noted political exhorter and Prairie
orator."It was a thrilling talk and must have stirred men's souls._April_ 1.--Aunt Ann was over to see us yesterday and she said she made
a visit the day before out at Mrs.Phelps and
Miss Eliza Chapin also went and they enjoyed talking over old times when
they were young.Maggie Gorham is going to be married on the 25th to Mr.She always said she would not marry a farmer and
would not live in a cobblestone house and now she is going to do both,
for Mr.Benedict has bought the farm near theirs and it has a
cobblestone house.We have always thought her one of the jolliest and
prettiest of the older set of young ladies._June._--James writes that he has seen the Prince of Wales in New York.He was up on the roof of the Continental Fire Insurance building, out on
the cornice, and looked down on the procession.Afterwards there was a
reception for the Prince at the University Law School and James saw him
close by.He says he has a very pleasant youthful face.There was a ball
given for him one evening in the Academy of Music and there were 3,000
present.The ladies who danced with him will never forget it.They say
that he enters into every diversion which is offered to him with the
greatest tact and good nature, and when he visited Mount Vernon he
showed great reverence for the memory of George Washington.He attended
a literary entertainment in Boston, where Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson,
Thoreau, and other Americans of distinction were presented to him.He
will always be a favorite in America.Annie Granger asked Anna and me to come over to her house
and see her baby.We were very eager to go and wanted to hold it and
carry it around the room.She was willing but asked us if we had any
pins on us anywhere.She said she had the nurse sew the baby's clothes
on every morning so that if she cried she would know whether it was
pains or pins.We said we had no pins on us, so we stayed quite a while
and held little Miss Hattie to our heart's content.She is named for her
aunt, Hattie Granger.Anna says she thinks Miss Martha Morse will give
medals to her and Mary Daggett for being the most meddlesome girls in
school, judging from the number of times she has spoken to them to-day.Anna is getting to be a regular punster, although I told her that
Blair's Rhetoric says that punning is not the highest kind of wit.Morse met us coming from school in the rain and said it would not hurt
us as we were neither sugar nor salt.Anna said, "No, but we are
'lasses."Grandmother has been giving us sulphur and molasses for the
purification of the blood and we have to take it three mornings and then
skip three mornings.This morning Anna commenced going through some sort
of gymnastics and Grandmother asked her what she was doing, and she said
it was her first morning to skip.Abbie Clark had a large tea-party this afternoon and evening--Seminary
girls and a few Academy boys.We had a fine supper and then played
games.Abbie gave us one which is a test of memory and we tried to learn
it from her but she was the only one who could complete it.I can write
it down, but not say it:

A good fat hen.Three plump partridges, two ducks and a good fat hen.Four squawking wild geese, three plump partridges, etc.Six pairs of Don Alfonso's tweezers.Seven hundred rank and file Macedonian horsemen drawn up in line of
battle.Eight cages of heliogabalus sparrow kites.Nine sympathetical, epithetical, categorical propositions.Eleven flat bottom fly boats sailing between Madagascar and Mount
Palermo.Twelve European dancing masters, sent to teach the Egyptian mummies how
to dance, against Hercules' wedding day.Abbie says it was easier to learn than the multiplication table.They
wanted some of us to recite and Abbie Clark gave us Lowell's poem, "John
P. Robinson, he, says the world'll go right if he only says Gee!"I gave
another of Lowell's poems, "The Courtin'."Julia Phelps had her guitar
with her by request and played and sang for us very sweetly.Fred
Harrington went home with her and Theodore Barnum with me._Sunday._--Frankie Richardson asked me to go with her to teach a class
in the  Sunday School on Chapel Street this afternoon.I asked
Grandmother if I could go and she said she never noticed that I was
particularly interested in the <DW52> race and she said she thought I
only wanted an excuse to get out for a walk Sunday afternoon.However,
she said I could go just this once.When we got up as far as the
Academy, Mr.Noah T. Clarke's brother, who is one of the teachers, came
out and Frank said he led the singing at the Sunday School and she said
she would give me an introduction to him, so he walked up with us and
home again.Grandmother said that when she saw him opening the gate for
me, she understood my zeal in missionary work."The dear little lady,"
as we often call her, has always been noted for her keen discernment and
wonderful sagacity and loses none of it as she advances in years.Some
one asked Anna the other day if her Grandmother retained all her
faculties and Anna said, "Yes, indeed, to an alarming degree."Grandmother knows that we think she is a perfect angel even if she does
seem rather strict sometimes.Whether we are 7 or 17 we are children to
her just the same, and the Bible says, "Children obey your parents in
the Lord for this is right."We are glad that we never will seem old to
her.I had the same company home from church in the evening._Monday._--This morning the cook went to early mass and Anna told
Grandmother she would bake the pancakes for breakfast if she would let
her put on gloves.She would not let her, so Hannah baked the cakes.I
was invited to Mary Paul's to supper to-night and drank the first cup of
tea I ever drank in my life.I had a very nice time and Johnnie Paul
came home with me.Imogen Power and I went down together Friday afternoon to buy me a
Meteorology.We are studying that and Watts on the Mind, instead of
Philosophy._Tuesday._--I went with Fanny Gaylord to see Mrs.Callister at the hotel
to-night.She is so interested in all that we tell her, just like "one
of the girls."[Illustration: The Old Canandaigua Academy]

I was laughing to-day when I came in from the street and Grandmother
asked me what amused me so.Putnam on
the street and she looked so immense and he so minute I couldn't help
laughing at the contrast.Grandmother said that size was not everything,
and then she quoted Cowper's verse:

    "Were I so tall to reach the skies or grasp the ocean in a span,
    I must be measured by my soul, the mind is the stature of the man."_Friday._--We went to Monthly Concert of prayer for Foreign Missions
this evening.I told Grandmother that I thought it was not very
interesting.Judge Taylor read the _Missionary Herald_ about the
Madagascans and the Senegambians and the Terra del Fuegans and then
Deacon Tyler prayed and they sang "From Greenland's Icy Mountains" and
took up a collection and went home.She said she was afraid I did not
listen attentively.I don't think I did strain every nerve.I believe
Grandmother will give her last cent to Missions if the Boards get into
worse straits than they are now.In Latin class to-day Anna translated the phrase Deo Volente "with
violence," and Mr.Tyler, who always enjoys a joke, laughed so, we
thought he would fall out of his chair.He evidently thought it was the
best one he had heard lately._November_ 21.--Aunt Ann gave me a sewing bird to screw on to the table
to hold my work instead of pinning it to my knee.Grandmother tells us
when we sew or read not to get everything around us that we will want
for the next two hours because it is not healthy to sit in one position
so long.She wants us to get up and "stir around."Anna does not need
this advice as much as I do for she is always on what Miss Achert calls
the "qui vive."I am trying to make a sofa pillow out of little pieces
of silk.You have to cut pieces of paper into
octagonal shape and cover them with silk and then sew them together,
over and over.They are beautiful, with bright colors, when they are
done.There was a hop at the hotel last night and some of the girls went
and had an elegant time.Hiram Metcalf came here this morning to
have Grandmother sign some papers.He always looks very dignified, and
Anna and I call him "the deed man."We tried to hear what he said to
Grandmother after she signed her name but we only heard something about
"fear or compulsion" and Grandmother said "yes."Grandfather took us down street to-day to see the new Star
Building.It was the town house and he bought it and got Mr.Warren
Stoddard of Hopewell to superintend cutting it in two and moving the
parts separately to Coach Street.When it was completed the shout went
up from the crowd, "Hurrah for Thomas Beals, the preserver of the old
Court House."No one but Grandfather thought it could be done._December._--I went with the girls to the lake to skate this afternoon.Johnson, the <DW52> barber, is the best skater in town.He can
skate forwards and backwards and cut all sorts of curlicues, although he
is such a heavy man.He is going to Liberia and there his skates won't
do him any good.I wish he would give them to me and also his skill to
use them.Some one asked me to sit down after I got home and I said I
preferred to stand, as I had been sitting down all the afternoon!Gus
Coleman took a load of us sleigh-riding this evening.Of course he had
Clara Willson sit on the front seat with him and help him drive._Thursday._--We had a special meeting of our society this evening at
Mary Wheeler's and invited the gentlemen and had charades and general
good time.Gillette and Horace Finley made a great deal of fun for
us.Gillette into the Dorcas Society, which consists in
seating the candidate in a chair and propounding some very solemn
questions and then in token of desire to join the society, you ask him
to open his mouth very wide for a piece of cake which you swallow,
yourself, instead!We went to a concert at the Seminary this evening.Miss Mollie Bull sang
"Coming Through the Rye" and Miss Lizzie Bull sang "Annie Laurie" and
"Auld Lang Syne."Jennie Lind, herself, could not have done better._December_ 15.--Alice Jewett, Emma Wheeler and Anna are in Mrs.Worthington's Sunday School class and as they have recently united with
the church, she thought they should begin practical Christian work by
distributing tracts among the neglected classes.So this afternoon they
ran away from school to begin the good work.It was so bright and
pleasant, they thought a walk to the lake would be enjoyable and they
could find a welcome in some humble home.The girls wanted Anna to be
the leader, but she would only promise that if something pious came into
her mind, she would say it.They knocked at a door and were met by a
smiling mother of twelve children and asked to come in.They sat down
feeling somewhat embarrassed, but spying a photograph album on the
table, they became much interested, while the children explained the
pictures.Finally Anna felt that it was time to do something, so when no
one was looking, she slipped under one of the books on the table, three
tracts entitled "Consolation for the Bereaved," "Systematic Benevolence"
and "The Social Evils of dancing, card playing and theater-going."Then
they said goodbye to their new friends and started on.They decided not
to do any more pastoral work until another day, but enjoyed the outing
very much._Christmas._--We all went to Aunt Mary Carr's to dinner excepting
Grandmother, and in the evening we went to see some tableaux at Dr.We were very much pleased with
the entertainment.del Pratt, one of the patients,
said every time, "What next!"Grandfather was requested to add his picture to the gallery of portraits
of eminent men for the Court Room, so he has had it painted.An artist
by the name of Green, who lives in town, has finished it after numerous
sittings and brought it up for our approval.We like it but we do not
think it is as good looking as he is.No one could really satisfy us
probably, so we may as well try to be suited.Clarke could take Sunday night supper with us
and she said she was afraid he did not know the catechism.I asked him
Friday night and he said he would learn it on Saturday so that he could
answer every third question any way.1861

_March_ 4, 1861.--President Lincoln was inaugurated to-day._March_ 5.--I read the inaugural address aloud to Grandfather this
evening.He dwelt with such pathos upon the duty that all, both North
and South, owe to the Union, it does not seem as though there could be
war!_April._--We seem to have come to a sad, sad time.The Bible says, "A
man's worst foes are those of his own household."The whole United
States has been like one great household for many years."United we
stand, divided we fall!"has been our watchword, but some who should
have been its best friends have proven false and broken the bond.Men
are taking sides, some for the North, some for the South.Hot words and
fierce looks have followed, and there has been a storm in the air for a
long time._April_ 15.--The storm has broken upon us.The Confederates fired on
Fort Sumter, just off the coast of South Carolina, and forced her on
April 14 to haul down the flag and surrender.President Lincoln has
issued a call for 75,000 men and many are volunteering to go all around
us._May,_ 1861.--Many of the young men are going from Canandaigua and all
the neighboring towns.It seems very patriotic and grand when they are
singing, "It is sweet, Oh, 'tis sweet, for one's country to die," and we
hear the martial music and see the flags flying and see the recruiting
tents on the square and meet men in uniform at every turn and see train
loads of the boys in blue going to the front, but it will not seem so
grand if we hear they are dead on the battlefield, far from home.A lot
of us girls went down to the train and took flowers to the soldiers as
they were passing through and they cut buttons from their coats and gave
to us as souvenirs.We have flags on our paper and envelopes, and have
all our stationery bordered with red, white and blue.We wear little
flag pins for badges and tie our hair with red, white and blue ribbon
and have pins and earrings made of the buttons the soldiers gave us.We
are going to sew for them in our society and get the garments all cut
from the older ladies' society.They work every day in one of the rooms
of the court house and cut out garments and make them and scrape lint
and roll up bandages.They say they will provide us with all the
garments we will make.We are going to write notes and enclose them in
the garments to cheer up the soldier boys.It does not seem now as
though I could give up any one who belonged to me.The girls in our
society say that if any of the members do send a soldier to the war they
shall have a flag bed quilt, made by the society, and have the girls'
names on the stars._May_ 20.--I recited "Scott and the Veteran" to-day at school, and Mary
Field recited, "To Drum Beat and Heart Beat a Soldier Marches By"; Anna
recited "The Virginia Mother."There was a patriotic rally in Bemis Hall last night and a quartette
sang, "The Sword of Bunker Hill" and "Dixie" and "John Brown's Body Lies
a Mouldering in the Grave," and many other patriotic songs.We have one
West Point cadet, Albert M. Murray, who is in the thick of the fight,
and Charles S. Coy represents Canandaigua in the navy.[Illustration: The Ontario Female Seminary]

_June,_ 1861.--At the anniversary exercises, Rev.Samuel M. Hopkins of
Auburn gave the address.I have graduated from Ontario Female Seminary
after a five years course and had the honor of receiving a diploma from
the courtly hands of General John A. Granger.I am going to have it
framed and handed down to my grandchildren as a memento, not exactly of
sleepless nights and midnight vigils, but of rising betimes, at what
Anna calls the crack of dawn.She likes that expression better than
daybreak.I heard her reciting in the back chamber one morning about 4
o'clock and listened at the door.She was saying in the most nonchalant
manner: "Science and literature in England were fast losing all traces
of originality, invention was discouraged, research unvalued and the
examination of nature proscribed.It seemed to be generally supposed
that the treasure accumulated in the preceding ages was quite sufficient
for all national purposes and that the only duty which authors had to
perform was to reproduce what had thus been accumulated, adorned with
all the graces of polished style.Tameness and monotony naturally result
from a slavish adherence to all arbitrary rules and every branch of
literature felt this blighting influence.History, perhaps, was in some
degree an exception, for Hume, Robertson and more especially Gibbon,
exhibited a spirit of original investigation which found no parallel
among their contemporaries."I looked in and asked her where her book
was, and she said she left it down stairs.She has "got it" all right, I
am sure.We helped decorate the seminary chapel for two days.Our motto
was, "Still achieving, still pursuing."Miss Guernsey made most of the
letters and Mr.Chubbuck put them up and he hung all the paintings.General Granger had to use his palm leaf fan all
the time, as well as the rest of us.There were six in our class, Mary
Field, Lucy Petherick, Kate Lilly, Sarah Clay, Abby Scott and myself.Abbie Clark would have been in the class, but she went to Pittsfield,
Mass., instead.General Granger said to each one of us, "It gives me
great pleasure to present you with this diploma," and when he gave Miss
Scott hers, as she is from Alabama, he said he wished it might be as a
flag of truce between the North and the South, and this sentiment was
loudly cheered.General Granger looked so handsome with his black dress
suit and ruffled shirt front and all the natural grace which belongs to
him.The sheepskin has a picture of the Seminary on it and this
inscription: "The Trustees and Faculty of the Ontario Female Seminary
hereby certify that __________ has completed the course of study
prescribed in this Institution, maintained the requisite scholarship and
commendable deportment and is therefore admitted to the graduating
honors of this Institution.President of Board, John A. Granger;
Benjamin F. Richards, Edward G. Tyler, Principals."Morse wrote
something for the paper:

"To the Editor of the Repository:

"Dear Sir--June roses, etc., make our loveliest of villages a paradise
this week.The constellations are all glorious and the stars of earth
far outshine those of the heavens.The lake shore, 'Lovers' Lane,' 'Glen
Kitty' and the 'Points' are full of romance and romancers.The yellow
moon and the blue waters and the dark green shores and the petrified
Indians, whispering stony words at the foot of Genundewah, and Squaw
Island sitting on the waves, like an enchanted grove, and 'Whalesback'
all humped up in the East and 'Devil's Lookout' rising over all, made
the 'Sleeping Beauty' a silver sea of witchery and love; and in the
cottages and palaces we ate the ambrosia and drank the nectar of the
sweet goddesses of this new and golden age."I may as well say to you, Mr.Editor, that the Ontario Female Seminary
closed yesterday and 'Yours truly' was present at the commencement.Being a bachelor I shall plead guilty and appeal to the mercy of the
Court, if indicted for undue prejudice in favor of the charming young
orators.After the report of the Examining Committee, in which the
scholarship of the young ladies was not too highly praised, came the
Latin Salutatory by Miss Clay, a most beautiful and elegant production
(that sentence, sir, applies to both salutatory and salutatorian).The
'Shadows We Cast,' by Miss Field, carried us far into the beautiful
fields of nature and art and we saw the dark, or the brilliant shades,
which our lives will cast, upon society and history.Then 'Tongues in
Trees' began to whisper most bewitchingly, and 'Books in the Running
Brooks' were opened, and 'Sermons in Stones' were preached by Miss
Richards, and this old bachelor thought if all trees would talk so well,
and every brook would babble so musically, and each precious stone would
exhort so brilliantly, as they were made to do by the 'enchantress,'
angels and dreams would henceforth be of little consequence; and whether
the orator should be called 'Tree of Beauty,' 'Minnehaha' or the
'Kohinoor' is a'vexata questio.'Hardick, 'our own,' whose hand never touches the
piano without making delicious music, and Misses Daggett and Wilson,
also 'our own,' and the musical pupils of the Institution, gave a
concert.'The Young Volunteer' was imperatively demanded, and this for
the third time during the anniversary exercises, and was sung amid
thunders of applause, 'Star of the South,' Miss Stella Scott, shining
meanwhile in all her radiant beauty.May her glorious light soon rest on
a Union that shall never more be broken.--Soberly yours,

                                                A Very Old Bachelor."_June,_ 1861.--There was a patriotic rally this afternoon on the campus
of Canandaigua Academy and we Seminary girls went.They raised a flag on
the Academy building.Coleman led the
choir and they sang "The Star Spangled Banner."Noah T. Clarke made
a stirring speech and Mr.Gideon Granger, James C. Smith and E. M. Morse
followed.Canandaigua has already raised over $7,000 for the war.Barry drills the Academy boys in military tactics on the campus every
day.Lester P. Thompson, son of "Father
Thompson," among the others.A young man asked Anna to take a drive to-day, but Grandmother was not
willing at first to let her go.She finally gave her consent, after
Anna's plea that he was so young and his horse was so gentle.Just as
they were ready to start, I heard Anna run upstairs and I heard him say,
"What an Anna!"I asked her afterwards what she went for and she said
she remembered that she had left the soap in the water.Daggett's war sermon from the 146th Psalm was wonderful.He had a stroke of paralysis two weeks
ago and for several days he has been unconscious.The choir of our
church, of which he was leader for so long, and some of the young people
came and stood around his bed and sang, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul."They
did not know whether he was conscious or not, but they thought so
because the tears ran down his cheeks from his closed eyelids, though he
could not speak or move.Daggett's text was, "The Beloved Physician."1862

_January_ 26.--We went to the Baptist Church this evening to hear Rev.A. H. Lung preach his last sermon before going into the army._February_ 17.--Glorious news from the war to-day.Fort Donelson is
taken with 1,500 rebels._February_ 21.--Our society met at Fanny Palmer's this afternoon.I went
but did not stay to tea as we were going to Madame Anna Bishop's concert
in the evening.Her voice has great
scope and she was dressed in the latest stage costume, but it took so
much material for her skirt that there was hardly any left for the
waist.[Illustration: "Old Friend Burling", Madame Anna Bishop]

_Washington's Birthday._--Patriotic services were held in the
Congregational Church this morning.Madame Anna Bishop sang, and
National songs were sung.James C. Smith read Washington's Farewell
Address.In the afternoon a party of twenty-two, young and old, took a
ride in the Seminary boat and went to Mr.Paton's on the lake shore
road.We carried flags and made it a patriotic occasion.I sat next to
Spencer F. Lincoln, a young man from Naples who is studying law in Mr.I never met him before but he told me he had
made up his mind to go to the war.It is wonderful that young men who
have brilliant prospects before them at home, will offer themselves upon
the altar of their country.There
is a picture of the flag on the envelope and underneath, "If any one
attempts to haul down the American flag shoot him on the spot.--
John A._Sunday, February_ 23.--Everybody came out to church this morning,
expecting to hear Madame Anna Bishop sing.She was not there, and an
"agent" made a "statement."The audience did not appear particularly
edified._March_ 4.--John B. Gough lectured in Bemis Hall last night and was
entertained by Governor Clark.I told Grandfather that I had an
invitation to the lecture and he asked me who from.He did not make the least objection and I was
awfully glad, because he has asked me to the whole course.Wendell
Phillips and Horace Greeley, E. H. Chapin and John G. Saxe and Bayard
Taylor are expected.John B. Gough's lecture was fine.He can make an
audience laugh as much by wagging his coat tails as some men can by
talking an hour._March_ 26.--I have been up at Laura Chapin's from 10 o'clock in the
morning until 10 at night, finishing Jennie Howell's bed quilt, as she
is to be married very soon.We
finished it at 8 p. m. and when we took it off the frames we gave three
cheers.Some of the youth of the village came up to inspect our
handiwork and see us home.Before we went Julia Phelps sang and played
on the guitar and Captain Barry also sang and we all sang together, "O!Columbia, the gem of the ocean, three cheers for the red, white and
blue."_June_ 19.--Our cousin, Ann Eliza Field, was married to-day to George B.
Bates at her home on Gibson Street.Charlie Wheeler made great fun and threw the final shower of rice as
they drove away._June._--There was great excitement in prayer meeting last night, it
seemed to Abbie Clark, Mary Field and me on the back seat where we
always sit.Several people have asked us why we sit away back there by
old Mrs.Kinney, but we tell them that she sits on the other side of the
stove from us and we like the seat, because we have occupied it so long.I presume we would see less and hear more if we sat in front.Walter Hubbell had made one of his most beautiful prayers
and Mr.Cyrus Dixon was praying, a big June bug came zipping into the
room and snapped against the wall and the lights and barely escaped
several bald heads.Anna kept dodging around in a most startling manner
and I expected every moment to see her walk out and take Emma Wheeler
with her, for if she is afraid of anything more than dogs it is June
bugs.At this crisis the bug flew out and a cat stealthily walked in.Taylor was always unpleasantly affected by the sight
of cats and we didn't know what would happen if the cat should go near
her.The cat very innocently ascended the steps to the desk and as Judge
and Mrs.Taylor always sit on the front seat, she couldn't help
observing the ambitious animal as it started to assist Dr.Daggett in
conducting the meeting.Taylor just managed to
reach the outside door before fainting away.We were glad when the
benediction was pronounced._June._--Anna and I had a serenade last night from the Academy Glee
Club, I think, as their voices sounded familiar.We were awakened by the
music, about 11 p. m., quite suddenly and I thought I would step across
the hall to the front chamber for a match to light the candle.I was
only half awake, however, and lost my bearings and stepped off the
stairs and rolled or slid to the bottom.The stairs are winding, so I
must have performed two or three revolutions before I reached my
destination.I jumped up and ran back and found Anna sitting up in bed,
laughing.She asked me where I had been and said if I had only told her
where I was going she would have gone for me.We decided not to strike a
light, but just listen to the singing.Anna said she was glad that the
leading tenor did not know how quickly I "tumbled" to the words of his
song, "O come my love and be my own, nor longer let me dwell alone," for
she thought he would be too much flattered.Grandfather came into the
hall and asked if any bones were broken and if he should send for a
doctor.We told him we guessed not, we thought we would be all right in
the morning.He thought it was Anna who fell down stairs, as he is never
looking for such exploits in me.We girls received some verses from the
Academy boys, written by Greig Mulligan, under the assumed name of Simon
Snooks.The subject was, "The Poor Unfortunate Academy Boys."We have
answered them and now I fear Mrs.Grundy will see them and imagine
something serious is going on.But she is mistaken and will find, at the
end of the session, our hearts are still in our own possession.When we were down at Sucker Brook the other afternoon we were watching
the water and one of the girls said, "How nice it would be if our lives
could run along as smoothly as this stream."I said I thought it would
be too monotonous.Laura Chapin said she supposed I would rather have an
"eddy" in mine.We went to the examination at the Academy to-day and to the gymnasium
exercises afterwards.Noah T. Clarke's brother leads them and they
do some great feats with their rings and swings and weights and ladders.We girls can do a few in the bowling alley at the Seminary._June._--I visited Eureka Lawrence in Syracuse and we attended
commencement at Hamilton College, Clinton, and saw there, James
Tunnicliff and Stewart Ellsworth of Penn Yan.I also saw Darius Sackett
there among the students and also became acquainted with a very
interesting young man from Syracuse, with the classic name of Horace
Publius Virgilius Bogue.Both of these young men are studying for the
ministry.I also saw Henry P. Cook, who used to be one of the Academy
boys, and Morris Brown, of Penn Yan.They talk of leaving college and
going to the war and so does Darius Sackett._July,_ 1862.--The President has called for 300,000 more brave men to
fill up the ranks of the fallen.We hear every day of more friends and
acquaintances who have volunteered to go._August_ 20.--The 126th Regiment, just organized, was mustered into
service at Camp Swift, Geneva.Those that I know who belong to it are
Colonel E. S. Sherrill, Lieutenant Colonel James M. Bull, Captain
Charles A. Richardson, Captain Charles M. Wheeler, Captain Ten Eyck
Munson, Captain Orin G. Herendeen, Surgeon Dr.Charles S. Hoyt, Hospital
Steward Henry T. Antes, First Lieutenant Charles Gage, Second Lieutenant
Spencer F. Lincoln, First Sergeant Morris Brown, Corporal Hollister N.
Grimes, Privates Darius Sackett, Henry Willson, Oliver Castle, William
Lamport.Hoyt wrote home: "God bless the dear ones we leave behind; and while
you try to perform the duties you owe to each other, we will try to
perform ours."We saw by the papers that the volunteers of the regiment before leaving
camp at Geneva allotted over $15,000 of their monthly pay to their
families and friends at home.One soldier sent this telegram to his
wife, as the regiment started for the front: "God bless you._August._--The New York State S. S. convention is convened here and the
meetings are most interesting.They were held in our church and lasted
three days.Hart, from New York, led the singing and Mr.Noah T. Clarke was in his element all through
the meetings.Pardee gave some fine blackboard exercises.Tousley was wheeled into the church, in his invalid
chair, and said a few words, which thrilled every one.So much
tenderness, mingled with his old time enthusiasm and love for the cause.It is the last time probably that his voice will ever be heard in
public.They closed the grand meeting with the hymn beginning:

    "Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love."In returning thanks to the people of Canandaigua for their generous
entertainment, Mr.Ralph Wells facetiously said that the cost of the
convention must mean something to Canandaigua people, for the cook in
one home was heard to say, "These religiouses do eat awful!"_September_ 13.--Darius Sackett was wounded by a musket shot in the leg,
at Maryland Heights, Va., and in consequence is discharged from the
service._September._--Edgar A. Griswold of Naples is recruiting a company here
for the 148th Regiment, of which he is captain.Hiram P. Brown, Henry S.
Murray and Charles H. Paddock are officers in the company.Elnathan
W. Simmons is surgeon._September_ 22.--I read aloud to Grandfather this evening the
Emancipation Proclamation issued as a war measure by President Lincoln,
to take effect January 1, liberating over three million slaves.He
recommends to all thus set free, to labor faithfully for reasonable
wages and to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary
self-defense, and he invokes upon this act "the considerate judgment of
mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God."_November_ 21.--This is my twentieth birthday.Anna wanted to write a
poem for the occasion and this morning she handed me what she called "An
effort."She said she wrestled with it all night long and could not
sleep and this was the result:

    "One hundred years from now, Carrie dear,
    In all probability you'll not be here;
    But we'll all be in the same boat, too,
    And there'll be no one left
    To say boo hoo!"Grandfather gave me for a present a set of books called "Irving's
Catechisms on Ancient Greeks and Romans."They are four little books
bound in leather, which were presented to our mother for a prize.It is
thus inscribed on the front page, "Miss Elizabeth Beals at a public
examination of the Female Boarding School in East Bloomfield, October
15, 1825, was judged to excel the school in Reading.In testimony of
which she receives this Premium from her affectionate instructress, S.I cannot imagine Grandmother sending us away to boarding school, but I
suppose she had so many children then, she could spare one or two as
well as not.She says they sent Aunt Ann to Miss Willard's school at
Troy.She wants
to know how everything goes at the Seminary and if Anna still occupies
the front seat in the school room most of the time.She says she
supposes she is quite a sedate young lady now but she hopes there is a
whole lot of the old Anna left.William H. Lamport went down to Virginia to see his
son and found that he had just died in the hospital from measles and
pneumonia.1863

_January._--Grandmother went to Aunt Mary Carr's to tea to-night, very
much to our surprise, for she seldom goes anywhere.Anna said she was
going to keep house exactly as Grandmother did, so after supper she took
a little hot water in a basin on a tray and got the tea-towels and
washed the silver and best china but she let the ivory handles on the
knives and forks get wet, so I presume they will all turn black.Grandmother never lets her little nice things go out into the kitchen,
so probably that is the reason that everything is forty years old and
yet as good as new.She let us have the Young Ladies' Aid Society here
to supper because I am President.She came into the parlor and looked at
our basket of work, which the elder ladies cut out for us to make for
the soldiers.She had the supper table set the whole length of the
dining room and let us preside at the table.Anna made the girls laugh
so, they could hardly eat, although they said everything was splendid.They said they never ate better biscuit, preserves, or fruit cake and
the coffee was delicious.After it was over, the "dear little lady" said
she hoped we had a good time.After the girls were gone Grandmother
wanted to look over the garments and see how much we had accomplished
and if we had made them well.Mary Field made a pair of drawers with No.She said she wanted them to look fine and I am sure they did.Most of us wrote notes and put inside the garments for the soldiers in
the hospitals.Sarah Gibson Howell has had an answer to her letter.His name is
Foster--a Major.She expects him to come and see her soon.All the girls wear newspaper bustles to school now and Anna's rattled
to-day and Emma Wheeler heard it and said, "What's the news, Anna?"They
both laughed out loud and found that "the latest news from the front"
was that Miss Morse kept them both after school and they had to copy
Dictionary for an hour.I paid $3.50 to-day for
a hoop skirt.T. Barnum delivered his lecture on "The Art of Money
Getting" in Bemis Hall this evening for the benefit of the Ladies' Aid
Society, which is working for the soldiers._February._--The members of our society sympathized with General
McClellan when he was criticised by some and we wrote him the following
letter:

                                            "Canandaigua, Feb.McClellan:

"Will you pardon any seeming impropriety in our addressing you, and
attribute it to the impulsive love and admiration of hearts which see in
you, the bravest and noblest defender of our Union.We cannot resist the
impulse to tell you, be our words ever so feeble, how our love and trust
have followed you from Rich Mountain to Antietam, through all slanderous
attacks of traitorous politicians and fanatical defamers--how we have
admired, not less than your calm courage on the battlefield, your lofty
scorn of those who remained at home in the base endeavor to strip from
your brow the hard earned laurels placed there by a grateful country: to
tell further, that in your forced retirement from battlefields of the
Republic's peril, you have 'but changed your country's arms for
more,--your country's heart,'--and to assure you that so long as our
country remains to us a sacred name and our flag a holy emblem, so long
shall we cherish your memory as the defender and protector of both.We
are an association whose object it is to aid, in the only way in which
woman, alas!Our sympathies are with
them in the cause for which they have periled all--our hearts are with
them in the prayer, that ere long their beloved commander may be
restored to them, and that once more as of old he may lead them to
victory in the sacred name of the Union and Constitution."With united prayers that the Father of all may have you and yours ever
in His holy keeping, we remain your devoted partisans."The following in reply was addressed to the lady whose name was first
signed to the above:

                                               "New York, Feb.Madam--I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of the very
kind letter of the 13th inst., from yourself and your friends.Will you
do me the favor to say to them how much I thank them for it, and that I
am at a loss to express my gratitude for the pleasant and cheering terms
in which it is couched.Such sentiments on the part of those whose
brothers have served with me in the field are more grateful to me than
anything else can be.I feel far more than rewarded by them for all I
have tried to accomplish.--I am, Madam, with the most sincere respect
and friendship, yours very truly,

                                                    Geo._May._--A number of the teachers and pupils of the Academy have enlisted
for the war.Among them E. C. Clarke, H. C. Kirk, A. T. Wilder, Norman
K. Martin, T. C. Parkhurst, Mr.They have a tent on the square
and are enlisting men in Canandaigua and vicinity for the 4th N. Y.
Heavy Artillery.Noah T. Clarke's mother in
Naples.She had already sent three sons, Bela, William and Joseph, to
the war and she is very sad because her youngest has now enlisted.She
says she feels as did Jacob of old when he said, "I am bereaved of my
children.Joseph is not and Simeon is not and now you will take Benjamin
away."I have heard that she is a beautiful singer but she says she
cannot sing any more until this cruel war is over.I wish that I could
write something to comfort her but I feel as Mrs.Browning puts it: "If
you want a song for your Italy free, let none look at me."Our society met at Fannie Pierce's this afternoon.Her mother is an
invalid and never gets out at all, but she is very much interested in
the soldiers and in all young people, and loves to have us come in and
see her and we love to go.She enters into the plans of all of us young
girls and has a personal interest in us.We had a very good time
to-night and Laura Chapin was more full of fun than usual.Once there
was silence for a minute or two and some one said, "awful pause."Laura
said, "I guess you would have awful paws if you worked as hard as I do."We were talking about how many of us girls would be entitled to flag bed
quilts, and according to the rules, they said that, up to date, Abbie
Clark and I were the only ones.The explanation is that Captain George
N. Williams and Lieutenant E. C. Clarke are enlisted in their country's
service.Susie Daggett is Secretary and Treasurer of the Society and she
reported that in one year's time we made in our society 133 pairs of
drawers, 101 shirts, 4 pairs socks for soldiers, and 54 garments for the
families of soldiers.Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day for two young braves
who are going to the war.William H. Adams is also commissioned Captain
and is going to the front._July_ 4.--The terrible battle of Gettysburg brings to Canandaigua sad
news of our soldier boys of the 126th Regiment.Colonel Sherrill was
instantly killed, also Captains Wheeler and Herendeen, Henry Willson and
Henry P. Cook.[Illustration: "Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day",
"Mr.Noah T. Clark's Brother and I"]

_July_ 26.--Charlie Wheeler was buried with military honors from the
Congregational church to-day.Two companies of the 54th New York State
National Guard attended the funeral, and the church was packed,
galleries and all.It was the saddest funeral and the only one of a
soldier that I ever attended.He was killed
at Gettysburg, July 3, by a sharpshooter's bullet.He was a very bright
young man, graduate of Yale college and was practising law.He was
captain of Company K, 126th N. Y. Volunteers.Morse's lecture, "You and I": "And who has forgotten that
gifted youth, who fell on the memorable field of Gettysburg?To win a
noble name, to save a beloved country, he took his place beneath the
dear old flag, and while cannon thundered and sabers clashed and the
stars of the old Union shone above his head he went down in the shock of
battle and left us desolate, a name to love and a glory to endure.And
as we solemnly know, as by the old charter of liberty we most sacredly
swear, he was truly and faithfully and religiously

    Of all our friends the noblest,
    The choicest and the purest,
    The nearest and the dearest,
      In the field at Gettysburg.Of all the heroes bravest,
    Of soul the brightest, whitest,
    Of all the warriors greatest,
      Shot dead at Gettysburg.And where the fight was thickest,
    And where the smoke was blackest,
    And where the fire was hottest,
      On the fields of Gettysburg,
    There flashed his steel the brightest,
    There blazed his eyes the fiercest,
    There flowed his blood the reddest
      On the field of Gettysburg.O music of the waters
      That flow at Gettysburg,
    Mourn tenderly the hero,
    The rare and glorious hero,
    The loved and peerless hero,
      Who died at Gettysburg.His turf shall be the greenest,
    His roses bloom the sweetest,
    His willow droop the saddest
      Of all at Gettysburg.His memory live the freshest,
    His fame be cherished longest,
    Of all the holy warriors,
      Who fell at Gettysburg.These were patriots, these were our jewels.And of every soldier who has fallen in this war his friends may
write just as lovingly as you and I may do of those to whom I pay my
feeble tribute."_August,_ 1863.--The U. S. Sanitary Commission has been organized.W. Fitch Cheney to Gettysburg with supplies for the
sick and wounded and he took seven assistants with him.Home bounty was
brought to the tents and put into the hands of the wounded soldiers._August_ 12.--Lucilla Field was married in our church to-day to Rev.I always thought she was cut out for a minister's wife.Jennie
Draper cried herself sick because Lucilla, her Sunday School teacher, is
going away._October_ 8.--News came to-day of the death of Lieutenant Hiram Brown.He died of fever at Portsmouth, only little more than a year after he
went away._November_ 1.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is stationed at Fort
Hamilton, N. Y. harbor.Uncle Edward has invited me down to New York to
spend a month!Grandfather says that I can go and Miss
Rosewarne is beginning a new dress for me to-day._November_ 6.--We were saddened to-day by news of the death of Augustus
Torrey Wilder in the hospital at Fort Ethan Allen.Grandfather and I
came from Canandaigua yesterday.We were
met by a military escort of "one" at Albany and consequently came
through more safely, I suppose.James met us at 42d Street Grand Central
Station.He lives at Uncle Edward's; attends to all of his legal
business and is his confidential clerk.They
are very stylish and grand but I don't mind that.Aunt Emily is reserved
and dignified but very kind.People do not pour their tea or coffee into
their saucers any more to cool it, but drink it from the cup, and you
must mind and not leave your teaspoon in your cup.Morris K. Jesup lives right across the
street and I see him every day, as he is a friend of Uncle Edward.Grandfather has gone back home and left me in charge of friends "a la
militaire" and others._November_ 15.--"We" went out to Fort Hamilton to-day and are going to
Blackwell's Island to-morrow and to many other places of interest down
the Bay.Soldiers are everywhere and I feel quite important, walking
around in company with blue coat and brass buttons--very becoming style
of dress for men and the military salute at every turn is what one reads
about._Sunday_.--Went to Broadway Tabernacle to church to-day and heard Rev.Abbie Clark is visiting her sister, Mrs.Fred
Thompson, and sat a few seats ahead of us in church.We also saw Henrietta Francis Talcott, who was a "Seminary
girl."She wants me to come to see her in her New York home._November_ 19.--We wish we were at Gettysburg to-day to hear President
Lincoln's and Edward Everett's addresses at the dedication of the
National Cemetery.We will read them in to-morrow's papers, but it will
not be like hearing them._Author's Note,_ 1911.--Forty-eight years have elapsed since Lincoln's
speech was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' Cemetery at
Gettysburg.So eloquent and remarkable was his utterance that I believe
I am correct in stating that every word spoken has now been translated
into all known languages and is regarded as one of the World Classics.The same may be said of Lincoln's letter to the mother of five sons lost
in battle.I make no apology for inserting in this place both the speech
and the letter.Whitelaw Reid, the American Ambassador to Great
Britain, in an address on Lincoln delivered at the University of
Birmingham in December, 1910, remarked in reference to this letter,
"What classic author in our common English tongue has surpassed that?"and next may I ask, "What English or American orator has on a similar
occasion surpassed this address on the battlefield of Gettysburg?""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a great battlefield of
that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final
resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might
live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But in
a larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot
hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here--but it can
never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve, that these dead shall
not have died in vain--that this nation under God shall have a new birth
of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth."It was during the dark days of the war that he wrote this simple letter
of sympathy to a bereaved mother:--

"I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement that
you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of
battle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which
should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming,
but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be
found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our
Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave
you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn
pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the
altar of Freedom."_November_ 21.--Abbie Clark and her cousin Cora came to call and invited
me and her soldier cousin to come to dinner to-night, at Mrs.He will be here this afternoon and I will give him the
invitation._November_ 22.--We had a delightful visit.Thompson took us up into
his den and showed us curios from all over the world and as many
pictures as we would find in an art gallery._Friday_.--Last evening Uncle Edward took a party of us, including Abbie
Clark, to Wallack's Theater to see "Rosedale," which is having a great
run.I enjoyed it and told James it was the best play I ever "heard."He
said I must not say that I "heard" a play.I told James that I heard of a young girl who went abroad and on her
return some one asked her if she saw King Lear and she said, no, he was
sick all the time she was there!I just loved the play last night and
laughed and cried in turn, it seemed so real.I don't know what
Grandmother will say, but I wrote her about it and said, "When you are
with the Romans, you must do as the Romans do."I presume she will say
"that is not the way you were brought up."_December_ 7.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery has orders to move to
Fort Ethan Allen, near Washington, and I have orders to return to
Canandaigua.I have enjoyed the five weeks very much and as "the
soldier" was on parole most of the time I have seen much of interest in
the city.Uncle Edward says that he has lived here forty years but has
never visited some of the places that we have seen, so he told me when I
mentioned climbing to the top of Trinity steeple.Canandaigua, _December_ 8.--Home again.I had military attendance as far
as Paterson, N. J., and came the rest of the way with strangers.Not
caring to talk I liked it just as well.When I said good bye I could not
help wondering whether it was for years, or forever.This cruel war is
terrible and precious lives are being sacrificed and hearts broken every
day._Christmas Eve,_ 1863.--Sarah Gibson Howell was married to Major Foster
this evening.It was a
beautiful wedding and we all enjoyed it.Some time ago I asked her to
write in my album and she sewed a lock of her black curling hair on the
page and in the center of it wrote, "Forget not Gippie."_December_ 31.--Our brother John was married in Boston to-day to Laura
Arnold, a lovely girl.1864

_April_ 1.--Grandfather had decided to go to New York to attend the fair
given by the Sanitary Commission, and he is taking two immense books,
which are more than one hundred years old, to present to the Commission,
for the benefit of the war fund._April_ 18.--Grandfather returned home to-day, unexpectedly to us.I
knew he was sick when I met him at the door.He had traveled all night
alone from New York, although he said that a stranger, a fellow
passenger, from Ann Arbor, Mich., on the train noticed that he was
suffering and was very kind to him.He said he fell in his room at
Gramercy Park Hotel in the night, and his knee was very painful.Cheney and he said the hurt was a serious one and needed
most careful attention.I was invited to a spelling school at Abbie
Clark's in the evening and Grandmother said that she and Anna would take
care of Grandfather till I got back, and then I could sit up by him the
rest of the night.We spelled down and had quite a merry time.Major C.
S. Aldrich had escaped from prison and was there.He came home with me,
as my soldier is down in Virginia._April_ 19.--Grandfather is much worse.Lightfoote has come to
stay with us all the time and we have sent for Aunt Glorianna._April_ 20.--Grandfather dictated a letter to-night to a friend of his
in New York.After I had finished he asked me if I had mended his
gloves.I said no, but I would have them ready when he wanted them.he looks so sick I fear he will never wear his gloves
again._May_ 16.--I have not written in my diary for a month and it has been
the saddest month of my life.He was
buried May 2, just two weeks from the day that he returned from New
York.We did everything for him that could be done, but at the end of
the first week the doctors saw that he was beyond all human aid.Uncle
Thomas told the doctors that they must tell him.He was much surprised
but received the verdict calmly.He said "he had no notes out and
perhaps it was the best time to go."He had taught us how to live and he
seemed determined to show us how a Christian should die.He said he
wanted "Grandmother and the children to come to him and have all the
rest remain outside."When we came into the room he said to Grandmother,
"Do you know what the doctors say?"She bowed her head, and then he
motioned for her to come on one side and Anna and me on the other and
kneel by his bedside.He placed a hand upon us and upon her and said to
her, "All the rest seem very much excited, but you and I must be
composed."Then he asked us to say the 23d Psalm, "The Lord is my
Shepherd," and then all of us said the Lord's Prayer together after
Grandmother had offered a little prayer for grace and strength in this
trying hour.Then he said, "Grandmother, you must take care of the
girls, and, girls, you must take care of Grandmother."We felt as though
our hearts would break and were sure we never could be happy again.During the next few days he often spoke of dying and of what we must do
when he was gone.Once when I was sitting by him he looked up and smiled
and said, "You will lose all your roses watching over me."A good many
business men came in to see him to receive his parting blessing.The two
McKechnie brothers, Alexander and James, came in together on their way
home from church the Sunday before he died.He lived until Saturday, the 30th, and in the morning he said, "Open the
door wide."We did so and he said, "Let the King of Glory enter in."Very soon after he said, "I am going home to Paradise," and then sank
into that sleep which on this earth knows no waking.I sat by the window
near his bed and watched the rain beat into the grass and saw the
peonies and crocuses and daffodils beginning to come up out of the
ground and I thought to myself, I shall never see the flowers come up
again without thinking of these sad, sad days.He was buried Monday
afternoon, May 2, from the Congregational church, and Dr.Daggett
preached a sermon from a favorite text of Grandfather's, "I shall die in
my nest."James and John came and as we stood with dear Grandmother and
all the others around his open grave and heard Dr.Daggett say in his
beautiful sympathetic voice, "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust," we felt that we were losing our best friend; but he told us that
we must live for Grandmother and so we will.The next Sabbath, Anna and I were called out of church by a messenger,
who said that Grandmother was taken suddenly ill and was dying.When we
reached the house attendants were all about her administering
restoratives, but told us she was rapidly sinking.I asked if I might
speak to her and was reluctantly permitted, as they thought best not to
disturb her.I sat down by her and with tearful voice said,
"Grandmother, don't you know that Grandfather said we were to care for
you and you were to care for us and if you die we cannot do as
Grandfather said?"She opened her eyes and looked at me and said
quietly, "Dry your eyes, child, I shall not die to-day or to-morrow."Inscribed in my diary:

    "They are passing away, they are passing away,
    Not only the young, but the aged and gray.Their places are vacant, no longer we see
    The armchair in waiting, as it used to be.The hat and the coat are removed from the nail,
    Where for years they have hung, every day without fail.The shoes and the slippers are needed no more,
    Nor kept ready waiting, as they were of yore,
    The desk which he stood at in manhood's fresh prime,
    Which now shows the marks of the finger of time,
    The bright well worn keys, which were childhood's delight
    Unlocking the treasures kept hidden from sight.These now are mementoes of him who has passed,
    Who stands there no longer, as we saw him last.Other hands turn the keys, as he did, before,
    Other eyes will his secrets, if any, explore.The step once elastic, but feeble of late,
    No longer we watch for through doorway or gate,
    Though often we turn, half expecting to see,
    The loved one approaching, but ah!We miss him at all times, at morn when we meet,
    For the social repast, there is one vacant seat.At noon, and at night, at the hour of prayer,
    Our hearts fill with sadness, one voice is not there.Yet not without hope his departure we mourn,
    In faith and in trust, all our sorrows are borne,
    Borne upward to Him who in kindness and love
    Sends earthly afflictions to draw us above.Thus hoping and trusting, rejoicing, we'll go,
    Both upward and onward through weal and through woe
    'Till all of life's changes and conflicts are past
    Beyond the dark river, to meet him at last."In Memoriam

Thomas Beals died in Canandaigua, N. Y., on Saturday, April 30th, 1864,
in the 81st year of his age.Beals was born in Boston, Mass.,
November 13, 1783.He came to this village in October, 1803, only 14 years after the first
settlement of the place.He was married in March, 1805, to Abigail
Field, sister of the first pastor of the Congregational church here.Her
family, in several of its branches, have since been distinguished in the
ministry, the legal profession, and in commercial enterprise.Living to a good old age, and well known as one of our most wealthy and
respected citizens, Mr.Beals is another added to the many examples of
successful men who, by energy and industry, have made their own fortune.On coming to this village, he was teacher in the Academy for a time, and
afterward entered into mercantile business, in which he had his share of
vicissitude.When the Ontario Savings Bank was established, 1832, he
became the Treasurer, and managed it successfully till the institution
ceased, in 1835, with his withdrawal.In the meantime he conducted,
also, a banking business of his own, and this was continued until a week
previous to his death, when he formally withdrew, though for the last
five years devolving its more active duties upon his son.As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for him the confidence and
respect of all classes of persons in this community.The business
portion of our village is very much indebted to his enterprise for the
eligible structures he built that have more than made good the losses
sustained by fires.More than fifty years ago he was actively concerned
in the building of the Congregational church, and also superintended the
erection of the county jail and almshouse; for many years a trustee of
Canandaigua Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the Congregational
church.At the time of his death he and his wife, who survives him, were
the oldest members of the church, having united with it in 1807, only
eight years after its organization.Until hindered by the infirmities of
age, he was a constant attendant of its services and ever devoutly
maintained the worship of God in his family.No person has been more
generally known among all classes of our citizens.Whether at home or
abroad he could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and dignity.His
character was original, independent, and his manners remarkable for a
dignified courtesy.Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic
answers with the wave of his hand.He was fond of books, a great reader,
collected a valuable number of volumes, and was happy in the use of
language both in writing and conversation.In many unusual ways he often
showed his kind consideration for the poor and afflicted, and many
persons hearing of his death gratefully recollect instances, not known
to others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.In his
charities he often studied concealment as carefully as others court
display.His marked individuality of character and deportment, together
with his shrewd discernment and active habits, could not fail to leave a
distinct impression on the minds of all.For more than sixty years he transacted business in one place here, and
his long life thus teaches more than one generation the value of
sobriety, diligence, fidelity and usefulness.In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he always loved
Canandaigua; had done several things for its prosperity, and had
intended to do more.He had known his measure of affliction; only four
of eleven children survive him, but children and children's children
ministered to the comfort of his last days.Notwithstanding his years
and infirmities, he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th
quite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal termination.As the
final event drew near, he seemed happily prepared to meet it.He
conversed freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened and
benignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting benedictions.His end
seemed to realize his favorite citation from Job: "I shall die in my
nest."His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational church by a
large assembly, Dr.Daggett, the pastor, officiating on the
occasion.--Written by Dr.O. E. Daggett in 1864._May._--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is having hard times in the
Virginia mud and rain.It is such a change from
their snug winter quarters at Fort Ethan Allen.There are 2,800 men in
the Regiment and 1,200 are sick.Charles S. Hoyt of the 126th, which
is camping close by, has come to the help of these new recruits so
kindly as to win every heart, quite in contrast to the heartlessness of
their own surgeons._June_ 22.--Captain Morris Brown, of Penn Yan, was killed to-day by a
musket shot in the head, while commanding the regiment before
Petersburg._June_ 23, 1864.--Anna graduated last Thursday, June 16, and was
valedictorian of her class.There were eleven girls in the class, Ritie
Tyler, Mary Antes, Jennie Robinson, Hattie Paddock, Lillie Masters,
Abbie Hills, Miss McNair, Miss Pardee and Miss Palmer, Miss Jasper and
Anna.The subject of her essay was "The Last Time."I will copy an
account of the exercises as they appeared in this week's village paper.A WORD FROM AN OLD MAN

"Mr.Editor:

"Less than a century ago I was traveling through this enchanted region
and accidentally heard that it was commencement week at the seminary.My venerable appearance seemed to command respect and I received
many attentions.I presented my snowy head and patriarchal beard at the
doors of the sacred institution and was admitted.I heard all the
classes, primary, secondary, tertiary, et cetera.I
rose early, dressed with much care.I affectionately pressed the hands
of my two landlords and left.When I arrived at the seminary I saw at a
glance that it was a place where true merit was appreciated.I was
invited to a seat among the dignitaries, but declined.I am a modest
man, I always was.I recognized the benign Principals of the school.You
can find no better principles in the states than in Ontario Female
Seminary.After the report of the committee a very lovely young lady
arose and saluted us in Latin.As she proceeded, I thought the grand
old Roman tongue had never sounded so musically and when she pronounced
the decree, 'Richmond delenda est,' we all hoped it might be prophetic.Then followed the essays of the other young ladies and then every one
waited anxiously for 'The Last Time.'The story was
beautifully told, the adieux were tenderly spoken.We saw the withered
flowers of early years scattered along the academic ways, and the golden
fruit of scholarly culture ripening in the gardens of the future.Enchanted by the sorrowful eloquence, bewildered by the melancholy
brilliancy, I sent a rosebud to the charming valedictorian and wandered
out into the grounds.I went to the concert in the evening and was
pleased and delighted.I shall return next year unless
the gout carries me off.I hope I shall hear just such beautiful music,
see just such beautiful faces and dine at the same excellent hotel.Anna closed her valedictory with these words:

"May we meet at one gate when all's over;
  The ways they are many and wide,
And seldom are two ways the same;
  Side by side may we stand
At the same little door when all's done.The ways they are many,
    The end it is one."_July_ 10.--We have had word of the death of Spencer F. Lincoln._August._--The New York State S. S. Convention was held in Buffalo and
among others Fanny Gaylord, Mary Field and myself attended.We had a
fine time and were entertained at the home of Mr.Her
mother is living with her, a dear old lady who was Judge Atwater's
daughter and used to go to school to Grandfather Beals.We went with
other delegates on an excursion to Niagara Falls and went into the
express office at the R. R. station to see Grant Schley, who is express
agent there.He said it seemed good to see so many home faces._September_ 1.--My war letters come from Georgetown Hospital now.Noah T. Clarke is very anxious and sends telegrams to Andrew Chesebro
every day to go and see his brother._September_ 30.--To-day the "Benjamin" of the family reached home under
the care of Dr.J. Byron Hayes, who was sent to Washington after him.Noah T. Clarke's to see him and found him just a shadow
of his former self.However, "hope springs eternal in the human breast"
and he says he knows he will soon be well again.This is his thirtieth
birthday and it is glorious that he can spend it at home.Noah T. Clarke accompanied his brother to-day to the
old home in Naples and found two other soldier brothers, William and
Joseph, had just arrived on leave of absence from the army so the
mother's heart sang "Praise God from whom all blessings flow."The
fourth brother has also returned to his home in Illinois, disabled._November._--They are holding Union Revival Services in town now.One
evangelist from out of town said he would call personally at the homes
and ask if all were Christians.Anna told Grandmother if he came here
she should tell him about her.Grandmother said we must each give an
account for ourselves.Anna said she should tell him about her little
Grandmother anyway.We saw him coming up the walk about 11 a.m.and Anna
went to the door and asked him in.They sat down in the parlor and he
remarked about the pleasant weather and Canandaigua such a beautiful
town and the people so cultured.She said yes, she found the town every
way desirable and the people pleasant, though she had heard it remarked
that strangers found it hard to get acquainted and that you had to have
a residence above the R. R. track and give a satisfactory answer as to
who your Grandfather was, before admittance was granted to the best
society.He asked
her how long she had lived here and she told him nearly all of her brief
existence!She said if he had asked her how old she was she would have
told him she was so young that Will Adams last May was appointed her
guardian.He asked how many there were in the family and she said her
Grandmother, her sister and herself.He said, "They are Christians, I
suppose.""Yes," she said, "my sister is a S. S. teacher and my
Grandmother was born a Christian, about 80 years ago."Anna said she would have to be excused
as she seldom saw company.When he arose to go he said, "My dear young
lady, I trust that you are a Christian.""Mercy yes," she said, "years
ago."He said he was very glad and hoped she would let her light shine.She said that was what she was always doing--that the other night at a
revival meeting she sang every verse of every hymn and came home feeling
as though she had herself personally rescued by hand at least fifty
"from sin and the grave."He smiled approvingly and bade her good bye.She told Grandmother she presumed he would say "he had not found so
great faith, no not in Israel."George Wilson leads and
instructs us on the Sunday School lesson for the following Sunday.Wilson knows
Barnes' notes, Cruden's Concordance, the Westminster Catechism and the
Bible from beginning to end.1865

_March_ 5.--I have just read President Lincoln's second inaugural
address.It only takes five minutes to read it but, oh, how much it
contains._March_ 20.--Hardly a day passes that we do not hear news of Union
victories.Every one predicts that the war is nearly at an end._March_ 29.--An officer arrived here from the front yesterday and he
said that, on Saturday morning, shortly after the battle commenced which
resulted so gloriously for the Union in front of Petersburg, President
Lincoln, accompanied by General Grant and staff, started for the
battlefield, and reached there in time to witness the close of the
contest and the bringing in of the prisoners.His presence was
immediately recognized and created the most intense enthusiasm.He
afterwards rode over the battlefield, listened to the report of General
Parke to General Grant, and added his thanks for the great service
rendered in checking the onslaught of the rebels and in capturing so
many of their number.I read this morning the order of Secretary Stanton
for the flag raising on Fort Sumter.It reads thus: "War department,
Adjutant General's office, Washington, March 27th, 1865, General Orders
No.Ordered, first: That at the hour of noon, on the 14th day of
April, 1865, Brevet Major General Anderson will raise and plant upon the
ruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the same U. S. Flag which
floated over the battlements of this fort during the rebel assault, and
which was lowered and saluted by him and the small force of his command
when the works were evacuated on the 14th day of April, 1861.Second,
That the flag, when raised be saluted by 100 guns from Fort Sumter and
by a national salute from every fort and rebel battery that fired upon
Fort Sumter.Third, That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion,
under the direction of Major-General William T. Sherman, whose military
operations compelled the rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his
absence, under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gillmore, commanding
the department.Among the ceremonies will be the delivery of a public
address by the Rev.Fourth, That the naval forces at
Charleston and their Commander on that station be invited to participate
in the ceremonies of the occasion.By order of the President of the
United States.E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War."_April,_ 1865.--What a month this has been.On the 6th of April Governor
Fenton issued this proclamation: "Richmond has fallen.The wicked men
who governed the so-called Confederate States have fled their capital,
shorn of their power and influence.The rebel armies have been defeated,
broken and scattered.Victory everywhere attends our banners and our
armies, and we are rapidly moving to the closing scenes of the war.Through the self-sacrifice and heroic devotion of our soldiers, the life
of the republic has been saved and the American Union preserved.I,
Reuben E. Fenton, Governor of the State of New York, do designate
Friday, the 14th of April, the day appointed for the ceremony of raising
the United States flag on Fort Sumter, as a day of Thanksgiving, prayer
and praise to Almighty God, for the signal blessings we have received at
His hands."_Saturday, April_ 8.--The cannon has fired a salute of thirty-six guns
to celebrate the fall of Richmond.This evening the streets were
thronged with men, women and children all acting crazy as if they had
not the remotest idea where they were or what they were doing.Atwater
block was beautifully lighted and the band was playing in front of it.On the square they fired guns, and bonfires were lighted in the streets.Clark's house was lighted from the very garret and they had a
transparency in front, with "Richmond" on it, which Fred Thompson made.We didn't even light "our other candle," for Grandmother said she
preferred to keep Saturday night and pity and pray for the poor
suffering, wounded soldiers, who are so apt to be forgotten in the hour
of victory._Sunday Evening, April_ 9.--There were great crowds at church this
morning.Daggett's text was from Prov.18: 10: "The name of the Lord
is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe."They sang hymns relating to our country and Dr.Daggett's prayers were full of thanksgiving.Noah T. Clarke had the
chapel decorated with flags and opened the Sunday School by singing,
"Marching On," "My Country, 'tis of Thee," "The Star Spangled Banner,"
"Glory, Hallelujah," etc.H. Lamport talked very pleasantly and
paid a very touching tribute to the memory of the boys, who had gone out
to defend their country, who would never come "marching home again."He
lost his only son, 18 years old (in the 126th), about two years ago.I
sat near Mary and Emma Wheeler and felt so sorry for them._Monday Morning, April_ 10.--"Whether I am in the body, or out of the
body, I know not, but one thing I know," Lee has surrendered!and all
the people seem crazy in consequence.The bells are ringing, boys and
girls, men and women are running through the streets wild with
excitement; the flags are all flying, one from the top of our church,
and such a "hurrah boys" generally, I never dreamed of.We were quietly
eating our breakfast this morning about 7 o'clock, when our church bell
commenced to ring, then the Methodist bell, and now all the bells in
town are ringing.Noah T. Clarke ran by, all excitement, and I don't
believe he knows where he is.Aldrich
passing, so I rushed to the window and he waved his hat.I raised the
window and asked him what was the matter?He came to the front door
where I met him and he almost shook my hand off and said, "The war is
over.We have Lee's surrender, with his own name signed."I am going
down town now, to see for myself, what is going on.Later--I have
returned and I never saw such performances in my life.Every man has a
bell or a horn, and every girl a flag and a little bell, and every one
is tied with red, white and blue ribbons.I am going down town again
now, with my flag in one hand and bell in the other and make all the
noise I can.Noah T. Clarke and other leading citizens are riding
around on a dray cart with great bells in their hands ringing them as
hard as they can.The latest musical
instrument invented is called the "Jerusalem fiddle."Some boys put a
dry goods box upon a cart, put some rosin on the edge of the box and
pulled a piece of timber back and forth across it, making most unearthly
sounds.They drove through all the streets, Ed Lampman riding on the
horse and driving it._Monday evening, April_ 10.--I have been out walking for the last hour
and a half, looking at the brilliant illuminations, transparencies and
everything else and I don't believe I was ever so tired in my life.The
bells have not stopped ringing more than five minutes all day and every
one is glad to see Canandaigua startled out of its propriety for once.Every yard of red, white and blue ribbon in the stores has been sold,
also every candle and every flag.One society worked hard all the
afternoon making transparencies and then there were no candles to put in
to light them, but they will be ready for the next celebration when
peace is proclaimed.The Court House, Atwater Block, and hotel have
about two dozen candles in each window throughout, besides flags and
mottoes of every description.It is certainly the best impromptu display
ever gotten up in this town."Victory is Grant-ed," is in large red,
white and blue letters in front of Atwater Block.The speeches on the
square this morning were all very good.Daggett commenced with
prayer, and such a prayer, I wish all could have heard it.Francis
Granger, E. G. Lapham, Judge Smith, Alexander Howell, Noah T. Clarke and
others made speeches and we sang "Old Hundred" in conclusion, and Rev.Hibbard dismissed us with the benediction.Noah T. Clarke, but he told me to be careful and not hurt him, for he
blistered his hands to-day ringing that bell.He says he is going to
keep the bell for his grandchildren.Between the speeches on the square
this morning a song was called for and Gus Coleman mounted the steps and
started "John Brown" and all the assembly joined in the chorus, "Glory,
Hallelujah."This has been a never to be forgotten day._April_ 15.--The news came this morning that our dear president, Abraham
Lincoln, was assassinated yesterday, on the day appointed for
thanksgiving for Union victories.I have felt sick over it all day and
so has every one that I have seen.All seem to feel as though they had
lost a personal friend, and tears flow plenteously.How soon has sorrow
followed upon the heels of joy!One week ago to-night we were
celebrating our victories with loud acclamations of mirth and good
cheer.Now every one is silent and sad and the earth and heavens seem
clothed in sack-cloth.The
flags are all at half mast, draped with mourning, and on every store and
dwelling-house some sign of the nation's loss is visible.Just after
breakfast this morning, I looked out of the window and saw a group of
men listening to the reading of a morning paper, and I feared from their
silent, motionless interest that something dreadful had happened, but I
was not prepared to hear of the cowardly murder of our President.And
William H. Seward, too, I suppose cannot survive his wounds.I went down town shortly after I heard the news, and it
was wonderful to see the effect of the intelligence upon everybody,
small or great, rich or poor.Every one was talking low, with sad and
anxious looks.But we know that God still reigns and will do what is
best for us all.Perhaps we're "putting our trust too much in princes,"
forgetting the Great Ruler, who alone can create or destroy, and
therefore He has taken from us the arm of flesh that we may lean more
confidingly and entirely upon Him.I trust that the men who committed
these foul deeds will soon be brought to justice._Sunday, Easter Day, April_ 16.--I went to church this morning.The
pulpit and choir-loft were covered with flags festooned with crape.Although a very disagreeable day, the house was well filled.The first
hymn sung was "Oh God our help in ages past, our hope for years to
come."Daggett's prayer, I can never forget, he alluded so
beautifully to the nation's loss, and prayed so fervently that the God
of our fathers might still be our God, through every calamity or
affliction, however severe or mysterious.All seemed as deeply affected
as though each one had been suddenly bereft of his best friend.The hymn
sung after the prayer, commenced with "Yes, the Redeemer rose."Daggett said that he had intended to preach a sermon upon the
resurrection.He read the psalm beginning, "Lord, Thou hast been our
dwelling-place in all generations."His text was "That our faith and
hope might be in God."He commenced by saying, "I feel as you feel this
morning: our sad hearts have all throbbed in unison since yesterday
morning when the telegram announced to us Abraham Lincoln is shot."He
said the last week would never be forgotten, for never had any of us
seen one come in with so much joy, that went out with so much sorrow.His whole sermon related to the President's life and death, and, in
conclusion, he exhorted us not to be despondent, for he was confident
that the ship of state would not go down, though the helmsman had
suddenly been taken away while the promised land was almost in view.He
prayed for our new President, that he might be filled with grace and
power from on High, to perform his high and holy trust.On Thursday we
are to have a union meeting in our church, but it will not be the day of
general rejoicing and thanksgiving we expected.In Sunday school the desk was draped with mourning, and
the flag at half-mast was also festooned with crape.Noah T. Clarke
opened the exercises with the hymn "He leadeth me," followed by "Though
the days are dark with sorrow," "We know not what's before us," "My days
are gliding swiftly by."Clarke said that we always meant to
sing "America," after every victory, and last Monday he was wondering if
we would not have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse, but our
feelings have changed since then.Nevertheless he thought we had better
sing "America," for we certainly ought to love our country more than
ever, now that another, and such another, martyr, had given up his life
for it.Then he talked to the children and said that last
Friday was supposed to be the anniversary of the day upon which our Lord
was crucified, and though, at the time the dreadful deed was committed,
every one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth ever knew; yet
since then, the day has been called "Good Friday," for it was the death
of Christ which gave life everlasting to all the people.So he thought
that life would soon come out of darkness, which now overshadows us all,
and that the death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove the nation's life
in God's own most mysterious way._Wednesday evening, April_ 19, 1865.--This being the day set for the
funeral of Abraham Lincoln at Washington, it was decided to hold the
service to-day, instead of Thursday, as previously announced in the
Congregational church.All places of business were closed and the bells
of the village churches tolled from half past ten till eleven o'clock.It is the fourth anniversary of the first bloodshed of the war at
Baltimore.It was said to-day, that while the services were being held
in the White House and Lincoln's body lay in state under the dome of the
capitol, that more than twenty-five millions of people all over the
civilized world were gathered in their churches weeping over the death
of the martyred President.We met at our church at half after ten
o'clock this morning.The bells tolled until eleven o'clock, when the
services commenced.The church was beautifully decorated with flags and
black and white cloth, wreaths, mottoes and flowers, the galleries and
all.There was a shield beneath the arch of
the pulpit with this text upon it: "The memory of the just is blessed."Under the choir-loft the picture of Abraham Lincoln
hung amid the flags and drapery.The motto, beneath the gallery, was
this text: "Know ye that the Lord He is God."The four pastors of the
place walked in together and took seats upon the platform, which was
constructed for the occasion.The choir chanted "Lord, Thou hast been
our dwelling-place in all generations," and then the Episcopal rector,
Rev.Leffingwell, read from the psalter, and Rev.Daggett
followed with prayer.Judge Taylor was then called upon for a short
address, and he spoke well, as he always does.The choir sang "God is
our refuge and our strength."_Thursday, April_ 20.--The papers are full of the account of the funeral
obsequies of President Lincoln.We take Harper's Weekly and every event
is pictured so vividly it seems as though we were eye witnesses of it
all.The picture of "Lincoln at home" is beautiful.What a dear, kind
man he was.It is a comfort to know that the assassination was not the
outcome of an organized plot of Southern leaders, but rather a
conspiracy of a few fanatics, who undertook in this way to avenge the
defeat of their cause.It is rumored that one of the conspirators has
been located._April_ 24.--Fannie Gaylord and Kate Lapham have returned from their
eastern trip and told us of attending the President's funeral in Albany,
and I had a letter from Bessie Seymour, who is in New York, saying that
she walked in the procession until half past two in the morning, in
order to see his face.They say that they never saw him in life, but in
death he looked just as all the pictures represent him.We all wear
Lincoln badges now, with pin attached.They are pictures of Lincoln upon
a tiny flag, bordered with crape.Susie Daggett has just made herself a
flag, six feet by four.Noah T. Clarke gave
one to her husband upon his birthday, April 8.I think everybody ought
to own a flag._April_ 26.--Now we have the news that J. Wilkes Booth, who shot the
President and who has been concealing himself in Virginia, has been
caught, and refusing to surrender was shot dead.It has taken just
twelve days to bring him to retribution.I am glad that he is dead if he
could not be taken alive, but it seems as though shooting was too good
for him.However, we may as well take this as really God's way, as the
death of the President, for if he had been taken alive, the country
would have been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces the
turmoil would have been great and desperate.It may be the best way to
dispose of him.Of course, it is best, or it would not be so.Morse
called this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by a lot of cowards.The flags have been flying all day, since the news came, but all,
excepting Albert Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead of
being shot dead.Albert seems able to look into the "beyond" and also to
locate departed spirits.His "latest" is that he is so glad that Booth
got to h--l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.Fred Thompson went down to New York last Saturday and while stopping
a few minutes at St.Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the death
of the President.Thompson marched up to him, collared him and
landed him nicely in the gutter.The bystanders were delighted and
carried the champion to a platform and called for a speech, which was
given.Every one who hears the story, says:
"Three cheers for F. F.The other afternoon at our society Kate Lapham wanted to divert our
minds from gossip I think, and so started a discussion upon the
respective characters of Washington and Napoleon.It was just after
supper and Laura Chapin was about resuming her sewing and she exclaimed,
"Speaking of Washington, makes me think that I ought to wash my hands,"
so she left the room for that purpose._May_ 7.--Anna and I wore our new poke bonnets to church this morning
and thought we looked quite "scrumptious," but Grandmother said after we
got home, if she had realized how unbecoming they were to us and to the
house of the Lord, she could not have countenanced them enough to have
sat in the same pew.Daggett in his
text, "It is good for us to be here."It was the first time in a month
that he had not preached about the affairs of the Nation.In the afternoon the Sacrament was administered and Rev.A. D. Eddy, D.
D., who was pastor from 1823 to 1835, was present and officiated.Deacon
Castle and Deacon Hayes passed the communion.Eddy concluded the
services with some personal memories.He said that forty-two years ago
last November, he presided upon a similar occasion for the first time in
his life and it was in this very church.He is now the only surviving
male member who was present that day, but there are six women living,
and Grandmother is one of the six.The Monthly Concert of Prayer for Missions was held in the chapel in the
evening.Daggett told us that the collection taken for missions
during the past year amounted to $500.He commended us and said it was
the largest sum raised in one year for this purpose in the twenty years
of his pastorate.Eddy then said that in contrast he would tell us
that the collection for missions the first year he was here, amounted to
$5, and that he was advised to touch very lightly upon the subject in
his appeals as it was not a popular theme with the majority of the
people.One member, he said, annexed three ciphers to his name when
asked to subscribe to a missionary document which was circulated, and
another man replied thus to an appeal for aid in evangelizing a portion
of Asia: "If you want to send a missionary to Jerusalem, Yates county, I
will contribute, but not a cent to go to the other side of the world."C. H. A. Buckley was present also and gave an interesting talk.By
way of illustration, he said he knew a small boy who had been earning
twenty-five cents a week for the heathen by giving up eating butter.The
other day he seemed to think that his generosity, as well as his
self-denial, had reached the utmost limit and exclaimed as he sat at the
table, "I think the heathen have had gospel enough, please pass the
butter."_May_ 10.--Jeff Davis was captured to-day at Irwinsville, Ga., when he
was attempting to escape in woman's apparel.Green drew a picture of
him, and Mr.We bought one as a
souvenir of the war.The big headlines in the papers this morning say, "The hunt is up.He
brandisheth a bowie-knife but yieldeth to six solid arguments.At
Irwinsville, Ga., about daylight on the 10th instant, Col.Prichard,
commanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry, captured Jeff Davis, family and
staff.They will be forwarded under strong guard without delay."The
flags have been flying all day, and every one is about as pleased over
the manner of his capture as over the fact itself.Lieutenant Hathaway,
one of the staff, is a friend of Mr.Manning Wells, and he was pretty
sure he would follow Davis, so we were not surprised to see his name
among the captured.Wells says he is as fine a horseman as he ever
saw._Monday evg., May_ 22.--I went to Teachers' meeting at Mrs.George Willson is the leader and she told
us at the last meeting to be prepared this evening to give our opinion
in regard to the repentance of Solomon before he died.We concluded that
he did repent although the Bible does not absolutely say so.Grandmother
thinks such questions are unprofitable, as we would better be repenting
of our sins, instead of hunting up Solomon's at this late day._May_ 23.--We arise about 5:30 nowadays and Anna does not like it very
well.I asked her why she was not as good natured as usual to-day and
she said it was because she got up "s'urly."She thinks Solomon must
have been acquainted with Grandmother when he wrote "She ariseth while
it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her
maidens."Patrick Burns, the "poet," who has also been our man of all
work the past year, has left us to go into Mr.He
seemed to feel great regret when he bade us farewell and told us he
never lived in a better regulated home than ours and he hoped his
successor would take the same interest in us that he had.He left one of his poems as a souvenir.It is entitled, "There will soon be an end to the war," written in
March, hence a prophecy.Morse had read it and pronounced it
"tip top."It was mostly written in capitals and I asked him if he
followed any rule in regard to their use.He said "Oh, yes, always begin
a line with one and then use your own discretion with the rest."_May_ 25.--I wish that I could have been in Washington this week, to
have witnessed the grand review of Meade's and Sherman's armies.The
newspaper accounts are most thrilling.The review commenced on Tuesday
morning and lasted two days.It took over six hours for Meade's army to
pass the grand stand, which was erected in front of the President's
house.It was witnessed by the President, Generals Grant, Meade, and
Sherman, Secretary Stanton, and many others in high authority.At ten
o'clock, Wednesday morning, Sherman's army commenced to pass in review.His men did not show the signs of hardship and suffering which marked
the appearance of the Army of the Potomac.Flags were flying everywhere and windows,
doorsteps and sidewalks were crowded with people, eager to get a view of
the grand armies.The city was as full of strangers, who had come to see
the sight, as on Inauguration Day.Very soon, all that are left of the
companies, who went from here, will be marching home, "with glad and
gallant tread."_June_ 3.--I was invited up to Sonnenberg yesterday and Lottie and Abbie
Clark called for me at 5:30 p.m., with their pony and democrat wagon.Jennie Rankine was the only other lady present and, for a wonder, the
party consisted of six gentlemen and five ladies, which has not often
been the case during the war.After supper we adjourned to the lawn and
played croquet, a new game which Mr.It is something like billiards, only a mallet is used instead of a
cue to hit the balls.I did not like it very well, because I couldn't
hit the balls through the wickets as I wanted to."We" sang all the
songs, patriotic and sentimental, that we could think of.Lyon came to call upon me to-day, before he returned to New York.I told him that I regretted that I could
not sing yesterday, when all the others did, and that the reason that I
made no attempts in that line was due to the fact that one day in
church, when I thought I was singing a very good alto, my grandfather
whispered to me, and said: "Daughter, you are off the key," and ever
since then, I had sung with the spirit and with the understanding, but
not with my voice.He said perhaps I could get some one to do my singing
for me, some day.I told him he was very kind to give me so much
encouragement.Anna went to a Y.M.C.A.meeting last evening at our
chapel and said, when the hymn "Rescue the perishing," was given out,
she just "raised her Ebenezer" and sang every verse as hard as she
could.The meeting was called in behalf of a young man who has been
around town for the past few days, with only one arm, who wants to be a
minister and sells sewing silk and needles and writes poetry during
vacation to help himself along.I have had a cough lately and
Grandmother decided yesterday to send for the doctor.He placed me in a
chair and thumped my lungs and back and listened to my breathing while
Grandmother sat near and watched him in silence, but finally she said,
"Caroline isn't used to being pounded!"The doctor smiled and said he
would be very careful, but the treatment was not so severe as it seemed.After he was gone, we asked Grandmother if she liked him and she said
yes, but if she had known of his "new-fangled" notions and that he wore
a full beard she might not have sent for him!Carr was
clean-shaven and also Grandfather and Dr.Daggett, and all of the
Grangers, she thinks that is the only proper way.What a funny little
lady she is!_June_ 8.--There have been unusual attractions down town for the past
two days.a man belonging to the
Ravel troupe walked a rope, stretched across Main street from the third
story of the Webster House to the chimney of the building opposite.He
is said to be Blondin's only rival and certainly performed some
extraordinary feats.Then
took a wheel-barrow across and returned with it backwards.He went
across blindfolded with a bag over his head.Then he attached a short
trapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.There were at
least 1,000 people in the street and in the windows gazing at him.Grandmother says that she thinks all such performances are wicked,
tempting Providence to win the applause of men.Nothing would induce her
to look upon such things.She is a born reformer and would abolish all
such schemes.This morning she wanted us to read the 11th chapter of
Hebrews to her, about faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,
Anna asked her what was the difference between her and Moses.Grandmother said there were many points of difference.Anna was not
found in the bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king's daughter.Anna said she was thinking how the verse read, "Moses was a proper
child," and she could not remember having ever done anything strictly
"proper" in her life.I noticed that Grandmother did not contradict her,
but only smiled._June_ 13.--Van Amburgh's circus was in town to-day and crowds attended
and many of our most highly respected citizens, but Grandmother had
other things for us to consider._June_ 16.--The census man for this town is Mr.He called
here to-day and was very inquisitive, but I think I answered all of his
questions although I could not tell him the exact amount of my property.Grandmother made us laugh to-day when we showed her a picture of the
Siamese twins, and I said, "Grandmother, if I had been their mother I
should have cut them apart when they were babies, wouldn't you?"The
dear little lady looked up so bright and said, "If I had been Mrs.Siam,
I presume I should have done just as she did."I don't believe that we
will be as amusing as she is when we are 82 years old._Saturday, July_ 8.--What excitement there must have been in Washington
yesterday over the execution of the conspirators.Surratt should have deserved hanging with the others.I saw a
picture of them all upon a scaffold and her face was screened by an
umbrella.I read in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth's broken
leg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is
glad to have nothing worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement
in Fortress Monroe.It is wonderful that 800,000 men are returning so
quietly from the army to civil life that it is scarcely known, save by
the welcome which they receive in their own homes.Buddington, of Brooklyn, preached to-day.His wife
was Miss Elizabeth Willson, Clara Coleman's sister.My Sunday School
book is "Mill on the Floss," but Grandmother says it is not Sabbath
reading, so I am stranded for the present._December_ 8.--Yesterday was Thanksgiving day.I do not remember that it
was ever observed in December before.President Johnson appointed it as
a day of national thanksgiving for our many blessings as a people, and
Governor Fenton and several governors of other states have issued
proclamations in accordance with the President's recommendation.The
weather was very unpleasant, but we attended the union thanksgiving
service held in our church.The choir sang America for the opening
piece.Daggett read Miriam's song of praise: "The Lord hath
triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea."Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent prayers, in
which the returned soldiers, many of whom are in broken health or maimed
for life, in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their country,
were tenderly remembered.His text was from the 126th Psalm, "The Lord
hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."It was one of his
best sermons.He mentioned three things in particular which the Lord has
done for us, whereof we are glad: First, that the war has closed;
second, that the Union is preserved; third, for the abolition of
slavery.After the sermon, a collection was taken for the poor, and Dr.A. D. Eddy, who was present, offered prayer.The choir sang an anthem
which they had especially prepared for the occasion, and then all joined
in the doxology.Uncle Thomas Beals' family of four united with our
three at Thanksgiving dinner.Uncle sent to New York for the oysters,
and a famous big turkey, with all the usual accompaniments, made us a
fine repast.Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together Irving's Life of
Washington, two afternoons each week.I wonder how long they will keep
it up._December_ 11.--I have been down town buying material for garments for
our Home Missionary family which we are to make in our society.Anna and
I were cutting them out and basting them ready for sewing, and
grandmother told us to save all the basting threads when we were through
with them and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another time.Anna, who says she never wants to begin anything that she cannot finish
in 15 minutes, felt rather tired at the prospect of this unexpected task
and asked Grandmother how she happened to contract such economical
ideas.Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been
wasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to
wear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother
saved the basting thread!1866

_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise
Livingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in
the Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about
the tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would
not have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made
it look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had
quite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care
of the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.Anna says
they had all the smart people in the post-office to write the
letters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one
asked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man
thronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not
write a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside
for about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent
to him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair."In ancient time the God of Wine
    They crowned with vintage of the vine,
    And sung his praise with song and glee
    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now
    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow
    With heathen emblems--better he
    Will love our gratitude to see
    Expressed in all the happy faces
    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here
    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to
clean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of
everything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this
afternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the
expenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of
thanks:

_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the
Town Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,
and the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks
to the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous
contributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public
enterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young
ladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such
generous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need
never again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as
Canandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But
our village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New
York City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and
unstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of
the hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor
would have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are
especially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their
superior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his
valuable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills
for services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who
helped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the
money is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial
visions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor
Freedmen of the South.By order of Society,
                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres't.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies' Fair in
your last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the
ladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg
the privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice
to the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February
22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the
rest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young
ladies.The skating pond was never in
better condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table
of toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I
shall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of
Washington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I
visited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I
would rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming
creatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so
tempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a
spoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans
wore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this
point my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught
a whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to
visit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I
bought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in
smoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into
a stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely
"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream
when I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright
women to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant
Havanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair
post-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost
fairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that
the young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women
lovely and useful.The
members of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,
and especially of the most devoted of their servants,
                                                            Q. E. D.

If I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie
Daggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter
catechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another
twenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do
not see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their
ambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley's--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and
Ella Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw
and Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front
seat in church at my wedding.Gooding make
individual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of
our sewing society._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson's
this afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the
young people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has
previously given the village a children's playground, a swimming school,
a hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a
park as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the
Congregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully
and Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her
house."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,
which they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days
but it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the
Union."The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie
Paul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah
Andrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,
Nannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.
Hazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,
Cornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It
kept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark's quilt and mine finished within
one month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their
nuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90
degrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,
God bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he
had always wanted a set of Clark's Commentaries, but I had carried off
the entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,
to our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop
a moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the
text, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He
leads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian
Hotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his
best and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua
hotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral
Farragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and
they all gave brief speeches.1867

_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander
Howell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to
London, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester
last evening to hear Charles Dickens' lecture, and enjoyed it more than
I can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills
distributed through the Opera House with the announcement:

                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS

    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects
    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man
who wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,
which have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a
great many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic
reception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions
that he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after
his first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that
the United States of America are quite worth while.1871

_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,
President of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air
meeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The
house was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He
ought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the
Christian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to
hundreds of dollars.1872

_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife
and me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we
expect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under
favorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were
flying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving
home and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer
from a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out
half an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking
the proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave
him three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days
on the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,
Rev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
who is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our
table and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They
held services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the
steamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly
received him into the ship."The immigrants listened eagerly, when the
minister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening
literary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever
ate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in
powdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful
flower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making
picturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the
old hymn, commencing

    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240
miles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston
Station, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,
Tavistock Square, John's residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most
bountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and
enjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the
journey, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on
the voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a
beautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury
which this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon's Tabernacle this morning to
listen to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never
looked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery
where we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as
many people over the preacher's head, as there were beneath and around
him and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the
hymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise
above."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes
and placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was
"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I
had heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in
Hyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul's Cathedral, the
Tower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud's
exhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for
the number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,
he got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,
to see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came
to see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in
this great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive
letters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would
be preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future
reference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by
cable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first
encouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most
interested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I
would, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in
my heart.She has only stepped inside the
temple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord's entrance
call.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It
does not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my
dear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting
blessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go
and smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who
holds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,
would care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received
one letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going
about London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna's letter came, after ten days, telling us all
the sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last
night before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said
how beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear
little Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field
and I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow
where we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were
about to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman
of U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like
telling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and
spirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak
a-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at
Inversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the
Trossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for
Naples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely
in Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming
city, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw
the window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also
visited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the
Abbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went
through the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the
library.Sir Walter's chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but
Laura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for
a moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our
journey that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura's sister,
Florentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are
here for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves
of the Dairyman's daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the
scene of Leigh Richmond's life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in
the surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the
donkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a
most homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream
which they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for
the present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so
glad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in
her loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,
arrived here to-day for a few days' visit.We had rather a stormy
passage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel
and he answered me "The H'Albert H'Edward, Miss!"This information must
have given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached
Calais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere
la Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just
as they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre
without seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer's, Le
Jeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous
Francais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at
which query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to
tell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two
sizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my
fingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to
make ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he
hoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the
first sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed
to and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres
bien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed
"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I
enjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue
for the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a
Presbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The
singing in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul
to joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer's praise," it seemed to me
that I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in
the refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an
eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad
her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead
him and there was no strange God with him."It was a
wonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we
noticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were
standing in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of
Sunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I
have only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an
Englishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being
so much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,
you have the 'ops, I know, but you haven't the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival
Spurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again
like a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and
nurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in
our compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised
Land," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"
and told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then
they turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that
the latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant was elected for his
second term as President of the United States.I assured them that I was
very glad to hear such good news._November_ 9.--I did not know any of the passengers when we sailed, but
soon made pleasant acquaintances.Sykes from New York and in course of conversation I found that she as
well as myself, was born in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that
her parents were members of my Father's church, which goes to prove that
the world is not so very wide after all.Abbie is a great pet among the
passengers and is being passed around from one to another from morning
till night.They love to hear her sing and coax her to say "Grace" at
table.She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly and says, "For
what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful."They
all say "Amen" to this, for they are fearful that they will not perhaps
be "thankful" when they finish!_November_ 15.--I have been on deck every day but one, and not missed a
single meal.There was a terrible storm one night and the next morning I
told one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great comfort in the
night, thinking that nothing could happen with so many of the Lord's
anointed, on board.He said that he wished he had thought of that, for
he was frightened almost to death!We have sighted eleven steamers and
on Wednesday we were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the
afternoon, our course being unusually northerly and we encountered no
fogs, contrary to the expectation of all.Every one pronounces the
voyage pleasant and speedy for this time of year._Naples, N. Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up
and with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent
two days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are
spending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of
the past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,
widow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose
maiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,
and of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of
Canandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived
nearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of
whom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the
Congregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful
supporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the
simple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age
of which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner
which repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning
grace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would
almost involuntarily 'rise up before her,' yet loved to be in her
presence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love
and peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children's
children what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to
resort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie
which bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a
deep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she
and her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in
the church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its
activity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good
work.While she was well informed in all current events, she most
delighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious
books were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her
better thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her
never saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited
the Master's call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock
of corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don't think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down
things of importance.Noah T. Clarke's brother got possession of my
little diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written
on the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:

    "You'd scarce expect a volume of my size
    To hold so much that's beautiful and wise,
    And though the heartless world might call me cheap
    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,
    And kindly shelter all who toil below,
    So my future greatness and the good I do
    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon
an old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her
youthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and
on the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for
unexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be
great!"*       *       *       *       *




1880

_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings
of Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go
so far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,
except in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END

particulars with regard to this matter may be found by Your Honours
in the letter from Their Excellencies to Ceylon of May 13, 1692, and
in the letter from His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo of April 29, 1695, which may serve for your guidance.This
may be considered as the fifth favour bestowed on the inhabitants,
but it does not extend to the palmyra planks and laths required by
the Company for the ordinary works in this Commandement or for the
Castle.These are to be paid for at the rate stated in the Trade
Account as paid formerly, because this is a duty they have been
subject to from olden times, and it is unadvisable to depart from
such customs without good reason, the nature of these people being
such that they would not consider it a favour and be grateful for it,
but if they were relieved of this they would continue to complain
of other matters.On the other hand they will, without complaint,
pay such duties as have been long customary, because they consider
themselves born to these.I therefore think it will be best to observe
the old customs.With regard to the purchase of planks and laths on
account of the Company, I found on my arrival from Batavia in this
Commandement that this had been done with the greatest carelessness,
the accounts being in a terrible disorder.I therefore proposed in
my letter of December 9, 1694, to Colombo that such purchases should
be made by the Dessave, as he, by virtue of his office, has the best
opportunity.This was approved of in the letter of the 22nd of the
same month, and since then a certain amount of cash, about Rds.100
or 200, has been handed to him for this purpose, and he accounts for
this money in the Trade Accounts and states how many planks and laths
have been delivered to the Company.In this way it may be always seen
how the account stands, and this practice must be continued.It must
also be seen that as many planks and laths are stored up at the outer
harbours for Coromandel and Trincomalee and at the inner harbours for
Colombo and our own use as will be possible without interfering with
the liberty granted to the inhabitants; because the demand both in
Negapatam and in Colombo is still very great, as may be seen in the
letter of February 10, 1695, to which I have referred.[22]

The felling of timber is a work that must receive particular attention,
as this is required for the repair of the Company's vessels, at
least such parts of them as stand above the water level.For repairs
under water no timber has so far been obtained in the Wanni that is
serviceable, as the timber there is liable to be attacked by a kind of
worm under water.Timber can be transported to the Castle only once
a year during the rainy season, when the rivers swell so much that
the timber which has been felled during the dry season can be brought
down to the Passes and from there to the Fort.Sometimes also timber
is felled near the seashore, when it is brought down along the coast
to Kayts or Hammenhiel by pressed Carrias or fishermen.Occasionally
some timber is also felled near the seacoast between Manaar and
Jaffnapatam, which is suitable for door posts, window frames, and
stocks for muskets and guns, while here also is found the timber for
gun-carriages, which comes in very useful, as the Fort must be well
provided with ammunition.Laurens Pyl for
this Commandement, bearing date November 7, 1679, [36] it is stated
in detail how the felling of timber is conducted and what class of
people are employed in this work.This subject is also dealt with
in the report by the late Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692, so that I
merely refer to these documents, and recommend that another and an
experienced person ought to be trained for the supervision of this work
in addition to the sergeant Harmen Claasz, who has done this work for
the last 25 years, and has gained much experience during his residence
in the forests of the Wanni, and knows exactly when the timber ought
to be felled, when it can be transported, and what kinds of trees are
the most suitable.Because it must be remembered that like all human
beings he also is only mortal.I therefore some time ago appointed the
soldier Laurens Hendriksz as his assistant.He is still employed in
the same capacity.As these forests are very malarious, there are but
few Dutchmen who could live there, and this is the more reason why Your
Honours should always see that an able person is trained to the work,
so as to avoid inconvenience some time or other.It is impossible to
employ a native in this work, because the Wannias would not have the
same regard for a native as for a European, and one of their caprices
to which they are so often subject might interfere with the work.[23]

Charcoal, made from the kernel of the palmyra fruit, is used here
for the smith's forge.In the Memoir referred to Your Honours will
also find stated by whom this is furnished to the Company.As I
noticed that the work in the smith's forge had to be discontinued
sometimes for want of charcoal, especially during the months of
August, September, and October, which causes great inconvenience to
the Government, I proposed to His Excellency the Governor and Council
that a quantity of smiths' coals from Holland should be provided.It must be used in times of scarcity, and the
people who are bound to collect and burn the kernel must be kept
to their duty, and compelled to deliver up the full extent of their
tax.The coals from Holland must be looked upon as a reserve supply,
to be used only when no pannangay kernels are to be had, as happens
sometimes when the inhabitants plant these seeds in order to obtain
from them a kind of root, called calengen, which they use as food.[24]

Bark-lunt is another article which the Company receives from the
inhabitants here without any expense.All inhabitants who go yearly
to the Wanni to sow and mow, consisting of about 6,000 or 7,000
and sometimes even 10,000 persons, and who pay 10 of these lunts to
the Wannias, have on their return at the Passes to pay a piece of
lunt each, 4 fathoms long, and for each cow or bull they have with
them and have employed in the Wanni for ploughing or have allowed
to graze there they also have to pay the same.This amounts to a
considerable quantity yearly, nearly 60,000 lunts.It is a matter
of little importance, but a great convenience, because not only the
garrison in this Commandement is thus furnished, but a large quantity
may also be sent to other places when required, as is done usually to
Negapatam and Trincomalee, for which a charge of 1 stiver a piece is
made, which amount is entered here with the general income and charged
to the said stations.Care must be taken that this duty is paid at
the Redoubts, but on the other hand also that not too much is charged
to these people, because I have heard complaints that sometimes more
than 4 fathoms of the lunt is demanded.This is unfair, because the
surplus is appropriated by persons who have no right to it.[25]

Coral stone, used for building purposes and for the burning of lime,
is found here in abundance.This also the Company obtains without any
expenditure, because it is dug up and broken by ordinary Oeliares.It
is also found at Point Pedro, where it is burnt into lime or otherwise
sent to the Castle in tonys or pontoons, where it is then either burnt
into lime, used for foundations or for the filling up of the body of
walls, which are then covered on the outside with cut coral stone,
as this makes them strong and durable.For some years the cut stone
has also been sent to Negapatam for the fortifications.This must be
continued until we receive notice that it is no longer necessary,
which I think will be soon, because I noticed that lately not so
much stone was asked for.From 1687 up to the present about 52,950
cut stones have been sent to this place.[26]

It may be understood from the above that lime is easily obtained here,
and without great expenditure.That which is required for the Company
here is delivered free of charge.For the lime sent to Negapatam 7
fanams are paid in place of 5 light stivers.[37] This is paid to the
lime burners at Canganture, who received an advance on this account,
of which a small balance is left.Meanwhile the Dessave de Bitter
informed us on his return from Coromandel that no more lime was
required there, but in order that the Company may not lose by the
advance made, a quantity of 8,000 or 9,000 parras of lime is lying
ready at Canganture, which must be fetched by the Company's vessels
in March or April and brought to Kayts.This, I think, will make up
the amount, and if not, they must reimburse the difference.It will
be seen from this that we have tried to comply with the wishes of
His late Excellency van Mydregt, who wrote from Negapatam on July 10,
1687, that the new fortifications there were to be supplied with lime
and all other building materials which are to be found here.The lime
sent there since that date has amounted to 4,751 31/75 lasts.[27]

The dye-root is a product found in this territory which yields the
Company a considerable profit.The best kinds are found in Carrediva,
but the largest quantity in Manaar.The other kinds, found in the
Wanni and The Islands, are so inferior that they cannot be used for
dyeing unless they are mixed with the kinds obtained from Manaar
and Carrediva, and are found in small quantities only.The inferior
kinds are used in this way so that they may not be lost, because it
is to be feared that there will be a greater scarcity of root than
of cloth.I will not enter into detail here as to how, by whom,
where, and when these roots are dug out, or how they are employed
in the dyeing of cloth, or again how much is received yearly; as
all these matters have been mentioned at length on other occasions,
making it unnecessary to do so here.I therefore refer Your Honours
to an account by the late Commandeur Blom, dated April 25, 1693,
with regard to the cultivation and digging of this root, and another
by the same Commandeur of November 12 of the same year with regard to
the dyeing of red cloth and the use of dye-root, while Your Honours
might also look up the document sent to Colombo on December 29, 1694,
by Your Honours and myself, and another of September 16, 1695, where
an estimate is made of the quantity of cloth that could be dyed here
yearly with the root found in this Commandement.An answer will also
be found there to the question raised by the Honourable the Supreme
Government of India in their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695,
as to whether the dye-roots found in Java costing Rds.5 the picol
[38] of 125 lb.and sent here might be employed with profit in the
service of the Company, and whether these roots from Java could not
with advantage be planted here.The reply from Colombo of January
6, 1696, in answer to our letter of September 16, 1695, must also
be considered, in order that Your Honours may bear in mind all the
arguments that have been urged on this subject.Experiments have been
made with the Java roots to see whether they could be turned to any
account, and with a view to compare them with the Jaffna roots.It
seems to me that good results may be obtained from the Brancoedoe
roots, according to the experiments made by myself and afterwards by a
Committee in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies, but as
we cannot be quite sure yet another quantity of Java roots for further
experiments has been sent, as stated in the letter from Batavia of July
3, 1696.Your Honours must pay great attention to these experiments,
so that the result may be definitely known.This was prevented so
far by the rainy season.Besides the above-mentioned documents,
Your Honours will also find useful information on the subject in two
reports submitted by a Committee bearing date July 29 and December
10, 1695.Experiments must also be made to find out whether the
Wancoedoe roots used either alone or mixed with the Jaffna roots will
yield a good red dye of fast colour, this being the wish of Their
Excellencies.Meantime the red cloth ordered in 1694, being 142 webs,
and the 60 webs ordered lately, must be sent as soon as the required
linen arrives from Coromandel.This cloth must be carefully dyed, and
after being examined and approved by the members of Council must be
properly packed by the Pennisten of the Comptoiren who are employed
in this work, on both which points complaints have been received,
and which must be guarded against in future.During my residence
96 webs of cloth have been sent out of the 142 that were ordered,
so that 46 are yet to be sent, besides the 60 of the new order.No
more cloth and dye-roots must be issued to the dyers at a time than
they can use in one dyeing, because otherwise the cloth lies about in
their poor dwellings and gets damaged, while the roots are stolen or
used for private purposes, which is a loss to the Company, of which
many instances might be quoted.There is no doubt the Administrateur
Abraham Mighielsz Biermans, who has been entrusted with the supervision
of this work for many years, will endeavour to further the interests
of the Company in this respect as much as possible and keep these lazy
people to their work.For the present there is a sufficient quantity
of material in stock, as there were in the storehouses on the last
of November, 1696, 60,106 lb.of different kinds of dye-root, with
which a large quantity of cloth may be dyed, while a yearly supply is
delivered at the Fort from Manaar, Carrediva, &c. In Carrediva and "the
Seven Places" as they are called, much less is delivered than formerly,
because at present roots are dug up after the fields have been sown,
while formerly this used to be done before the lands were cultivated,
to the disadvantage of the owners.This practice was abandoned during
the time of Commandeur Blom, as it was considered unfair; because the
fields are already heavily taxed, and on this account the delivery
is 20 to 25 bharen [39] less than before.[28]

The farming out of the various duties in this Commandement may
be considered as the third source of revenue to the Company in
Jaffnapatam, and next to that of the sale of elephants and the revenue
derived from the poll tax, land rents, tithes, Adigary, and Officie
Gelden mentioned before.The farming out of the said duties on the last
of February, 1696, brought to the Company the sum of Rds.27,518 for
the period of one and a half year.The leases were extended on this
occasion with a view to bring them to a close with the close of the
Trade Accounts, which, in compliance with the latest instructions from
Batavia, must be balanced on August 31.The previous year, from March
1 to February 28, 1695-1696, the lease of the said duties amounted
to Rds.15,641, which for 18 months would have been Rds.23,461 1/2,
so that the Company received this year Rds.4,056 1/2 more than last
time; but I believe that the new duty on the import of foreign cloth
has largely contributed to this difference.This was proposed by me
on January 22, 1695, and approved by the Hon.the Supreme Government
of India in their letter of December 12 of the same year.7,100, including the stamping of native cloth with
a seal at 25 per cent., while for the foreign cloth no more than 20
per cent.As Their Excellencies considered this difference
unfair, it has pleased them, at the earnest request of the natives,
or rather at the request of the Majoraals on behalf of the natives, in
a later letter of July 3, 1696, to consent to the native cloth being
taxed at 20 per cent.only, which must be considered in connection
with the new lease.Meantime the order from Batavia contained in
the Resolutions of the Council of India of October 4, 1694, must be
observed, where all farmers are required to pay the monthly terms
of their lease at the beginning of each month in advance.This rule
has been followed here, and it is expressly stipulated in the rent
conditions.Whether the farming out of the duty on native and foreign
cloth will amount to as much or more I cannot say; because I fear
that the present farmer has not made much profit by it, in consequence
of the export having decreased on account of the closing of the free
passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa.The sale of these cloths depends
largely on the import of nely from the said places, and this having
been prevented the sale necessarily decreased and consequently the
farmer made less profit.The passage having been re-opened, however,
it may be expected that the sale will increase again.With a view
to ascertain the exact value of this lease, I sent orders to all
the Passes on February 27, 1696, that a monthly list should be kept
of how many stamped cloths are passed through and by whom, so that
Your Honours will be able to see next August how much cloth has been
exported by examining these lists, while you may also make an estimate
of the quantity of cloth sold here without crossing the Passes, as
the farmer obtains his duty on these.Your Honours may further read
what was reported on this subject from here to Colombo on December 16,
1696, and the reply from Colombo of January 6 of this year.[29]

The Trade Accounts are closed now on August 31, as ordered by the
Supreme Government of India in their letter of May 3, 1695.Last
year's account shows that in this Commandement the Company made a
clear profit of Fl.It might have been greater if more
elephants could have been obtained from the Wanni and Ponneryn, or if
we were allowed the profits on the elephants from Galle and Colombo
sold here on behalf of the Company, which are not accompanied by an
invoice, but only by a simple acknowledgment.Another reason that it
was not higher is that we had to purchase the very expensive grain
from Coromandel.Your Honours must also see that besides observing
this rule of closing the accounts in August, they are submitted to
the Council for examination, in order that it may be seen whether the
discharges are lawful and whether other matters are in agreement with
the instructions, and also whether some items could not be reduced
in future, in compliance with the order passed by Resolution in the
Council of India on September 6, 1694.These and all other orders
sent here during the last two years must be strictly observed, such
as the sending to Batavia of the old muskets, the river navigation
of ships and sloops, the reduction of native weights and measures to
Dutch pounds, the carrying over of the old credits and debits into
the new accounts, the making and use of casks of a given measure,
and the accounting for the new casks of meat, bacon, butter, and
all such orders, which cannot be all mentioned here, but which Your
Honours must look up now and again so as not to forget any and thus
be involved in difficulties.[(30)]

The debts due to the Company at the closing of the accounts must be
entered in a separate memorandum, and submitted with the accounts.In
this memorandum the amount of the debt must be stated, with the name
of the debtor, and whether there is a prospect of the amount being
recovered or not.As shown by Their Excellencies, these outstandings
amounted at the closing of the accounts at the end of February, 1694,
to the sum of Fl.This was reduced on my last departure
to Colombo to Fl.31,948.9.15, as may be seen in the memorandum by the
Administrateur of January 31, 1696.I will now proceed to show that on
my present departure no more is due than the amount of Fl.16,137.8,
in which, however, the rent of the farmers is not included, as it is
only provisional and will be paid up each month, viz.:--


                                                    Fl.The Province of Timmoraten                 376.2.8 [40]
        The Province of Pathelepally               579.10.0
        Panduamoety and Nagachitty               2,448.13.0
        Company's weavers                          167.15.0
        Manuel van Anecotta, Master Dyer         9,823.6.0
        The Caste of the Tannecares              1,650.0.0
        The dyers at Point Pedro and Nalloer       566.14.0
        Don Philip Nellamapane                     375.0.0
        Ambelawanner Wannia                        150.0.0
                                                ===========
                                      Total     16,137.0.8


With regard to the debt of the weavers, amounting to Fl.2,616.8,
I deem it necessary here to mention that the arrears in Timmoratsche
and Patchelepally, spoken of in the memorandum by the Administrateur
of January 31, 1696, compiled by Mr.Bierman on my orders of November
30, 1695, after the closing of the accounts at the end of August,
of which those of Tandia Moety and Naga Chitty and that of the
Company's weavers which refer to the same persons, may, in my opinion,
be considered as irrecoverable.It would therefore be best if Their
Excellencies at Batavia would exempt them from the payment.This debt
dates from the time when it was the intention to induce some weavers
from the opposite coast to come here for the weaving of cloth for the
Company.This caste, called Sinias, [41] received the said amount in
cash, thread, and cotton in advance, and thus were involved in this
large debt, which having been reduced to the amount stated above, has
remained for some years exactly the same, in spite of all endeavours
made to collect it, and notwithstanding that the Paybook-keeper was
appointed to see that the materials were not stolen and the money not
wasted.It has been, however, all in vain, because these people were
so poor that they could not help stealing if they were to live, and it
seems impossible to recover the amount, which was due at first from
200 men, out of whom only 15 or 16 are left now.When they do happen
occasionally to deliver a few gingams, these are so inferior that
the soldiers who receive them at the price of good materials complain
a great deal.I think it unfair that the military should be made to
pay in this way, as the gingams are charged by the Sinias at Fl.6
or 6.10 a piece, while the soldiers have to accept the same at Fl.The same is the case with the Moeris and other cloths which
are delivered by the Sinias, or rather which are obtained from them
with much difficulty; and I have no doubt Your Honours will receive
instructions from Batavia with regard to this matter.Meanwhile they
must be dealt with in the ordinary way; but in case they are exempted
from the payment of their debt I think they ought to be sent out of
the country, not only because they are not liable to taxes or services
to the Company, but also because of the idolatry and devil-worship
which they have to a certain extent been allowed to practise, and
which acts as a poison to the other inhabitants, among whom we have
so long tried to introduce the Dutch Reformed religion.The debt of the dyers at Annecatte, entered under the name of Manoel of
Annecatte, dyer, which amounted at the end of August to Fl.9,823.6,
has been since reduced by Fl.707.10, and is still being reduced
daily, as there is sufficient work at present to keep them all busy,
of which mention has been made under the heading of Dye-roots.This
debt amounted at the end of February, 1694, to Fl.11,920.13.6, so
that since that time one-third has been recovered.This is done by
retaining half the pay for dyeing; for when they deliver red cloth
they only receive half of their pay, and there is thus a prospect
of the whole of this debt being recovered.Care must be taken that
no one gives them any money on interest, which has been prohibited,
because it was found that selfish people, aware of the poverty of
these dyers, sometimes gave them money, not only on interest but at
a usurious rate, so that they lost also half of the pay they received
from the Company on account of those debts, and were kept in continual
poverty, which made them either despondent or too lazy to work.For
this reason an order was issued during the time of the late Commandeur
Blom that such usurers would lose all they had lent to these dyers,
as the Company would not interfere on behalf of the creditors as long
as the debt to the Company was still due.On this account also their
lands have been mortgaged to the Company, and Mr.Blom proposed in
his questions of December 22, 1693, that these should be sold.But
this will not be necessary now, and it would not be advantageous to
the Company if the weavers were thus ruined, while on the other hand
this debt may on the whole be recovered.(31)

The Tannekares are people who made a contract with the Company during
the time of Mr.Blom by a deed bearing date June 7, 1691, in terms
of which they were to deliver two elephants without teeth in lieu
of their poll tax amounting to Fl.269.4.17/60 and for their Oely
service.It was found, however, last August that they were in arrears
for 11 animals, which, calculated at Rds.150 each, brings
their debts to Fl.As all contracts of this
kind for the delivery of elephants are prejudicial to the Company,
I proposed on January 22, 1695, that this contract should be annulled,
stating our reasons for doing so.This proposal was submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia in our letter of August 12 of the same year,
and was approved by them by their letter of December 12, 1695, so that
these people are again in the same position as the other inhabitants,
and will be taxed by the Thombo-keeper for poll tax, land rent, and
Oely service from September 1, 1696.These they must be made to pay,
and they also must be made to pay up the arrears, which they are quite
capable of doing, which matter must be recommended to the attention
of the tax collector in Waddamoraatsche.The debt due by the dyers of Nalloer and Point Pedro, which arose
from their receiving half their pay in advance at their request,
as they were not able to pay their poll tax and land rent (which
amounted to Fl.566.14), has been paid up since.The debt of Don Philip Nellamapane, which amounts to Fl.375, arose
from the amount being lent to him for the purchase of nely in the
latter part of 1694, because there was a complaint that the Wannias,
through a failure of the crop, did not have a sufficient quantity
of grain for the maintenance of the hunters.This money was handed
to Don Gaspar Ilengenarene Mudaliyar, brother-in-law of Don Philip,
and at the request of the latter; so that really, not he, but Don
Gaspar, owes the money.He must be urged to pay up this amount,
which it would be less difficult to do if they were not so much in
arrears with their tribute, because in that case the first animals
they delivered could be taken in payment.There is no doubt, however,
that this debt will be paid if they are urged.The same is the case with the sum of Fl.150 which Ambelewanne Wannia
owes, but as he has to deliver only a few elephants this small amount
can be settled the first time he delivers any elephants above his
tribute.(32)

The Pay Accounts must, like the Trade Accounts, be closed on the
last day of August every year, in compliance with the orders of the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India contained in their letter
of August 13, 1695.They must also be audited and examined, according
to the Resolution passed in the Council of India on September 6,
1694, so that it may be seen whether all the items entered in the
Trade Accounts for payments appear also in the Pay Accounts, while
care must be taken that those who are in arrears at the close of the
books on account of advance received do not receive such payments too
liberally, against which Your Honours will have to guard, so that no
difficulties may arise and the displeasure of Their Excellencies may
not be incurred.Care must also be taken that the various instructions
for the Paybook-keeper are observed, such as those passed by Resolution
of Their Excellencies on August 27 and June 29, 1694, with regard to
the appraising, selling, and entering in the accounts of estates left
by the Company's servants, the rules for the Curators ad lites, those
with regard to the seizure of salaries by private debtors passed by
Resolution of August 5, 1696, in the Council of India, and the rules
passed by Resolution of March 20, with regard to such sums belonging
to the Company's servants as may be found outstanding on interest
after their death, namely, that these must four or six weeks after
be transferred from the Trade Accounts into the Pay Accounts to the
credit of the deceased.(33)

The matter of the Secretariate not being conducted as it ought to
be, cannot be dealt with in full here.It was said in the letters
of November 17 and December 12, 1696, that the new Secretary,
Mr.Bout (who was sent here without any previous intimation to the
Commandeur), would see that all documents were properly registered,
bound, and preserved, but these are the least important duties
of a good Secretary.I cannot omit to recommend here especially
that a journal should be kept, in which all details are entered,
because there are many occurrences with regard to the inhabitants,
the country, the trade, elephants, &c., which it will be impossible to
find when necessary unless they appear in the letters sent to Colombo,
which, however, do not always deal very circumstancially with these
matters.It will be best therefore to keep an accurate journal,
which I found has been neglected for the last three years, surely
much against the intention of the Company.The Secretary must also
see that the Scholarchial resolutions and the notes made on them by
the Political Council are copied and preserved at the Secretariate,
another duty which has not been done for some years.I know on the
other hand that a great deal of the time of the Secretary is taken up
with the keeping of the Treasury Accounts, while there is no Chief
Clerk here to assist him with the Treasury Accounts, or to assist
the Commandeur.Blom, and he proposed
in his letters of February 12 and March 29, 1693, to Colombo that
the Treasury Accounts should be kept by the Paybook-keeper, which,
in my humble opinion, would be the best course, as none of the four
Onderkooplieden [42] here could be better employed for this work
than the Paybook-keeper.It must be remembered, however, that Their
Excellencies do not wish the Regulation of December 29, 1692, to be
altered or transgressed, so that these must be still observed.I would
propose a means by which the duties of the Cashier, and consequently of
the Secretary, could be much decreased, considering that the Cashier
can get no other knowledge of the condition of the general revenue
than from the Thombo-keeper who makes up the accounts, namely, that
the Thombo-keeper should act as General Accountant, as well of the
rent for leases as of the poll tax, land rent, tithes, &c., in which
case the native collectors could give their accounts to him.This,
I expect, would simplify matters, and enable the Secretary to be of
more assistance to the Commandeur.In case such arrangement should be
made, the General Accountant could keep the accounts of the revenue
specified above, which could afterwards be transferred to the accounts
of the Treasury; but Your Honours must wait for the authority to do
so, as I do not wish to take this responsibility.I must recommend
to Your Honours here to see that in future no petitions with regard
to fines are written for the inhabitants except by the Secretaries
of the Political Council or the Court of Justice, as those officers
in India act as Notaries.This has to be done because the petitions
from these rebellious people of Jaffnapatam are so numerous that the
late Mr.Blom had to forbid some of them writing such communications,
because even Toepasses and Mestices take upon themselves to indite
such letters, which pass under the name of petitions, but are often so
full of impertinent and seditious expressions that they more resemble
libels than petitions.Since neither superior nor inferior persons
are spared in these documents, it is often impossible to discover the
author.Whenever the inhabitants have any complaint to make, I think
it will be sufficient if they ask either of the two Secretaries to
draw out a petition for them in which their grievances are stated,
which may be sent to Colombo if the case cannot be decided here.In
this way it will be possible to see that the petitions are written
on stamped paper as ordered by the Company, while they will be
written with the moderation and discrimination that is necessary in
petitions.There are also brought to the Secretariate every year all
sorts of native protocols, such as those kept by the schoolmasters
at the respective churches, deeds, contracts, ola deeds of sale,
and other instruments as may have been circulated among the natives,
which it is not possible to attend to at the Dutch Secretariate.But
as I have been informed that the schoolmasters do not always observe
the Company's orders, and often issue fraudulent instruments and thus
deceive their own countrymen, combining with the Majoraals and the
Chiefs of the Aldeas, by whom a great deal of fraud is committed,
it will be necessary for the Dessave to hold an inquiry and punish
the offenders or deliver them up for punishment.For this purpose
he must read and summarize the instructions with regard to this and
other matters issued successively by Their Excellencies the Governors
of Ceylon and the subaltern Commandeurs of this Commandement, to be
found in the placaats and notices published here relating to this
Commandement.The most important of these rules must be published in
the different churches from time to time, as the people of Jaffnapatam
are much inclined to all kinds of evil practices, which has been
the reason that so many orders and regulations had to be issued by
the placaats, all which laws are the consequence of transgressions
committed.Yet it is very difficult to make these people observe
the rules so long as they find but the least encouragement given to
them by the higher authorities, as stated already.It was decided in
the Meeting of Council of October 20, 1696, that a large number of
old and useless olas which were kept at the Secretariate and were
a great encumbrance should be sorted, and the useless olas burnt
in the presence of a committee, while the Mallabaar and Portuguese
documents concerning the Thombo or description of lands were to be
placed in the custody of the Thombo-keeper.This may be seen in the
report of November 8 of the same year.In this way the Secretariate
has been cleared, and the documents concerning the Thombo put in their
proper place, where they must be kept in future; so that the different
departments may be kept separately with a view to avoid confusion.I
have also noticed on various occasions that the passports of vessels
are lost, either at the Secretariate or elsewhere.Therefore, even so
lately as last December, instructions were sent to Kayts and Point
Pedro to send all such passports here as soon as possible.These
passports, on the departure of the owners, were to be kept at the
Secretariate after renovation by endorsement, unless they were more
than six months old, in which case a new passport was to be issued.In
case Your Honours are not sufficiently acquainted with the form of
these passports and how they are to be signed as introduced by His
late Excellency Governor van Mydregt, you will find the necessary
information in the letters from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of 1687 and
1688 and another from Colombo to Jaffnapatam bearing date April 11,
1690, in which it is stated to what class of persons passports may
be issued.The same rules must be observed in Manaar so far as this
district is concerned, in compliance with the orders contained in
the letter of November 13, 1696.(34)

The Court of Justice has of late lost much of its prestige among the
inhabitants, because, seeing that the Bellale Mudaly Tamby, to whom
previous reference has been made, succeeded on a simple petition sent
to Colombo to escape the Court of Justice while his case was still
undecided (as may be seen from a letter from Colombo of January 6,
1696, and the reply thereto of the 26th of this month), they have an
idea that they cannot be punished here.Even people of the lowest caste
threaten that they will follow the same course whenever they think
they will not gain their object here, especially since they have seen
with what honours Mudaly Tamby was sent back and how the Commissioners
did all he desired, although his own affairs were not even sufficiently
settled yet.A great deal may be stated and proved on this subject, but
as this is not the place to do so, I will only recommend Your Honours
to uphold the Court of Justice in its dignity as much as possible,
and according to the rules and regulations laid down with regard to
it in the Statutes of Batavia and other Instructions.The principal
rule must be that every person receives speedy and prompt justice,
which for various reasons could not be done in the case of Mudaly
Tamby, and the opportunity was given for his being summoned to Colombo.At present the Court of Justice consists of the following persons:--


The Commandeur, President (absent).Dessave de Bitter, Vice-President.van der Bruggen, Administrateur.The Thombo-keeper, Pieter Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos.The Onderkoopman Jan van Groeneveld.But it must be considered that on my departure to Mallabaar, and in
case the Dessave be commissioned to the pearl fishery, this College
will be without a President; the Onderkooplieden Bolscho and Roos
may also be away in the interior for the renovation of the Head
Thombo, and it may also happen that Lieut.Claas Isaacsz will be
appointed Lieutenant-Dessave, in which case he also would have to go
to the interior; in such case there would be only three members left
besides the complainant ex-officio and the Secretary, who would have
no power to pronounce sentence.The Lieutenant van Hovingen and the
Secretary of the Political Council could be appointed for the time,
but in that case the Court would be more a Court Martial than a Court
of Justice, consisting of three Military men and two Civil Servants,
while there would be neither a President nor a Vice-President.I
consider it best, therefore, that the sittings of the Court should
be suspended until the return of the Dessave from the pearl fishery,
unless His Excellency the Governor and the Council should give other
instructions, which Your Honours would be bound to obey.I also found that no law books are kept at the Court, and it would
be well, therefore, if Your Honours applied to His Excellency the
Governor and the Council to provide you with such books as they deem
most useful, because only a minority of the members possess these
books privately, and, as a rule, the Company's servants are poor
lawyers.Justice may therefore be either too severely or too leniently
administered.There are also many native customs according to which
civil matters have to be settled, as the inhabitants would consider
themselves wronged if the European laws be applied to them, and it
would be the cause of disturbances in the country.As, however, a
knowledge of these matters cannot be obtained without careful study and
experience, which not every one will take the trouble to acquire, it
would be well if a concise digest be compiled according to information
supplied by the chiefs and most impartial natives.No one could have a
better opportunity to do this than the Dessave, and such a work might
serve for the instruction of the members of the Court of Justice as
well as for new rulers arriving here, for no one is born with this
knowledge.I am surprised that no one has as yet undertaken this work.Laurens Pyl in his Memoir of November 7, 1679,
with regard to the Court of Justice, namely, that the greatest
precautions must be used in dealing with this false, cunning, and
deceitful race, who think little of taking a false oath when they see
any advantage for themselves in doing so, must be followed.This is
perhaps the reason that the Mudaliyars Don Philip Willewaderayen and
Don Anthony Naryna were ordered in a letter from Colombo of March 22,
1696, to take their oath at the request of the said Mudaly Tamby
only in the heathen fashion, although this seemed out of keeping
with the principles of the Christian religion (Salva Reverentio),
as these people are recognized as baptized Christians, and therefore
the taking of this oath is not practised here.The natives are also
known to be very malicious and contentious among themselves, and do
not hesitate to bring false charges against each other, sometimes for
the sole purpose of being able to say that they gained a triumph over
their opponents before the Court of Justice.They are so obstinate
in their pretended rights that they will revive cases which had been
decided during the time of the Portuguese, and insist on these being
dealt with again.I have been informed that some rules have been laid
down with regard to such cases by other Commandeurs some 6, 8, 10,
and 20 years previous, which it would be well to look up with a view
to restrain these people.They also always revive cases decided by
the Commandeurs or Dessaves whenever these are succeeded by others,
and for this reason I never consented to alter any decision by a former
Commandeur, as the party not satisfied can always appeal to the higher
court at Colombo.His Excellency the Governor and the Council desired
very properly in their letter of November 15, 1694, that no processes
decided civilly by a Commandeur as regent should be brought in appeal
before the Court of Justice here, because the same Commandeur acts in
that College as President.Such cases must therefore be referred to
Colombo, which is the proper course.Care must also be taken that all
documents concerning each case are preserved, registered, and submitted
by the Secretary.I say this because I found that this was shamefully
neglected during my residence here in the years 1691 and 1692, when
several cases had been decided and sentences pronounced, of which not
a single document was preserved, still less the notes or copies made.Another matter to be observed is that contained in the Resolutions
of the Council of India of June 14, 1694, where the amounts paid to
the soldiers and sailors are ordered not to exceed the balance due
to them above what is paid for them monthly in the Fatherland.I
also noticed that at present 6 Lascoreens and 7 Caffirs are paid
as being employed by the Fiscaal, while formerly during the time
of the late Fiscaal Joan de Ridder, who was of the rank of Koopman,
not more than 5 Lascoreens and 6 Caffirs were ever paid for.I do not
know why the number has been increased, and this greater expense is
imposed upon the Company.No more than the former number are to be
employed in future.This number has sufficed for so many years under
the former Fiscaal, and as the Fiscaal has no authority to arrest any
natives without the knowledge of the Commandeur or the Dessave, it
will still suffice.It was during the time of the late Onderkoopman
Lengele, when the word "independent" carried much weight, that the
staff of native servants was increased, although for the service of
the whole College of the Political Council not more than 4 Lascoreens
are employed, although its duties are far more numerous than those of
the Fiscaal.I consider that the number of native servants should be
limited to that strictly necessary, so that it may not be said that
they are kept for show or for private purposes.[35]

The Company has endeavoured at great expense, from the time it took
possession of this Island, to introduce the religion of the True
Reformed Christian Church among this perverse nation.For this purpose
there have been maintained during the last 38 years 35 churches and
3 or 4 clergymen, but how far this has been accepted by the people
of Jaffnapatam I will leave for my successors to judge, rather than
express my opinion on the subject here.It is a well-known fact that
in the year 1693 nearly all the churches in this part of the country
were found stocked with heathen books, besides the catechisms and
Christian prayer books.It is remarkable that this should have
occurred after His late Excellency Governor van Mydregt in 1689
had caused all Roman Catholic churches and secret convents to be
dismantled and abolished, and instead of them founded a Seminary or
Training School for the propagation of the true religion, incurring
great expenses for this purpose.I heard only lately that, while I
was in Colombo and the Dessave in Negapatam, a certain Lascoreen,
with the knowledge of the schoolmasters of the church in Warrany, had
been teaching the children the most wicked fables one could think of,
and that these schoolmasters had been summoned before the Court of
Justice here and caned and the books burnt.But on my return I found
to my surprise that these schoolmasters had not been dismissed, and
that neither at the Political Council nor at the Court of Justice
had any notes been made of this occurrence, and still less a record
made as to how the case had been decided.The masters were therefore
on my orders summoned again before the meeting of the Scholarchen,
by which they were suspended until such time as the Lascoreen should
be arrested.I have not succeeded in laying hands on this Lascoreen,
but Your Honours must make every endeavour, after my departure, to
trace him out; because he may perhaps imagine that the matter has
been forgotten.Such occurrences as these are not new in Warrany;
because the idolatry committed there in 1679 will be known to some
of you.On that occasion the authors were arrested by the Company
through the assistance of the Brahmin Timmersa Nayk, notwithstanding he
himself was a heathen, as may be seen from the public acknowledgment
granted to him by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, November 7, 1679.I
therefore think that the Wannias are at the bottom of all this
idolatry, not only because they have alliances with the Bellales all
over the country, but especially because their adherents are to be
found in Warrany and also in the whole Province of Patchelepalle,
where half the inhabitants are dependent on them.This was seen at
the time the Wannias marched about here in Jaffnapatam in triumph,
and almost posed as rulers here.We may be assured that they are
the greatest devil-worshippers that could be found, for they have
never yet admitted a European into their houses, for fear of their
idolatry being discovered, while for the sake of appearance they
allow themselves to be married and baptized by our ministers.For instance, it is a well-known fact that Don Philip Nellamapane
applied to His late Excellency van Mydregt that one of his sons might
be admitted into the Seminary, with a view of getting into his good
graces; while no sooner had His Excellency left this than the son
was recalled under some false pretext.In 1696, when this boy was in
Negapatam with the Dessave de Bitter, he was caught making offerings
in the temples, wearing disguise at the time.It could not be expected
that such a boy, of no more than ten or twelve years old, should do
this if he had not been taught or ordered by his parents to do so
or had seen them doing the same, especially as he was being taught
another religion in the Seminary.I could relate many such instances,
but as this is not the place to do so, this may serve as an example
to put you on your guard.It is only known to God, who searches the
hearts and minds of men, what the reason is that our religion is not
more readily accepted by this nation: whether it is because the time
for their conversion has not yet arrived, or whether for any other
reason, I will leave to the Omniscient Lord.You might read what has
been written by His Excellency van Mydregt in his proposal to the
reverend brethren the clergy and the Consistory here on January 11,
1690, with regard to the promotion of religion and the building of
a Seminary.I could refer to many other documents bearing on this
subject, but I will only quote here the lessons contained in the
Instructions of the late Commandeur Paviljoen of December 19, 1665,
where he urges that the reverend brethren the clergy must be upheld and
supported by the Political Council in the performance of their august
duties, and that they must be provided with all necessary comforts;
so that they may not lose their zeal, but may carry out their work
with pleasure and diligence.On the other hand care must be taken
that no infringement of the jurisdiction of the Political Council
takes place, and on this subject it would be well for Your Honours
to read the last letter from Batavia of July 3,1696, with regard to
the words Sjuttan Peria Padrie and other such matters concerning the
Political Council as well as the clergy.(36)

With regard to the Seminary or training school for native children
founded in the year 1690 by His late Excellency van Mydregt, as another
evidence of the anxiety of the Company to propagate the True and Holy
Gospel among this blind nation for the salvation of their souls,
I will state here chiefly that Your Honours may follow the rules
and regulations compiled by His Excellency, as also those sent to
Jaffnapatam on the 16th of the same month.Twice a year the pupils
must be examined in the presence of the Scholarchen (those of the
Seminary as well as of the other churches) and of the clergy and the
rector.In this college the Commandeur is to act as President, but, as
I am to depart to Mallabaar, this office must be filled by the Dessave,
in compliance with the orders contained in the letters from Colombo
of April 4, 1696.The reports of these examinations must be entered
in the minute book kept by the Scriba, Jan de Crouse.These minutes
must be signed by the President and the other curators, while Your
Honours will be able to give further instructions and directions as
to how they are to be kept.During my absence the examination must be
held in the presence of the Dessave, and the Administrateur Michiels
Biermans and the Thombo-keeper Pieter Bolscho as Scholarchen of the
Seminary, the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and the Onderkoopman Joan Roos
as Scholarchen of the native churches, the reverend Adrianus Henricus
de Mey, acting Rector, and three other clergymen.It must be remembered, however, that this is only with regard to
examinations and not with regard to the framing of resolutions, which
so far has been left to the two Scholarchen and the President of the
Seminary.These, as special curators and directors, have received
higher authority from His Excellency the Governor and the Council,
with the understanding, however, that they observe the rules given
by His Excellency and the Council both with regard to the rector and
the children, in their letters of April 4 and June 13, 1696, and the
Resolutions framed by the curators of June 27 and October 21, 1695,
which were approved in Colombo.Whereas the school had been so far
maintained out of a fund set apart for this purpose, in compliance
with the orders of His Excellency, special accounts being kept of
the expenditure, it has now pleased the Council of India to decide
by Resolution of October 4, 1694, that only the cost of erection
of this magnificent building, which amounted to Rds.5,274, should
be paid out of the said fund.This debt having been paid, orders
were received in a letter from Their Excellencies of June 3, 1696,
that the institution is to be maintained out of the Company's funds,
special accounts of the expenditure being kept and sent yearly, both
to the Fatherland and to Batavia.At the closing of the accounts
last August the accounts of the Seminary as well as the amount due
to it were transferred to the Company's accounts.17,141, made up as follows:--


    Rds.10,341 entered at the Chief Counting-house in Colombo.1,200 cash paid by the Treasurer of the Seminary into the
                Company's Treasury, December 1, 1696.The latter was on December 1, 1690, on the foundation of the Seminary,
granted to that institution, and must now again, as before, be
placed by the Cashier on interest and a special account kept thereof;
because out of this fund the repairs to the churches and schools and
the expenses incurred in the visits of the clergy and the Scholarchen
have to be paid.Other items of revenue which had been appropriated
for the foundation of the Seminary, such as the farming out of
the fishery, &c., must be entered again in the Company's accounts,
as well as the revenue derived from the sale of lands, and that of
the two elephants allowed yearly to the Seminary.The fines levied
occasionally by the Dessave on the natives for offences committed
must be entered in the accounts of the Deaconate or of that of the
church fines, for whichever purpose they are most required.The Sicos [43] money must again be expended in the fortifications,
as it used to be done before the building of the Training School.The
income of the Seminary consisted of these six items, besides the
interest paid on the capital.This, I think, is all I need say on
the subject for Your Honours' information.I will only add that I
hope and pray that the Lord may more and more bless this Christian
design and the religious zeal of the Company.(37)

The Scholarchen Commission is a college of civil and ecclesiastical
officers, which for good reasons was introduced into this part of
the country from the very beginning of our rule.Their meetings are
usually held on the first Tuesday of every month, and at these is
decided what is necessary to be done for the advantage of the church,
such as the discharge and appointment of schoolmasters and merinhos,
[44] &c. It is here also that the periodical visits of the brethren of
the clergy to the different parishes are arranged.The applications of
natives who wish to enter into matrimony are also addressed to this
college.All the decisions are entered monthly in the resolutions,
which are submitted to the Political Council.This is done as I had
an idea that things were not as they ought to be with regard to the
visitation of churches and inspection of schools, and that the rules
made to that effect had come to be disregarded.This was a bad example,
and it may be seen from the Scholarchial Resolution Book of 1695 and
of the beginning of 1696, what difficulty I had in reintroducing these
rules.I succeeded at last so far in this matter that the visits of
the brethren of the clergy were properly divided and the time for them
appointed.This may be seen from the replies of the Political Council
to the Scholarchial Resolutions of January 14 and February 2, 1696.On my return from Ceylon I found inserted in the Scholarchial
Resolution Book a petition from two of the clergymen which had been
clandestinely sent to Colombo, in which they did not hesitate to
complain of the orders issued with regard to the visits referred to,
and, although these orders had been approved by His Excellency the
Governor and the Council, as stated above, the request made in this
clandestine petition was granted on March 6, 1696, and the petition
returned to Jaffnapatam with a letter signed on behalf of the Company
on March 14 following.It is true I also found an order from Colombo,
bearing date April 4 following, to the effect that no petitions should
be sent in future except through the Government here, which is in
accordance with the rules observed all over India, but the letter
from Colombo of November 17, received here, and the letter sent from
here to Colombo on December 12, prove that the rule was disregarded
almost as soon as it was made.On this account I could not reply
to the resolutions of the Scholarchen, as the petition, contrary to
those rules, was inserted among them.I think that the respect due
to a ruler in the service of the Company should not be sacrificed to
the private opposition of persons who consider that the orders issued
are to their disadvantage, and who rely on the success of private
petitions sent clandestinely which are publicly granted.In order not
to expose myself to such an indignity for the second time I left the
resolutions unanswered, and it will be necessary for Your Honours to
call a meeting of the Political Council to consider these resolutions,
to prevent the work among the natives being neglected.The College
of the Scholarchen consists at present of the following persons:--


The Dessave de Bitter, President.The Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, Scholarch.The Onderkoopman P. Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos, Scholarch.Adrianus Henricus de Mey, Clergyman.Philippus de Vriest, Clergyman.Thomas van Symey, Clergyman.I am obliged to mention here also for Your Honours' information that I
have noticed that the brethren of the clergy, after having succeeded
by means of their petition to get the visits arranged according to
their wish, usually apply for assistance, such as attendants, coolies,
cayoppen, &c., as soon as the time for their visits arrive, that is to
say, when it is their turn to go to such places as have the reputation
of furnishing good mutton, fowls, butter, &c.; but when they have to
visit the poorer districts, such as Patchelepalle, the boundaries of
the Wanny, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, they seldom give notice of the
arrival of the time, and some even go to the length of refusing to go
until they are commanded to depart.From this an idea may be formed of
the nature of their love for the work of propagating religion.Some
also take their wives with them on their visits of inspection to
the churches and schools, which is certainly not right as regards
the natives, because they have to bear the expense.With regard to
the regulations concerning the churches and schools, I think these
are so well known to Your Honours that it would be superfluous for
me to quote any documents here.I will therefore only recommend the
strict observation of all these rules, and also of those made by His
Excellency Mr.van Mydregt of November 29, 1690, and those of Mr.Blom
of October 20, with regard to the visits of the clergy to the churches
and the instructions for the Scholarchen in Ceylon generally by His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of December 25, 1663, and
approved by the Council of India with a few alterations in March, 1667.The Consistory consists at present of the four ministers mentioned
above, besides:--


Joan Roos, Elder.To these is added as Commissaris Politicus, the Administrateur Abraham
Michielsz Biermans, in compliance with the orders of December 27, 1643,
issued by His late Excellency the Governor General Antony van Diemen
and the Council of India at Batavia.Further information relating
to the churches may be found in the resolutions of the Political
Council and the College of the Scholarchen of Ceylon from March 13,
1668, to April 3 following.I think that in these documents will be
found all measures calculated to advance the prosperity of the church
in Jaffnapatam, and to these may be added the instructions for the
clergy passed at the meeting of January 11, 1651.(38)

The churches and the buildings attached to the churches are in many
places greatly decayed.I found to my regret that some churches
look more like stables than buildings where the Word of God is to be
propagated among the Mallabaars.It is evident that for some years
very little has been done in regard to this matter, and as this is a
work particularly within the province of the Dessave, I have no doubt
that he will take the necessary measures to remedy the evil; so that
the natives may not be led to think that even their rulers do not have
much esteem for the True Religion.It would be well for the Dessave
to go on circuit and himself inspect all the churches.Until he can
do so he may be guided by the reports with regard to these buildings
made by Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz on March 19 and April 4, 1696.He
must also be aware that the schoolmasters and merinhos have neglected
the gardens attached to the houses, which contain many fruit trees and
formerly yielded very good fruit, especially grapes, which served for
the refreshment of the clergymen and Scholarchen on their visits.(39)

The Civil Court or Land Raad has been instituted on account of the
large population, and because of the difficulty of settling their
disagreements, which cannot always be done by the Commandeur or the
Court of Justice, nor by the Dessave, because his jurisdiction is
limited to the amount of 100 Pordaus.[45] The sessions held every
Wednesday must not be omitted again, as happened during my absence
in Colombo on account of the indisposition of the President.This
Court consists at present of the following persons:--


Abraham Michielsz Biermans, Administrateur.Jan Fransz, Vryburger, Vice-President.Jan Lodewyk Stumphuis, Paymaster.Lucas de Lange, Vryburger.Louis Verwyk, Vryburger.J. L. Stumphuis, mentioned above, Secretary.The native members are Don Louis Poeder and Don Denis Nitsingeraye.The instructions issued for the guidance of the Land Raad may be found
with the documents relating to this college of 1661, in which are also
contained the various Ordinances relating to the official Secretaries
in this Commandement, all which must be strictly observed.As there is
no proper place for the assembly of the Land Raad nor for the meeting
of the Scholarchen, and as both have been held so far in the front room
of the house of the Dessave, where there is no privacy for either,
it will be necessary to make proper provision for this.The best
place would be in the town behind the orphanage, where the Company
has a large plot of land and could acquire still more if a certain
foul pool be filled up as ordered by His Excellency van Mydregt.A
building ought to be put up about 80 or 84 feet by 30 feet, with a
gallery in the centre of about 10 or 12 feet, so that two large rooms
could be obtained, one on either side of the gallery, the one for the
assembly of the Land Raad and the other for that of the Scholarchen.It
would be best to have the whole of the ground raised about 5 or 6
feet to keep it as dry as possible during the rainy season, while
at the entrance, in front of the gallery, a flight of stone steps
would be required.In order, however, that it may not seem as if I am
unaware of the order contained in the letter from Their Excellencies
of November 23, 1695, where the erection of no public building is
permitted without authority from Batavia, except at the private cost
of the builder, I wish to state here particularly that I have merely
stated the above by way of advice, and that Your Honours must wait for
orders from Batavia for the erection of such a building.I imagine
that Their Excellencies will give their consent when they consider
that masonry work costs the Company but very little in Jaffnapatam,
as may be seen in the expenditure on the fortifications, which was
met entirely by the chicos or fines, imposed on those who failed to
attend for the Oely service.Lime, stone, cooly labour, and timber
are obtained free, except palmyra rafters, which, however, are not
expensive.The chief cost consists in the wages for masonry work and
the iron, so that in respect of building Jaffnapatam has an advantage
over other places.Further instructions must however be awaited, as
none of the Company's servants is authorized to dispense with them.(40)

The Weesmeesteren (guardians of the orphans) will find the regulations
for their guidance in the Statutes of Batavia, which were published
on July 1, 1642, [46] by His Excellency the Governor-General Antonis
van Diemen and the Council of India by public placaat.This college
consists at present of the following persons:--


Pieter Chr.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.Johannes Huysman, Boekhouder.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger.the Government of India has been pleased to send
to Ceylon by letter of May 3, 1695, a special Ordinance for the
Orphan Chamber and its officials with regard to their salaries,
I consider it necessary to remind you of it here and to recommend
its strict observance, as well also of the resolution of March 20,
1696, whereby the Orphan Chamber is instructed that all such money
as is placed under their administration which is derived from the
estates of deceased persons who had invested money on interest with
the Company, and whose heirs were not living in the same place, must
be remitted to the Orphan Chamber at Batavia with the interest due
within a month or six weeks.(41)

The Commissioners of Marriage Causes will also find their instructions
in the Statutes of Batavia, mentioned above, which must be carefully
observed.Nothing need be said with regard to this College, but that
it consists of the following persons:--


Claas Isaacsz, Lieutenant, President.Lucas Langer, Vryburger, Vice-President.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.[42]


The officers of the Burgery, [47] the Pennisten, [48] and the
Ambachtsgezellen [49] will likewise find their instructions and
regulations in the Statutes of Batavia, and apply them as far as
applicable.[43]

The Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and the Wardens of the Town
(Brand and Wyk Meesteren) have their orders and distribution of work
publicly assigned to them by the Regulation of November 8, 1691,
upon which I need not remark anything, except that the following
persons are the present members of this body:--


Jan van Croenevelt, Fiscaal, President.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger, Vice-President.Lucas de Langer, Vryburger.[44]


The deacons, as caretakers of the poor, have been mentioned already
under the heading of the Consistory.During the last five and half
years they have spent Rds.1,145.3.7 more than they received.As I
apprehended this would cause inconvenience, I proposed in my letter
of December 1, 1696, to Colombo that the Poor House should be endowed
with the Sicos money for the year 1695, which otherwise would have
been granted to the Seminary, which did not need it then, as it had
received more than it required.Meantime orders were received from
Batavia that the funds of the said Seminary should be transferred
to the Company, so that the Sicos money could not be disposed of in
that way.As the deficit is chiefly due to the purchase, alteration,
and repairing of an orphanage and the maintenance of the children,
as may be seen from the letters to Colombo of December 12 and 17,
1696, to which expenditure the Deaconate had not been subject before
the year 1690, other means will have to be considered to increase
its funds in order to prevent the Deaconate from getting into further
arrears.It would be well therefore if Your Honours would carefully
read the Instructions of His late Excellency van Mydregt of November
29, 1690, and ascertain whether alimentation given to the poor by
the Deaconate has been well distributed and whether it really was of
the nature of alms and alimentation as it should be.A report of the
result of your inquiry should be sent to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council of Colombo.You might also state therein whether the
orphanage has not been sufficiently enlarged yet, for it seems to me
that the expenditure is too great for only 14 children, as there are
at present.It might also be considered whether the Company could not
find some source of income for the Deaconate in case this orphanage
is not quite completed without further expenditure, and care must be
taken that the deacons strictly observe the rules laid down for them
in the Regulation of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Ceylon of January 2, 1666.The present matron, Catharina Cornelisz,
widow of the late Krankbezoeker Dupree, must be directed to follow
the rules laid down for her by the Governor here on November 4, 1694,
and approved in Colombo.That all the inferior colleges mentioned
here successively have to be renewed yearly by the Political Council
is such a well-known matter that I do not think it would escape
your attention; but, as approbation from Colombo has to be obtained
for the changes made they have to be considered early, so that the
approbation may be received here in time.The usual date is June 23,
the day of the conquest of this territory, but this date has been
altered again to June 13, 1696, by His Excellency the Governor and
the Council of Colombo.[45]

The assessment of all measures and weights must likewise be renewed
every year, in the presence of the Fiscaal and Commissioners;
because the deceitful nature of these inhabitants is so great that
they seem not to be able to help cheating each other.The proceeds
of this marking, which usually amounts to Rds.70 or 80, are for the
largest part given to some deserving person as a subsistence.On my
arrival here I found that it had been granted to the Vryburger Jurrian
Verwyk, who is an old man and almost unable to serve as an assayer.The
post has, however, been left to him, and his son-in-law Jan Fransz,
also a Vryburger, has been appointed his assistant.The last time
the proceeds amounted to 80 rds.3 fannums, 8 tammekassen and 2 1/2
duyten, as may be seen from the report of the Commissioners bearing
date December 13, 1696.This amount has been disposed of as follows:--


        For the Assizer                      Rds.60.0.0.0
        For the assistant to the Assizer      "    6.0.0.0
        Balance to the Company's account      "   14.3.8.2 1/2
                                                  ============
                                    Total    Rds.80.3.8.2 1/2


It must be seen to that the Assizer, having been sworn, observes
his instructions as extracted from the Statutes of Batavia, as made
applicable to the customs of this country by the Government here on
March 3, 1666.In compliance with orders from Batavia contained in the letter of June
24, 1696, sums on interest may not be deposited with the Company here,
as may be seen also from a letter sent from here to Batavia on August
18 following, where it is stated that all money deposited thus must
be refunded.This order has been carried out, and the only deposits
retained are those of the Orphan Chamber, the Deaconate, the Seminary,
and the Widows' fund, for which permission had been obtained by letter
of December 15 of the same year.As the Seminary no longer possesses
any fund of its own, no deposit on that account is now left with
the Company.Your Honours must see that no other sums on interest
are accepted in deposit, as this Commandement has more money than
is necessary for its expenditure and even to assist other stations,
such as Trincomalee, &c., for which yearly Rds.16,000 to 18,000
are required, and this notwithstanding that Coromandel receives the
proceeds from the sale of elephants here, while we receive only the
money drafts.[46]

No money drafts are to be passed here on behalf of private persons,
whether Company's servants or otherwise, in any of the outstations,
but in case any person wishes to remit money to Batavia, this may be
done only after permission and consent obtained from His Excellency
the Governor at Colombo.When this is obtained, the draft is prepared
at Colombo and only signed here by the Treasurer on receipt of the
amount.This is specially mentioned here in order that Your Honours may
also remember in such cases the Instructions sent by the Honourable the
Government of India in the letters of May 3, 1695, and June 3, 1696,
in the former of which it is stated that no copper coin, and in the
latter that Pagodas are to be received here on behalf of the Company
for such drafts, each Pagoda being counted at Rds.[47]

The golden Pagoda is a coin which was never or seldom known to be
forged, at least so long as the King of Golconda or the King of the
Carnatic was sovereign in Coromandel.But the present war, which has
raged for the last ten years in that country, seems to have taken away
to some extent the fear of evil and the disgrace which follows it,
and to have given opportunity to some to employ cunning in the pursuit
of gain.It has thus happened that on the coast beyond Porto Novo,
in the domain of these lords of the woods (Boschheeren) or Paligares,
Pagodas have been made which, although not forged, are yet inferior
in quality; while the King of Sinsi Rama Ragie is so much occupied
with the present war against the Mogul, that he has no time to pay
attention to the doings of these Paligares.According to a statement
made by His Excellency the Governor Laurens Pyl and the Council of
Negapatam in their letter of November 4, 1695, five different kinds
of such inferior Pagodas have been received, valued at 7 3/8, 7 1/8,
7 5/8, 7 7/8, and 8 3/4 of unwrought gold.A notice was published
therefore on November 18, following, to warn the people against the
acceptance of such Pagodas, and prohibiting their introduction into
this country.When the Company's Treasury was verified by a Committee,
1,042 of these Pagodas were found.Intimation was sent to Colombo on
December 31, 1695.The Treasurer informed me when I was in Colombo
that he had sent them to Trincomalee, and as no complaints have been
received, it seems that the Sinhalese in that quarter did not know
how to distinguish them from the current Pagodas.As I heard that
the inferior Pagodas had been already introduced here, while it was
impossible to get rid of them, as many of the people of Jaffnapatam
and the merchants made a profit on them by obtaining them at a lower
rate in Coromandel and passing them here to ignorant people at the
full value, a banker from Negapatam able to distinguish the good from
the inferior coins has been asked to test all Pagodas, so that the
Company may not suffer a loss.But in spite of this I receive daily
complaints from Company's servants, including soldiers and sailors,
that they always have to suffer loss on the Pagodas received from
the Company in payment of their wages, when they present them at the
bazaar; while the chetties and bankers will never give them 24 fanums
for a Pagoda.This matter looks very suspicious, and may have an evil
influence on the Company's servants, because it is possible that the
chetties have agreed among themselves never to pay the full value
for Pagodas, whether they are good or bad.It is also possible that
the Company's cashier or banker is in collusion with the chetties,
or perhaps there is some reason for this which I am not able to
make out.However this may be, Your Honours must try to obtain as
much information as possible on this subject and report on it to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.All inferior
Pagodas found in the Company's Treasury will have to be made good by
the cashier at Coromandel, as it was his business to see that none
were accepted.With a view to prevent discontent among the Company's
servants the tax collectors must be made to pay only in copper and
silver coin for the poll tax and land rent, and out of this the
soldiers, sailors, and the lower grades of officials must be paid,
as I had already arranged before I left.I think that they can easily
do this, as they have to collect the amount in small instalments from
all classes of persons.The poor people do not pay in Pagodas, and the
collectors might make a profit by changing the small coin for Pagodas,
and this order will be a safeguard against loss both to the Company
and its servants.It would be well if Your Honours could find a means
of preventing the Pagodas being introduced and to discard those that
are in circulation already, which I have so far not been able to
do.Perhaps on some occasion you might find a suitable means.[48]

The demands received here from out-stations in this Commandement must
be met as far as possible, because it is a rule with the Company that
one district must accommodate another, which, I suppose, will be
the practice everywhere.Since His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo have authorized Your Honours in their letter of
June 13,1696, to draw directly from Coromandel the goods required from
those places for the use of this Commandement, Your Honours must avail
yourselves of this kind permission, which is in agreement with the
intention of the late Commissioner van Mydregt, who did not wish that
the order should pass through various hands.Care must be taken to send
the orders in due time, so that the supplies may not run out of stock
when required for the garrisons.The articles ordered from Jaffnapatam
for Manaar must be sent only in instalments, and no articles must be
sent but those that are really required, as instructed; because it
has occurred more than once that goods were ordered which remained
in the warehouses, because they could not be sold, and which, when
going bad, had to be returned here and sold by public auction, to
the prejudice of the Company.To give an idea of the small sale in
Manaar, I will just state here that last year various provisions and
other articles from the Company's warehouses were sent to the amount
of Fl.1,261.16.6--cost price--which were sold there at Fl.2,037,
so that only a profit of Fl.775.3.10 was made, which did not include
any merchandise, but only articles for consumption and use.[49]

The Company's chaloups [50] and other vessels kept here for the
service of the Company are the following:--


            The chaloup "Kennemerland.""'t Wapen van Friesland."The small chaloup "Manaar."Further, 14 tonys [51] and manschouwers, [52] viz.:--


            4 tonys for service in the Fort.1 tony  in Isle de Vacoa.in the islands "De Twee Gebroeders."Three manschouwers for the three largest chaloups, one manschouwer for
the ponton "De Hoop," one manschouwer for the ferry at Colombogamme,
one manschouwer for the ferry between the island Leiden and the fort
Kayts or Hammenhiel.The chaloups "Kennemerland" and "Friesland" are used mostly for the
passage between Coromandel and Jaffnapatam, and to and fro between
Jaffnapatam and Manaar, because they sink too deep to pass the river
of Manaar to be used on the west coast of Ceylon between Colombo and
Manaar.They are therefore employed during the northern monsoon to
fetch from Manaar such articles as have been brought there from Colombo
for this Commandement, and also to transport such things as are to
be sent from here to Colombo and Manaar, &c. They also serve during
the southern monsoon to bring here from Negapatam nely, cotton goods,
coast iron, &c., and they take back palmyra wood, laths, jagerbollen,
[53] coral stone, also palmyra wood for Trincomalee, and corsingos,
oil, cayro, [54] &c. The sloop "Jaffnapatam" has been built more
for convenience, and conveys usually important advices and money, as
also the Company's servants.As this vessel can be made to navigate
the Manaar river, it is also used as a cruiser at the pearl banks,
during the pearl fishery.It is employed between Colombo, Manaar,
Jaffnapatam, Negapatam, and Trincomalee, wherever required.The small
sloops "Manaar" and "De Visser," which are so small that they might
sooner be called boats than sloops, are on account of their small
size usually employed between Manaar and Jaffnapatam, and also for
inland navigation between the Passes and Kayts for the transport of
soldiers, money, dye-roots from The Islands, timber from the borders
of the Wanni, horses from The Islands; while they are also useful
for the conveyance of urgent advices and may be used also during the
pearl fishery.The sloop "Hammenhiel," being still smaller than the
two former, is only used for convenience of the garrison at Kayts,
the fort being surrounded by water.This and a tony are used to
bring the people across, and also to fetch drinking water and fuel
from the "Barren Island."The three pontons are very useful here,
as they have daily to bring fuel and lime for this Castle, and they
are also used for the unloading of the sloops at Kayts, where they
bring charcoal and caddegans, [55] and fetch lunt from the Passes,
and palmyra wood from the inner harbours for this place as well
as for Manaar and Colombo.They also bring coral stone from Kayts,
and have to transport the nely and other provisions to the redoubts
on the borders of the Wanni, so that they need never be unemployed
if there is only a sufficient number of carreas or fishermen for the
crew.At present there are 72 carreas who have to perform oely service
on board of these vessels or on the four tonies mentioned above.(50)

In order that these vessels may be preserved for many years, it
is necessary that they be keelhauled at least twice a year, and
rubbed with lime and margosa oil to prevent worms from attacking
them, which may be easily done by taking them all in turn.It must
also be remembered to apply to His Excellency the Governor and the
Council for a sufficient quantity of pitch, tar, sail cloth, paint,
and linseed oil, because I have no doubt that it will be an advantage
to the Company if the said vessels are kept constantly in repair.As
stated under the heading of the felling of timber, no suitable wood
is found in the Wanni for the parts of the vessels that remain under
water, and therefore no less than 150 or 200 kiate or angely boards of
2 1/2, 2, and 1 1/2 inches thickness are required yearly here for this
purpose.His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo have
promised to send this yearly, in answer to the request from Jaffnapatam
of February 17, 1692, and since this timber has to be obtained from
Mallabaar I will see whether I cannot send it directly by a private
vessel in case it cannot be obtained from Colombo.Application must be
made for Dutch sailors from Colombo to man the said sloops, which are
at present partly manned by natives for want of Europeans.According to
the latest regulation, 95 sailors are allowed for this Commandement,
while at present we have not even half that number, as only 46 are
employed, which causes much inconvenience in the service.The fortifications of the Castle have now for a few years been
complete, except the moat, which is being dug and has advanced to the
peculiar stratum of rocks which is found only in this country.All
matters relating to this subject are to be found in the Compendiums
for 1693, 1694, and 1695.Supposing that the moat could be dug to the
proper depth without danger to the fort, it could not be done in less
than a few years, and it cannot very well be accomplished with the
services of the ordinary oeliaars, so that other means will have to be
considered.If, on the other hand, the moat cannot be deepened without
danger to the foundations of the fort, as stated in the Compendium
for 1694, it is apparent that the project ought to be abandoned.In
that case the fort must be secured in some other way.The most natural
means which suggests itself is to raise the wall on all sides except
on the river side by 6 or 8 feet, but this is not quite possible,
because the foundation under the curtains of the fortification, the
faces of the bastion, and the flanks have been built too narrow,
so that only a parapet of about 11 feet is left, which is already
too small, while if the parapet were extended inward there would not
be sufficient space for the canons and the military.The best plan
would therefore be to cut away the hills that are found between the
Castle and the town.The earth might be thrown into the tank found
eastward of the Castle, while part of it might be utilized to fill
up another tank in the town behind the orphanage.This was the plan
of His Excellency van Mydregt, although it was never put down in
writing.Meantime care must be taken that the slaves and other native
servants of persons residing in the Castle do not through laziness
throw the dirt which they are supposed to carry away from the fort on
the opposite bank of the moat, and thus raise a space which the Company
would much rather lower, and gradually and imperceptibly prepare a
suitable place for the battery of an enemy.I have had notices put
up against this practice, under date July 18, 1695, and these must be
maintained and the offenders prosecuted.Considering the situation of
the Castle and the present appearance of the moat, I think that the
latter is already sufficiently deep if always four or five feet water
be kept in it.In order to do this two banks would have to be built,
as the moat has communication in two places with the river, while the
river also touches the fort at two points.This being done I think
the moat could be kept full of water by two or three water mills
driven by wind and pumps, especially during the south-west monsoon
or the dry season, when an attack would be most likely to occur,
and there is always plenty of wind to keep these mills going both
by night and day.A sluice would be required in the middle of these
banks so that the water may be let out whenever it became offensive
by the river running dry, to be filled again when the water rose.It
would have to be first ascertained whether the banks could really
be built in such a way that they would entirely stop the water in
the moat, because they would have to be built on one side against
the foundations of the fort, which I have been told consist of large
irregular rocks.An experiment could be made with a small mill of the
kind used in Holland in the ditches along bleaching fields.They are
quite inexpensive and easily erected and not difficult to repair,
as they turn on a dovetail.The late Commandeur Anthony Paviljoen
also appears to have thought of this plan even before this Castle was
built, when the Portuguese fort was occupied by the Company, as may
be seen from his instructions of December 19, 1665.[56] This would,
in my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,
while during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that
neither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while
moreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These
three plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by
a wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the
water, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong
to serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to
its proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one
is as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable
and carpenters' yard, which are on the south side just outside the
opposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for
the reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I
was however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of
December 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter
of July 3 following.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,
although it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;
because Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable
were within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.It is true
that the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen
from the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,
and April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to
this matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,
[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his
wish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with
regard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must
be followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible
without danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and
banks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,
I think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between
the rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar
Oldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of
their resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would
form a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp
that they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,
all soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these
thorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher
than 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite
a tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found
on my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already
been erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be
completed as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this
purpose arrives.In the carpenters' yard some timber will be found that
was prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,
perhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This
work will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous
for anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will
also be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The
bridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and
the opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden
railing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by
the application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this
country unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed
oil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter
to Your Honours.[51]

The fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank
upon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the
beginning of December during the north-east monsoon.The damage must
be remedied with stones.In this fortress a reservoir paved with
Dutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,
but it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets
and may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in
my letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it
will have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can
be made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been
roofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been
laid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing
of provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are
liable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,
so that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of
the floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom
a beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,
which is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still
covered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]

Ponneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only
require a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of
Hammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February
17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo
promised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the
Fatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is
not so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good
drink water.[53]

The work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening
of the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are
completed.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the
Company's slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are
also several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,
so that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During
my circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council
at Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral
stone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes
away the Company's sloops from their usual employment, and the
officials have been informed that they must get the lime made
from the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of
Condaatje as remains of the fishery.It makes very good lime, and
the forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can
then be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this
subject may be found in the correspondence between this station and
Jaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells
is used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in
the fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the
galleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers
who up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into
it, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should
reside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company's
rules with regard to military stations in India.(54)

Provisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration
if we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,
for the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the
officials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two
things ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency
van Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station
should be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in
the letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is
with regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be
sufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On
account of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided
for two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to
Trincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in
Coromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in
his prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,
however, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this
grain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good
deal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,
a large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company
with authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps
also the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be
prevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so
less, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,
since the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting
them.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van
Mydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,
which may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of
provisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it
is no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions
for the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in
case of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,
a last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all
45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,
1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of
rice.This would be about the number of people the Company would
have to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are
according to the latest regulations 600 Company's servants, while
there are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,
and slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be
fed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also
Manaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a
sufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This
must also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are
well provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some
of the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice
from the Company's stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to
prevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.It was the intention
of His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company's stores
should be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Care must
be taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened
that some of the Company's servants sent natives on their behalf,
who then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This
was mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,
1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can
always be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think
600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient
number of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not
suffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must
also be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities
in this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,
and therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store
houses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000
lb.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,
and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind
enough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle
last August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become
stale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,
with authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may
not go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency
van Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and
bacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every
three or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to
some of the Company's vessels.But considering that His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position
to supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,
as there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,
it would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen
that in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept
within the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,
while as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could
be got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This
small loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to
protect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense
could be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat
[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,
[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because
this dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except
for the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,
because used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as
it does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many
complaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the
pearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is
not properly served in this respect.On this account also some arrack
was returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth
no arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,
neither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different
stations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by
the people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it
in the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With
regard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,
but that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock
taking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient
store of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,
instruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes
for the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the
artillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,
muskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that
Your Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket
barrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be
found in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained
for gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,
I think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready
when wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and
tar for the preservation both of the sloops and the gun-carriages,
which otherwise will soon decay during the heavy rains which we have
here in India.Although the Arsenal is at present well provided with
guns and muskets, it is possible that half of them may be found unfit
for use.I have therefore given orders to examine them all carefully,
so that those that are unfit may be sent to Colombo and from there to
the Fatherland, and new ones returned.Water and fuel are also two of
the most important things to think of for the defence of a fortress,
and I had therefore a large room built behind the smith's shop where
fuel could be stored away.This room must be stocked and closed, and
no fuel issued from it to any one.Those who receive firewood from
the Company may be supplied from that which is daily brought from the
forest.With regard to the water which is found within this Castle,
it is drinkable in cases of emergency, especially in some of the
wells found there.[55]

The military and garrison would be sufficiently strong if the full
number of Europeans allowed for this Commandement by the latest
Batavian regulation of December 29, 1692, could be obtained, which
could not be considered too strong for a Commandement numbering
608 men in all, including those for commercial, civil, judicial,
ecclesiastical, naval, and military services.At present we have only
the following number of persons in the Company's service, who have
to be classified, as they are of different colour and descent, viz.:--


                            Europeans.In the Castle              287         56        7       350
    In Manaar                   52          2        9        63
    In Hammenhiel               21          4        1        26
    In Ponneryn                  1          1       21        23
    In the redoubts the
    "Pyl," "Beschutter,"
    and "Elephant"              11          3       45        59
    For various services,
    also in the Island,
    for  surveying, wood
    felling, &c.13         10        2        25
                               ===        ===      ===       ===
                    Total      385         76       85       546


In the number of Europeans is included, as stated above, all manner
of Company's servants employed in the Trade, Church, Navigation,
Military Duties, &c., all of which together number 385 men.The 76
mestises and the 85 toepasses will therefore have to be retained until
this Commandement can have its full number of Europeans, and it would
be well if Your Honours would continue to engage a few more toepasses
when they offer themselves, because the Passes are hardly sufficiently
guarded; about which matter communication has been made in our letter
to Colombo of March 5, 1695.Your Honours must also keep in mind the
recommendation of His Excellency van Mydregt in his letter of March
27, 1688, wherein he suggests that a close watch should be kept on
the Wannias, as they are not to be trusted in a case of treason on
the part of the Sinhalese; and on this account the advanced guards
must be always well provided with ammunition and provisions, while
discipline and drill must be well attended to, so that as far as lies
in our power we may be prepared for emergencies.I have been rather prolix in treating of the fortifications and all
that pertains thereto, not so much because I am ignorant of the fact
that the Company's power in India depends more on her naval force
than on her fortresses, but because I consider that since the latter
are in our possession it is our duty to preserve them, as otherwise
the large amount expended on them at the beginning of the Government
in Ceylon would have been spent in vain.[56]

The public works are carried out here without expenditure to the
Company by the Oeliaars, because, as stated before, no cooly wages
are paid here, payment being made only to the native artisans, such
as smiths, carpenters, and masons.The number of men employed is
daily entered in a book by one of the Pennisten of the Comptoirs,
which he has to hand over in the evening to the person whose turn
it will be the next day to do this work.Care must be taken that
these assistants personally see and count the men, and the payments
must be made according to their list and not according to those of
the Dutch foremen or the native Cannecappuls.This is in compliance
with the orders from Batavia.The foremen of the carpenters' yard,
the smiths' shop, the gunpowder mill, and the masonry works must
also every evening, at sunset, bring in their reports with regard to
the progress of the work.This is to be done by the sergeant Hendrik
Rademaker, who, for some years, has been acting as overseer of the
Oeliaars.The Oeliaars are changed on Mondays and Thursdays, each
of them working only for three days at a time, which suffices for
three months, as they owe twelve days of service in the year.Those
who have performed their labour receive an ola from the Cannecappul,
which is called a Sito, and is marked with a steel stamp thus: I-VOC,
which serves them as a receipt.The names of those who fail to appear
are written down by the Cannecappul and by the Majoraal, and they
have to pay a fine which is called sicos.[60] The stamp is in the
custody of the Chief, who also arranges and divides the work among
the Oeliaars.He must see that the sergeant does not allow any of
the coolies to depart before the three days have expired, and making
a profit for himself and causing loss to the Company.Care must also
be taken that no more than 18 persons are employed as Pandarepulles
or native cooly drivers, who are each in charge of 16 to 30 men,
whom they have to keep to their work.These 18 Pandarepulles must be
appointed by written documents, otherwise the sergeant appoints such
officers on his own authority and thus also makes a profit.Then
also it must be seen that the materials, such as timber, bricks,
lime, &c., are not taken to other places than they have been ordered
for by the person in authority, for all these are tricks to which
the Company is subject on the part of the overseers when they see
that no regard is taken of their doings.The principal of the public
works at present in progress is the building of the church within the
fort, [61] which has advanced to 8 feet above the ground, and may be
completed during the southern season, if there is only a sufficient
quantity of bricks.According to my calculation about 1,000,000 more
will be required, which is a large quantity, but will not cost more
than 3 fannums per thousand, and even this expense does not fall to
the Company, but may be found out of the sicos or fines.The Dessave
has the best opportunity for seeing that the work at the brickworks
at Iroewale is pushed on as quickly as possible, so that there may
be no waiting for bricks or tiles, which are also baked there and
paid at the rate of 3 1/2 fannums a thousand.I consider it a shame
that in a country where the cost of building is so small, and where
religion is to be promoted, there should not even be a church in
the fort, a state of things that has existed these last four years,
during which the warehouses had to be used for this purpose, while
many old and infirm people could not attend the services because of
the inconvenience of the steps that lead to them.It would have been
better if the old Portuguese church had not been broken down before
the building of the new church was commenced, because an old proverb
says: "That one must not cast away old shoes till one has got new
ones."[62] However, for the present we must row with the oars we
possess, until the new church is completed, the plan for which is in
the hands of the surveyor Martinus Leusekam.The sergeant in the Wanni,
Harmen Claasz, had already on my orders felled the necessary beams,
and now the rafters must be thought of, which would be best made
of palmyra wood, if they could be obtained sufficiently long.The
timber for the pulpit I hope to send from Mallabaar, but as ebony is
also found in the Wanni, some trees might be felled also there and be
brought down here without expenditure to the Company.As may be seen
in the answers to the questions from Jaffnapatam of March 12, 1691,
and February 17, 1692, authority for the building of this church was
obtained long ago.The only other works required within the Castle
at present are the barracks for the married soldiers; which may be
found indicated in the map, and the rebuilding of the four dwelling
houses yet remaining of the Portuguese buildings which are old and
decayed.They are no longer worth repairing, and it would be best
if they were broken down and new and better houses built on their
site.But before this is done it will be necessary to rebuild the
Armoury, which fell into ruins last December.This building also
remained from the Portuguese.Some new tiles are also required for
the Company's building at Anecatte where the red-dyeing is done,
the cross-beams of which building I had renewed.Likewise a number
of tiles is required for the new warehouses in the island Leyden,
which have been built there in compliance with the orders of His
late Excellency van Mydregt.This was when it was intended to provide
Ceylon with grain from Tansjouwer, [63] which was to be laid up there
before the northern season.These warehouses may yet come in useful
if the Moorish trade flourishes.[57]

The horse stable within the fort has been built in a bad place,
and is very close and unhealthy; so that the animals die one after
another.It would therefore be better if the stable referred to
under the heading of "fortification" and situated outside the fort be
used.If this is done it must be provided with the necessary cribs,
&c., and not more than seven horses have been allowed by the last
regulation.The supervision of the stable has been entrusted for some
time to the Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but I could not approve of
this, and consider it better that this supervision be also left to
the chief person in authority, the more so as the said Captain has
been troubled for the last five years with gout and gravel; so that
he has often to remain at home for weeks, while, even when he is well,
it is impossible for him to go about much, in consequence of weakness
arising from the pain.For this reason he cannot properly supervise
the stable; and this is not the first time he is excused from his
duty, as it was done also during the time of Commandeur Cornelis van
der Duyn, who also considered that it was more in the interest of
the Company that this and other duties should be performed by the
chief instead of by private persons.The Dessave is best aware if
the hides of the stags and elks sent to this stable from the Wanny
and the Passes are properly utilized for saddles, carriages, &c.,
in the said stable, and also in the Arsenal for cartridge cases,
bandoleers, sword-belts, &c.[58]

The hospital was built too low, so that the patients had to lie in
damp places during the northern monsoon.I therefore had the floor
raised, in view of the fact that this is a place where the Company
shows its sympathy with its suffering servants and wishes them to have
every comfort.For this reason also regents are appointed to see that
nothing wrong is done by the doctor or the steward.For some time this
supervision was entrusted to Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but for the
reason stated above I cannot approve of the arrangement any longer,
while moreover, his daughter is the wife of the Chief Surgeon Hendrick
Warnar, who has a very large family, and suspicious people might try to
find fault with the arrangement.The supervision of the hospital must
therefore be entrusted every alternate month to the Administrateur
Biermans and the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, as it is against the
principles of the Company to entrust such work to one person only.[59]

The Company's slaves here are few in number, consisting of 82
individuals, including men, boys, women, and children.But no more are
required, as the Oeliaars perform many of the duties for which slaves
would be otherwise required.They are employed in the stable, the
warehouses, the arsenal, the hospital, and with the shipbuilders and
masons.The only pay they receive is 3 fannums and a parra of rice per
month, except some of the masons.This payment is sufficient for some
of them, but not for all, as there are some employed in masonry work
who do their work as well as any of the natives, and, as they have to
maintain a wife and children, the master mason has often recommended
higher pay for them.There is one among the masons who receives
6 fannums a month, another gets 4, and two others 3 fannums.This
might be raised from 6 to 10, from 4 to 8, and from 3 to 6 fannums
respectively, so that these poor people may not be discouraged; and on
the other hand increased pay often produces increased labour, and thus
the Company would perhaps not lose by the extra expense.The matter
must, however, be submitted to His Excellency the Governor, as also
the request of one of the masons that his daughter may be emancipated,
in order to marry a native who has proposed to her.The father offers
in her place as a slave another young and capable woman.There is also
another application for emancipation from a dyer who is now, he says,
60 years of age.The Company would lose nothing in granting this
request, because all he delivers is two or three pieces of ordinary
chintz a year.All these matters must be submitted to His Excellency
the Governor and the Council.[60]

Having now treated of the Wanny, of the lands of Ponneryn and Mantotte
within the Province of Jaffnapatam, and of the fort, we must see what
is to be said with regard to the seacoast, and also if any important
matter has been forgotten.Manaar is the last island on this side, and the banks and islets near
it form together what is called "Adam's Bridge," which closes the
passage between Ceylon and Coromandel.This island also protects
Jaffnapatam on the south, as no vessel could come here without
passing Manaar.The passage through the river is so inconvenient on
account of its shallowness that no vessel can pass without being first
unloaded.Therefore no vessel is able to pass nor any smuggling take
place without its being known in Manaar.It is on this account that
an order was issued by His Excellency the Governor and the Council
in their letter of March 5, 1695, to Jaffnapatam, to the effect that
no smuggled areca-nut from Colombo or Calpentyn must be allowed to
pass there.This was when the trade in these waters was re-opened
for private enterprise from Coromandel, and the order was conveyed
by us to Manaar by letter of March 11.A close watch must be kept,
but so long as the passage of Ramacoil or Lembe in the domain of the
Teuver is so well known by some people as it is said to be, it is
not likely that attempts at smuggling would be made in Manaar.[61]

Manaar not only protects Jaffnapatam, but it also yields to the
Company the profits of Mantotte, Moesely, and Setticoulang, and of
the capture of elephants.The latter might be more if not for the
death of the animals, as, for instance, last year, when not a single
animal delivered by the hunters survived.The hunters must therefore
be encouraged to bring as many as possible.[62]

About 50 or 60 bharen of dye-roots are also yearly obtained from
Manaar, which cultivation must also be attended to, in order that
the Company may be in a position to deliver the red cloths ordered
from this Commandement.[63]

Some revenue is also obtained from taxes and rents.These are yearly
sold to the highest bidder.Last year they were sold for 1 1/2 year,
like those in Jaffnapatam.2,268, as also
Rds.879.7.8 for poll tax and land rent in Manaar.The tithes of the
harvest in Mantotte are paid in grain, which is usually issued to the
Company's servants.This amounted on the last occasion to 1,562 1/2
paras of rice.The tax in cooking butter in Mantotte is also paid
in kind and likewise issued to the Company's servants.Besides,
there are 3,000 or 4,000 paras of salt and 10,000 or 12,000 coils
of straw or bark lunt which the inhabitants of the opposite lands
have to deliver, as also chanks from the divers; but these do not
amount to much, for, in 1695, were dived five kinds of cauries to
the amount of 204 5/8 paras, and in 1696 only 94 7/8 paras; so that
the amount for two years was only 299 1/2 paras of cauries.For this
reason I submitted on May 10, 1695, to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council, a proposal from the Moor Perietamby, who offered to
pay the Company yearly Rds.8,000 for the license to dive for chanks
between Manaar and Calpentyn.This was refused by the reply received
from Colombo on the 17th of the same month.[64]

From the Instructions to Commandeur Blom sent from Colombo on February
17, 1692, it may be seen what prices are paid to the divers for the
chanks, mentioned already under the subject of the Moorish trade,
so that it is not necessary to enter into detail on the subject here.I think that I have now sufficiently explained all matters relating to
this station, and would refer for further information to the report
compiled by Mr.Blom for Governor van Mydregt, which is kept here at
the Secretariate, [64] as also the answers thereto of September 13 and
October 7, 1690.Jorephaas
Vosch for the Opperkoopman Jan de Vogel, bearing date August 30, 1666,
[65] which may also be read, but I think that I have mentioned all
the most important matters with regard to Manaar appearing therein.The pearl fishery is an extraordinary enterprise, the success of
which depends on various circumstances; as there are various causes
by which the banks or the oysters may be destroyed.It would take too
long to mention here all that may be said on the subject, and as it
would be tiresome to read it all, I will merely state here that the
usual place for the fishery is near Aripo in the Bay of Condaatje,
where the banks lie, and if no untoward events take place, a fishery
may be held for several years in succession; because the whole bay
is covered with different banks, the oysters of which will become
successively matured.But sometimes they are washed away and completely
destroyed within a very short time.The banks are to be inspected in
November by a Commission sent for this purpose, who come in tonys from
Jaffnapatam, Manaar, and Madura, and with them also some Patangatyns
and other native chiefs who understand this work.The chief points to
be considered when a pearl fishery has been authorized are the lodgings
for the Commissioners appointed in Colombo; the inclosure of the tanks
in Mantotte with banks for obtaining good drinking water; the supply
of poultry, butter, oil, rice, sheep, cattle, &c., for provisions;
Lascoreens and servants; military men, if they can be spared from
the garrison, &c. The fishery usually takes place in the months of
March, April, and May.I will not enter into detail on this matter,
as it would not be in agreement with the nature of these instructions;
while the Commissioners will be able to find ample information in the
various documents of the years 1666 and 1667, but especially in those
of 1694, 1695, and 1696, including reports, journals, and letters, in
case they have not gained sufficient experience yet.These documents
relate to the fishery, the collection of the Company's duties, the
purchase and valuation of pearls, &c. I will therefore only state
here the successive profits derived from the pearl fishery by the
Company, viz.:--


                   Rds.1666       19,655    91/980       58,965.11.6
        1667       24,641   461/968       73,924.8.13
        1694       21,019    19/60        63,057.13.0
        1695       24,708    11/12        74,126.15.0
        1696       25,327    43/60        75,983.0
                  =======   =======      =============
           Total  115,352   499/960      346,057.11.3 [66]


This is a considerable amount, and it is expected, according to the
reports of the Commissioners, that the fishery now authorized for
December 31, 1697, will yield still greater profits.I have already
given orders for the repair of the banks of the tanks in Mantotte,
which were damaged during the last storm, in order that there may
be no want of drinking water, which is one of the most important
points.Whether the prohibition to export coconuts from this Province
applies also to the pearl fishery is a matter to be submitted to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council; because many people use
this fruit as food.This subject has been already dealt with under
the head of Coconuts.[65]

The inhabited little islands are considered as the fifth Province
of the Commandement, the others being Walligammo, Waddemoraatsche,
Timmeraatsche, and Patchelepalle.Taxes, &c., are levied in these
islands in the same way as in the other Provinces, the revenue
amounting last time to Rds.2,767.2.5 1/2, viz.:--


                                              Rds.Land rent                                1,190.11.3

The islands are named as follows:--

Carredive, called by us Amsterdam; Tamiedive, Leyden; Pongedive,
Middleburg; Nerendive, Delft; Neynadive, Haarlem; Aneledive, Rotterdam;
Remedive, "de Twee Gebroeders," or Hoorn and Enkhuisen.Besides the revenue stated above, Carredive yields the best dye-roots
in this Commandement, although the quantity is no more than 10 or
12 bharen a year.The dye-roots from Delft are just as good, but it
yields only 4 or 5 bharen a year.Salt, lime, and coral stone are
also obtained from these islands, but particulars with regard to these
matters have been stated at length in the report by the late Commandeur
Blom to His late Excellency van Mydregt, to which I would refer.[66]

Horse-breeding is an enterprise of which much was expected, but so far
the Company has not made much profit by it.Yet there is no reason
to despair, and better results may be hoped for.Your Honours must
remember that formerly in the islands Delft, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen all
kinds of horses were bred together; so that but few good animals were
obtained.In 1690 and 1691 orders were given to shoot all horses that
were too small or defective, and to capture the rest and send them to
Colombo and Coromandel.The latter were sold at Negapatam by public
auction, while the rest were given to soldiers on the opposite coast
in the Company's service, who used the animals so badly that they were
soon unfit for work.In this way the islands have become destitute
of horses, and the only thing to be done was to send there some good
mares and two or three Persian stallions for breeding purposes.So
far no good horses could be obtained, because a foal has to be 4 or
3 1/2 years old before it is fit for use.It is only since 1692,
1693, and 1694 that we had good stallions, and this accounts for
the fact that no foals have yet been obtained.8,982.9, so that it would seem as if expenditure and
trouble are the only results to be expected from this enterprise;
but it must be remembered that at present there are on the island of
Delft alone about 400 or 500 foals of 1, 1 1/2, 2, and 2 1/2 years
old, while there are also a number of horses on the island "de Twee
Gebroeders."The expenditure was incurred mostly in the purchase of the
Persian stallions, and this expenditure has not been in vain, because
we possess now more than 400 horses, each of which will be worth about
a hundred guilders, so that the whole number will be worth about 40,000
guilders.In compliance with the orders by His Excellency van Mydregt
of November 29, 1690, these animals must be sold at Coromandel on
account of this Commandement, and the valuation of the horses may be
determined from the fact that the Prince of Tansjour has accepted one
or two of them in lieu of the recognition which the Company owes him
yearly for two Arabian horses.For this reason and in compliance with
the said orders the first horses captured must be sent to Negapatam,
so that the account in respect of horse-breeding may be balanced.As
the stallions kept on the islands have become too old, application
has been made for younger animals, and also for five or six mares
from Java, which have been granted by His Excellency the Governor
and the Council in their letter of April 29, 1695.Your Honours are
further advised not to sell any horses from the island of Delft for
less than Rds.25 and from the islands "de Twee Gebroeders" for less
than Rds.35 to the Company's servants, as they fetch more than that
at the public auctions in Negapatam.Even this is a favour to them;
but I noticed that the horses from Delft have been sold at 15 and
those from Hoorn and Enkhuisen at Rds.20, which I think cannot be
done in future, since the destruction of the defective animals has
improved the race.I hope that this will clear up the passage with
regard to the horse-breeding in the letter from Batavia to Ceylon of
July 3, 1696, as also that Their Excellencies may be satisfied with
the result.I think expectations were raised too high at first; as
the real advantage could only be known in course of time; while, on
the other hand, the capital expended must be looked upon as standing
out on interest.[67]

The Passes of this Commandement are various, but all are guarded in
such a way that no goods can be brought in or taken out without a
license, nor are people able to go through without a passport.At
Kayts and Point Pedro passports are issued in the usual way to
those who come or go by sea; while to those who travel by land an
Acte of Permission is issued, which is written in Mallabaar on ola,
and is called Cayoppe.These are issued both by the Dessave and by
the Commandeur, but as so many thousands of people come and go, and
the signing of these Cayoppes occupies so much of the time of the
Commandeurs, a steel stamp is used now by the Dessave to mark these
also.I have followed the same practice, and used a seal with the
letters H. Z., [68] which I handed over shortly before my departure for
Colombo in February, 1696, to the Political Council, together with the
seal for the oely service, with instructions that these seals were to
be used just as if I were still on the spot, because the Dessave was
absent at the pearl fishery, and I was commissioned by the Supreme
Government of India to proceed to Mallabaar without being formally
relieved of my office in this Commandement.On my return from Colombo
in August I found that this order had not been carried out, but that
the Captain Jan van der Bruggen had thought it well to have another
seal specially made, with the monogram VOC, not only suppressing my
order given to him in full Council, but also having a new seal made,
which was beyond his authority and seemed to me quite out of place.I
cannot account for his extraordinary conduct in any other way than by
supposing that he desired to confirm the rumour which had been spread
among the natives and Europeans during the time of the Commissioners
Messrs.Jan van Keulen and Pieter Petitfilz, that I would never return
to this Commandement to rule, and thus by suppressing my seal to give
public confirmation to this rumour, and so make it appear to the world
that it was no longer legal.I therefore order again that this seal is
not to be suppressed, but used for the stamping of the Cayoppes at the
Passes in case the Dessave should be absent from this Commandement,
it being his province alone to issue and sign such olas.This order
is to be carried out as long as no contrary orders are received from
higher authorities.Colomboture and Catsay are two Passes on the inner boundary of this
Commandement at the river leading to Ponneryn and the Wanny, and
in order to prevent any one passing without a passport a guard is
stationed there.The duties on goods are also collected there, being
leased out, but they do not amount to much.These Passes, however,
must be properly guarded, and care taken that the people stationed
there submit their reports regularly.One of these may be found in
a letter from here to Colombo of December 12 last.Ponneryn, a good redoubt, serves as a place from where to watch the
doings of the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from invasions.It
is garrisoned by Toepasses under the command of a Dutch Sergeant.The Passes Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter serve chiefly to close this
Province against the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from
invasions of the Sinhalese, and also to prevent persons passing in
or out without a passport, or goods being taken in or out without a
license, as also to prevent the theft of slaves and the incursions of
elephants and other wild animals into the Provinces.A difficulty is
that the earth mounds are not close together, so that notwithstanding
the continual patrol of the militia, now and again a person passes
through unnoticed.Means of drawing these redoubts together, or at
least of making a trench to prevent persons or goods from passing
without a license, have often been considered.Some have proposed
a hedge of palmyra trees, others a fence of thorns, others a moat,
others again a wall, because at this point the Commandement measures
only two miles in breadth.But none of these proposals have been
adopted all these years, as stated in our letter of August 24, 1695,
to Batavia.Their Excellencies replied in their letter of July 3,
1696, that this is a good work, but as it is entirely to the advantage
of the inhabitants it must be carried out without expense to the
Company.This, in my humble opinion, is quite fair, and the Dessave,
whom this matter principally concerns, will have to consider in what
way such a trench as proposed could be made.The yearly Compendium
will give much information on this subject, and will show what defects
and obstacles have been met with.It has been stated already how the
Passes are garrisoned, and they are commanded by an Ensign according
to the regulations.Point Pedro, on the outer boundary of this Commandement, has resident
only one Corporal and four Lascoreens, who are chiefly employed in
the sending and receiving of letters to and from Coromandel and
Trincomalee, in the loading of palmyra wood and other goods sent
from there to the said two places, and in the search of departing
and arriving private vessels, and the receipt of passports.These men
also supervise the Oeliaars who have to work at the church which was
commenced during the time of Commandeur Blom, and also those who have
to burn lime or break coral stone from the old Portuguese fortress.The fortress Kayts or Hammenhiel serves on the north, like Manaar
in the south, to guard the passage by water to this Castle, and
also serves the same purposes as Point Pedro, viz., the searching of
private vessels, &c. Next to this fort is the island Leyden, where is
stationed at present the Assistant Jacob Verhagen, who performs the
same duties as the Corporal at Point Pedro, which may be found stated
more in detail in the Instructions of January 4, 1696, compiled and
issued by me for the said Assistant.The Ensign at the Passes received
his instructions from Commandeur Blom, all of which must be followed.As the Dessave is Commander over the military scattered in the
country, and therefore also over those stationed at the said Passes
and stations, it will chiefly be his duty to see that they are
properly guarded so far as the small garrison here will permit,
and also that they are provided with sufficient ammunition and
provisions.The latter consist mostly of grain, oil, pepper, and
arrack.This is mostly meant for Hammenhiel, as the other places can
always be provided from the land side, but rice and ammunition must be
always kept in store.Hammenhiel must be specially garrisoned during
the southern monsoon, and be manned as much as possible by Dutchmen,
who, if possible, must be transferred every three months, because many
of these places are very unhealthy and others exceedingly lonesome,
for which reasons it is not good to keep the people very long in one
place.The chief officers are transferred every six months, which also
must not be neglected, as it is a good rule in more than one respect.Aripo, Elipoecarrewe, and Palmeraincattoe were formerly fortresses
garrisoned like the others, but since the revolution of the Sinhalese
and the Wannias of 1675, under the Dessave Tinnekon, these have
become unnecessary and are only guarded now by Lascoreens, who are
mostly kept on for the transport of letters between Colombo, Manaar,
and Jaffnapatam.[68]

Water tanks are here very necessary, because the country has no fresh
water rivers, and the water for the cultivation of lands is that which
is collected during the rainfall.Some wealthy and influential natives
contrived to take possession of the tanks during the time the Company
sold lands, with a view of thus having power over their neighbours
and of forcing them to deliver up to them a large proportion of their
harvests.They had to do this if they wished to obtain water for
the cultivation of their fields, and were compelled thus to buy at
high price that which comes as a blessing from the Lord to all men,
plants, and animals in general.His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then
Governor of Ceylon, issued an order in June, 1687, on his visit to
this Commandement, that for these reasons no tanks should be private
property, but should be left for common use, the owners being paid
by those who require to water their fields as much as they could
prove to have spent on these tanks.I found that this good order
has not been carried out, because the family of Sangere Pulle alone
possesses at present three such tanks, one of which is the property
of Moddely Tamby.Before my departure to Colombo I had ordered that
it should be given over to the surrounding landowners, who at once
offered to pay the required amount, but I heard on my return that
the conveyance had not been made yet by that unbearably proud and
obstinate Bellale caste, they being encouraged by the way their patron
Moddely Tamby had been favoured in Colombo, and the Commandeur is
not even recognized and his orders are passed by.Your Honours must
therefore see that my instructions with regard to these tanks are
carried out, and that they are paid for by those interested, or that
they are otherwise confiscated, in compliance with the Instructions
of 1687 mentioned above, which Instructions may be found among the
papers in the Mallabaar language kept by the schoolmasters of the
parishes.Considering that many of the Instructions are preserved in
the native language only, they ought to be collected and translated
into our Dutch language.[69]

The public roads must be maintained at a certain breadth, and the
natives are obliged to keep them in order.But their meanness and
impudence is so great that they have gradually, year by year, extended
the fences along their lands on to these roads, thus encroaching
upon the high road.They see more and more that land is valuable on
account of the harvests, and therefore do not leave a foot of ground
uncultivated when the time of the rainy season is near.This is quite
different from formerly; so much so, that the lands are worth not
only thrice but about four or five times as much as formerly.This
may be seen when the lands are sold by public auction, and it may
be also considered whether the people of Jaffnapatam are really so
badly off as to find it necessary to agitate for an abatement of the
tithes.The Dessave must therefore see that these roads are extended
again to their original breadth and condition, punishing those who
may have encroached on the roads.[70]

The Company's elephant stalls have been allowed to fall into decay
like the churches, and they must be repaired as soon as possible,
which is also a matter within the province of the Dessave.[71]

Great expectations were cherished by some with regard to the thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Besoar stones, Carret, and tusks from the
elephants that died in the Company's stalls, but experience did
not justify these hopes.As these points have been dealt with in the
Compendium of November 26, 1693, by Commandeur Blom, I would here refer
to that document.I cannot add anything to what is stated there.[72]

The General Paresse is a ceremony which the Mudaliyars, Collectors,
Majoraals, Aratchchies, &c., have to perform twice a year on behalf
of the whole community, appearing together before the Commandeur in
the fort.This is an obligation to which they have been subject from
heathen times, partly to show their submission, partly to report on
the condition of the country, and partly to give them an opportunity
to make any request for the general welfare.As this Paresse tends
to the interest of the Company as Sovereign Power on the one hand
and to that of the inhabitants on the other hand, the custom must be
kept up.When the Commandeur is absent at the time of this Paresse
Your Honours could meet together and receive the chiefs.It is held
once during the northern and once during the southern monsoon, without
being bound to any special day, as circumstances may require it to be
held earlier or later.During my absence the day is to be fixed by the
Dessave, as land regent.Any proposal made by the native chiefs must
be carefully written down by the Secretary, so that it may be possible
to send a report of it to His Excellency the Governor and the Council
if it should be of importance.All transactions must be carefully
noted down and inserted in the journal, so that it may be referred to
whenever necessary.The practice introduced by the Onderkoopman William
de Ridder in Manaar of requiring the Pattangatyns from the opposite
coast to attend not twice but twelve times a year or once a month is
unreasonable, and the people have rightly complained thereof.De Ridder also appointed
a second Cannekappul, which seems quite unnecessary, considering the
small amount of work to be done there for the natives.Jeronimo could
be discharged and Gonsalvo retained, the latter having been specially
sent from Calpentyn by His Excellency Governor Thomas van Rhee and
being the senior in the service.Of how little consequence the work
at Manaar was considered by His Excellency Governor van Mydregt may
be seen from the fact that His Excellency ordered that no Opperhoofd
should be stationed there nor any accounts kept, but that the fort
should be commanded by an Ensign as chief of the military.A second
Cannekappul is therefore superfluous, and the Company could be saved
the extra expense.[73]

I could make reference to a large number of other matters, but it
would be tedious to read and remember them all.I will therefore now
leave in Your Honours' care the government of a Commandement from which
much profit may be derived for the Company, and where the inhabitants,
though deceitful, cunning, and difficult to rule, yet obey through
fear; as they are cowardly, and will do what is right more from fear of
punishment than from love of righteousness.I hope that Your Honours
may have a more peaceful time than I had, for you are well aware
how many difficulties, persecutions, and public slights I have had to
contend with, and how difficult my government was through these causes,
and through continual indisposition, especially of late.However,
Jaffnapatam has been blessed by God during that period, as may be seen
from what has been stated in this Memoir.I hope that Your Honours'
dilligence and experience may supplement the defects in this Memoir,
and, above all, that you will try to live and work together in harmony,
for in that way the Company will be served best.There are people who
will purposely cause dissension among the members of the Council,
with a view to further their own ends or that of some other party,
much to the injury of the person who permits them to do so.[74]

The Political Council consists at present of the following members:--


Ryklof de Bitter, Dessave, Opperkoopman.Abraham M. Biermans, Administrateur.Pieter Boscho, Onderkoopman, Store- and Thombo-keeper.Johannes van Groenevelde, Fiscaal.Pieter Bout, Cashier and Secretary.With a view to enable His Excellency the Governor and the Council to
alter or amplify this Memoir in compliance with the orders from Their
Excellencies at Batavia, cited at the commencement of this document,
I have purposely written on half of the pages only, so that final
instructions might be added, as mine are only provisional.In case
Your Honours should require any of the documents cited which are
not kept here at the Secretariate, they may be applied for from His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.Wishing Your
Honours God's blessing, and all prosperity in the administration of
this extensive Commandement,


I remain, Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
H. ZWAARDECROON.Jaffnapatam, January 1, 1697.A.--The above Instructions were ready for Your Honours when, on
January 31 last, the yacht "Bekenstyn" brought a letter from Colombo
dated January 18, in which we were informed of the arrival of our new
Governor, His Excellency Gerrit de Heere.By the same vessel an extract
was sent from a letter of the Supreme Government of India of October
19 last, in which my transfer to Mallabaar has been ordered.But,
much as I had wished to serve the Company on that coast, I could
not at once obey the order owing to a serious illness accompanied
by a fit, with which it pleased the Lord to afflict me on January
18.Although not yet quite recovered, I have preferred to undertake
the voyage to Mallabaar without putting it off for another six months,
trusting that God will help me duly to serve my superiors, although
the latter course seemed more advisable on account of my state of
health.As some matters have occurred and some questions have arisen
since the writing of my Memoir, I have to add here a few explanations.B.--Together with the above-mentioned letter from Colombo, of January
18, we also received a document signed by both Their Excellencies
Governors Thomas van Rhee and Gerrit de Heere, by which all trade
in Ceylon except that of cinnamon is made open and free to every
one.Since no extract from the letter from Batavia with regard to this
matter was enclosed, I have been in doubt as to how far the permission
spoken of in that document was to be extended.As I am setting down
here my doubt on this point, His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo will, I have no doubt, give further information
upon it.I suppose that the trade in elephants is excepted as well
as that in cinnamon, and that it is still prohibited to capture,
transport, or sell these animals otherwise than on behalf of the
Company, either directly or indirectly, as has been the usage so far.C.--I suppose there will be no necessity now to obtain the areca-nuts
as ordered in the Instructions from Colombo of March 23, 1695, but
that these nuts are included among the articles open to free trade,
so that they may be now brought from Jaffnapatam through the Wanni to
Tondy, Madura, and Coromandel, as well as to other places in Ceylon,
provided the payment of the usual Customs duty of the Alphandigo,
[69] which is 7 1/2 per cent.for export, and that it may also be
freely transported through the Passes on the borders of the Wanni, and
that no Customs duty is to be paid except when it is sent by sea.I
understand that the same will be the rule for cotton, pepper, &c.,
brought from the Wanni to be sent by sea.This will greatly increase
the Alphandigo, so that the conditions for the farming of these must
be altered for the future accordingly.If the Customs duty were also
charged at the Passes, the farming out of these would still increase,
but I do not think that it would benefit the Company very much, because
there are many opportunities for smuggling beyond these three Passes,
and the expenditure of keeping guards would be far too great.The
duty being recovered as Alphandigo, there is no chance of smuggling,
as the vessels have to be provided with proper passports.All vessels
from Jaffnapatam are inspected at the Waterfort, Hammenhiel and at
the redoubt Point Pedro.D.--In my opinion the concession of free trade will necessitate the
remission of the duty on the Jaffnapatam native and foreign cloths,
because otherwise Jaffnapatam would be too heavily taxed compared
with other places, as the duty is 20 and 25 per cent.I think both
the cloths made here and those imported from outside ought to be
taxed through the Alphandigo of 7 1/2 per cent.This would still more
increase the duty, and this must be borne in mind when these revenues
are farmed out next December, if His Excellency the Governor and the
Council approve of my advice.is far too
high, and it must be remembered that this was a duty imposed with a
view to prevent the weaving of cloths and to secure the monopoly of
the trade to the Company, and not in order to make a revenue out of
it.This project did not prove a success; but I will not enter into
details about it, as these may be found in the questions submitted
by me to the Council of Ceylon on January 22, 1695, and I have also
mentioned them in this Memoir under the heading of Rents.E.--It seems to me that henceforth the people of Jaffnapatam would,
as a result of this free trade, be no longer bound to deliver to the
Company the usual 24 casks of coconut oil yearly before they are
allowed to export their nuts.This rule was laid down in a letter
from Colombo of October 13, 1696, with a view to prevent Ceylon being
obliged to obtain coconut oil from outside.This duty was imposed
upon Jaffnapatam, because the trees in Galle and Matura had become
unfruitful from the Company's elephants having to be fed with the
leaves.The same explanation was not urged with regard to Negombo,
which is so much nearer to Colombo than Galle, Matura, or Jaffnapatam,
and it is a well-known fact that many of the ships from Jaffnapatam
and other places are sent with coconuts from Negombo to Coromandel
or Tondel, while the nuts from the lands of the owners there are held
back.I expect therefore that the new Governor His Excellency Gerrit
de Heere and the Council of Colombo will give us further instructions
with regard to this matter.More details may be found in this Memoir
under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--A letter was received from Colombo, bearing date March 4 last,
in which was enclosed a form of a passport which appears to have been
introduced there after the opening of the free trade, with orders to
introduce the same here.This has been done already during my presence
here and must be continued.G.--In the letter of the 9th instant we received various and important
instructions which must be carried out.An answer to this letter was
sent by us on the 22nd of the same month.One of these instructions is
to the effect that a new road should be cut for the elephants which are
to be sent from Colombo.Another requires the compilation of various
lists, one of which is to be a list of all lands belonging to the
Company or given away on behalf of it, with a statement showing by
whom, to whom, when, and why they were granted.I do not think this
order refers to Jaffnapatam, because all fields were sold during the
time of Commandeur Vosch and others.Only a few small pieces of land
were discovered during the compilation of the new Land Thombo, which
some of the natives had been cultivating.A few wild palmyra trees
have been found in the Province of Patchelepalle, but these and the
lands have been entered in the new Thombo.We cannot therefore very
well furnish such a list of lands as regards Jaffnapatam, because
the Company does not possess any, but if desired a copy of the new
Land Thombo (which will consist of several reams of imperial paper)
could be sent.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is
not a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,
and it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is
being compiled.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the
Company through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so
much has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also
was the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A
difficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is
to be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from
Galconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount
of 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the
orders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to
be employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity
in the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated
that the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,
while on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that
the amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or
elephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not
wish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had
been arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without
my knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His
Excellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,
and follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said
cheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques
of two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my
departure.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these
people for want of time.The merchants of Golconda have also requested
that, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an
advance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request
has been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for
about nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000
paras of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,
belonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as
I am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be
purchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for
nely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,
however, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must
be consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of
Negapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted
wherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they
may be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make
provision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great
concern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also
of the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will
only add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price
has been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's
pontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had
been obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost
above 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from
Kayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring
had not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away
by the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in
the nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent
the native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain
both by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive
on account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate
this matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your
Honours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by
the Council.In future such matters must always be brought before
the Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own
authority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry
much weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30
or 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also
be made a practice in future that these people are held responsible
for their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,
as they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the
changing of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in
future I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except
directly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the
value of the Pagodas.He must send them to the cashier in packets of
100 at a time, which must be sealed.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by
me to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other
members of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the
Supreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19
last year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as
the chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,
it will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide
whether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the
administration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,


I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. ZWAARDECROON.On board the yacht "Bekenstyn," in the harbour of
Manaar, March 29, 1697.SHORT NOTES by Gerrit de Heere, Governor of the Island of Ceylon,
    on the chief points raised in these Instructions of Commandeur
    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman
    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the
    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of
    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders
    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the
    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies
    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must
be also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof
de Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of
Batavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the
Instructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to
Mr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications
of all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be
sufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and
this would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally
and in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of
the Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the
Governor.de Bitter and the other members of
Council to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the
Company into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to
some Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that
they should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2 alias (elephants).The
distribution of these tributes is as follows:--

                                                                 ======

The accumulated arrears from the years 1680 to 1694, of which they
were discharged, amounted to 333 1/2 elephants.From that time up to
the present day the arrears have again accumulated to 86 3/4 alias,
namely:--


                                                   Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane                        57 1/2

        Chedoega Welemapane                            1 1/2
                                                      ======
                     Total                            86 3/4


The result proves that all the honour and favours shown to these people
do not induce them to pay up their tribute; but on the contrary,
as has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on
increasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of
requesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would
be superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,
however, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious
terms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within
a year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,
I dismissed them.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
who owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused
by the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that
I would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I
agreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different
lands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them
to me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up
to the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties
to make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the
Company again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute
of 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this
than to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all
seen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a
bad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave
like boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I
see no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged
to do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon
as possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo
Poevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with
the orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be
allowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding
that he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale
must be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,
contained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,
Carnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,
and the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small
and consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,
however, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in
doing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the
tithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it
were paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by
supplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger
quantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,
as if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter
under the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which
will result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to
the effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip
Nellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe
the Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be
watched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which
the brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time
does not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by
officers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the
Company received from there a large number of elephants, besides the
tithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.The
two Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that
they do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the
inhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published
by Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,
any statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule
of the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed
to capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little
document, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the
hunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the
year 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be
found, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really
had to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate
this matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the
hunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the
capture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with
the orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should
be obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and
Mantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,
was doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an
average no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,
until in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of
Ponneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the
Lord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces
were granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don
Gaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which
could be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of
Ponneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as
their services should be required by the Company and as they had been
accustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;
because, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although
in the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44
animals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.:--


                                    Elephants.For 1690                4
                    1691-92             6

                             Total     44


During the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,
so that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,
131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and
did not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even
prevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;
and, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been
granted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the
Company, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised
over the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of
gift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of
their authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For
these reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary
for the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant
Albert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,
has gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which
was done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the
capture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of
the Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,
because the hunt has been greatly neglected.Your Honour may allow
both the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our
authorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as
the rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a
year.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to
Fl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated
in the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by
bidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this
was really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove
of the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been
carried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests
of the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute
the public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the
Company has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,
no more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least
prejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,
as all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may
be found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions
arrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily
resolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was
left with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed
methods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one
but Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged
and pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year
for the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all
be transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on
account of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a
little earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that
all the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the
20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,
ready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year
the Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants
for the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of
cash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200
animals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The
practice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of
public auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss
to the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the
Company also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals
do not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of
ready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it
must be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that
are to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all
preparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,
or, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile
all the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be
left behind on account of contrary winds.As we have now cut a road,
by which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,
as was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips
from Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here
with great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former
plan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and
Colombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and
proving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or
15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is
always required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be
fetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16
animals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,
but which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,
No 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may
be employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must
see that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don
Diogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted
among those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is
known to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the
animals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when
they were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and
consider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning
with No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have
been made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they
must begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross
must be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,
especially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best
way of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the
King's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's
territory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining
these nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these
people fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the
necessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason
why these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of
elephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase
as he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their
cash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which
should be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner
informed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,
but also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,
and this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all
appearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,
and Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make
up for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before
what number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a
quantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the
usual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they
did not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of
the required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by
the first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at
any price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way
that it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that
the taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the
inhabitants asked for this to be done.It will be the duty of the
Dessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,
which were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is
brought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with
the work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old
and infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the
list, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age
are entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,
and the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according
to the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays
his share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as
a whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by
the old method.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to
serve, must be looked after, as this is the only practicable means
of continuing the necessary works.The idea of raising the fine for
non-attendance from 2 stivers, which they willingly pay, to 4 stivers
or one fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise
already for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two
parties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked
by mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances
of the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be
well to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,
with a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent
in the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on
by every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended
to see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are
collected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,
because such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old
and infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must
still deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No
objections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken
in our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not
seem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of
the Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well
if these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions
of 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every
three years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when
an attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various
castes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered
advisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the
Company made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could
be brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when
they die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily
done.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that
the appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of
the actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or
until another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does
not mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor
of the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the
Commandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without
his knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused
by the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order
that Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better
for you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,
nor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and
all other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate
to us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice
in debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The
Dessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take
care that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as
Lascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be
excused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers
and is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in
Colombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to
be supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of
another famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out
very well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although
it is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must
be remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who
have but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of
the Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they
are not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present
at the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because
it is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company
by every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why
the concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor
of India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been
executed, and we consider that on account of the long interval that
has elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer
the Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,
will be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most
profitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number
than 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they
paid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a
larger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity
of food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many
slaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias
could make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so
that there is some reason for the question whether the Company does
not run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this
Commandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered
from chicken-pox since the importation of slaves, which may endanger
whole Provinces, I think it will be well to prevent the importation of
slaves.As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the
opposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of
rice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The
danger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as
the rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the
extreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they
would kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore
I think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,
not only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's
territory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly
guard against a monopoly being made of this grain.This opportunity
is taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this
Commandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the
native trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by
Mr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,
that all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point
Pedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,
in order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This
matter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties
are raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the
delivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering
the large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that
this could be easily done; because, according to what is published from
time to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that
during the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of
5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled
and the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that
one cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from
5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670
nuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole
supply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do
not understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,
and why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for
good payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts
it will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the
kinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express
my opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,
I found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the
oil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per
marcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,
10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They
also delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council
were bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it
was absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,
the excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own
requirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not
discuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful
and energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary
correspondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave
is present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel
tools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended
here must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and
Palecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the
Supreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should
be purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large
demand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking
that the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of
than that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no
more than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was
by no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable
wood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons
at Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore
specially request that during the next northern monsoon the following
are sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary
building operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in
two kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,
three out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that
this timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the
supervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to
any inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such
a person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,
and the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under
the heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound
to deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as
a substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were
sent last January as promised to Your Honour.This must, however,
be economically used.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience
than of importance.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting
this duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the
other hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well
if it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers
would not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,
as that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of
cost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000
paras from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in
payment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that
any amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed
by Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.But as
another order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel
for 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way
that I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would
add some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my
doing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of
foreign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,
must be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth
(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20
per cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term
at the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated
in the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are
prospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in
future, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been
given here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further
comments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders
at the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon
reduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed
to the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders
from the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution
of 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;
because, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to
14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--


                                                     Guilders.[74]
    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8
    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0
    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0
    Manuel of Anecotta                             8,539.6.0
    The Tannecares caste                           1,650.0.0
    Don Philip Nellamapane                           375.0.0
    Ambelewanner                                     150.0.0
                                                  ===========
                                      Total       14,118.11.8


Herein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to
the weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for
the delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them
later on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue
to be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I
have seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the
Company will make any profit on it; especially if the people should
get into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash
issued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from
Batavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,
that Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of
by Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,
but I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,
and inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,
Your Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not
act prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13
guilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,
and no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be
employed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they
need be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their
being discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the
natives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which
would be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so
many other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his
large number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also
openly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid
the vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of
Christianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference
whether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of
Jaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,
for whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously
enlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their
instruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6
guilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the
instructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11
elephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced
to him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from
the Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but
that the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,
but with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of
the Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the
Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already
employed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is
best to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard
to the passports must be followed pending further orders.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the
Court of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins
of Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient
knowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse
the documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,
but in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time
(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation
of the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the
surveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,
but every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In
case of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas
Isaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties
there, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the
Political Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time
of the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work
at the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in
Colombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice
by the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have
been made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must
be observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think
that the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient
for the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but
will refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the
Seminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this
large school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays
for the services and every day to call the children to school and
to meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to
see that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some
steps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be
considered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only
confirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the
improvement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I
have heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the
decay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur
to prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the
Memoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly
worthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been
held or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these
sittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur
in Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for
Mallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my
arrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also
that the election of the double number of members for this College had
twice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo
without a single meeting being held.It seems to me incomprehensible,
and as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every
week without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the
Commandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this
order is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a
meeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,
namely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur
Biermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has
been built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will
quite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as
proposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial
meetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,
as is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been
built already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up
a special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the
errors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place
should be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being
erected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes
or passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the
Castle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole
row of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect
new buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special
orders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly
observed.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I
cannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard
to the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage
Causes, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of
Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over
the last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage
and the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,
10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large
building and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been
chiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for
now, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to
Fl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of
finding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied
from the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf
of the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be
observed.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,
1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this
country.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems
to be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other
rogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that
none but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24
fannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in
payment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or
anywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment
laid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule
is observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the
Company's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the
annexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions
are given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be
still observed.Further information or instructions may be obtained
from Colombo.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the
fortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead
of raising any points or curtains.But improvements may be made,
such as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the
outside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,
as I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever
the canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some
places even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points
of the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be
very dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would
not stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the
artillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards
could be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the
stones being crushed by the wheels.I noticed further that each canon
stands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of
the curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are
fired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great
difficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It
would be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled
up.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;
this was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with
muskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This
deficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about
half a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could
be easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at
present whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur
or that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered
the removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which
can be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the
soldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,
and I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,
which was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,
and the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and
they must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of
the canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different
platforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which
can be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small
and the materials are at hand.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well
as those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as
yet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope
of its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that
experiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the
work has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the
Commissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work
continued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he
had to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.The
chief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the
coral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to
be blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but
lower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to
take fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should
be obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season
when the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are
not engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number
of labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not
undertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but
as the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,
it may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or
4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of
completing the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the
water, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,
&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It
would be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both
the outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work
would be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,
this is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I
admit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,
but the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great
deal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would
be just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite
the fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great
necessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and
stone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and
the carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed
by a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest
in that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it
would have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I
do not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that
corner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,
moreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could
be broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could
come near without being observed.As these buildings have been only
newly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the
orders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to
oppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I
found the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide
as it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places
also it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it
four or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not
think the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony
soil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing
even that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be
to direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make
them useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat
be deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a
level with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always
stand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during
the dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This
proposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,
in fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long
as the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity
for a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will
dispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,
which I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection
of the harbour and the river of Kaits.The sand bank and the wall
damaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir
is undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part
of the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and
it would be well if the project of Mr.This is a
very necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances
permit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because
the old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the
water tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch
bricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because
there are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the
full garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44
men, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the
advanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this
fortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt
was not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It
has been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam
on the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of
the moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be
removed.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,
and my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The
pavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of
the galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir
of brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be
surrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view
to prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise
likely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,
as it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend
returning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and
ammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a
wise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of
experience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially
with regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to
which we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as
far as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that
no extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on
the other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by
being kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except
that from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present
rice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it
necessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver
their rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat
and ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,
to be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to
be feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to
the account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the
Company all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in
future to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in
emergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to
capture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,
while dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack
must never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia
it is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be
done here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In
future bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who
accepted it.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,
to say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these
orders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a
sufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair
the old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to
Colombo.The storing away of fuel is a
praiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little
kept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as
in other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,
in order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who
came here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left
at Manaar and appointed to that station.I therefore do not think it
necessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to
reduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that
if they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might
be sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We
are on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ
any new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict
discipline and continual military drill are very important points,
specially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans
are employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily
expenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be
observed.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found
to be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,
and may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified
officers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.Meantime
I authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is
indispensable.I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,
and also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,
and that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed
for this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into
readiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable
in the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,
but the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is
always wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground
and coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is
also necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance
of the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are
very strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also
think that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half
stone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present
for such people.These and other improvements are also recommended
to the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for
higher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this
on my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest
pay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have
to do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test
would do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the
number here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in
all places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who
receive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be
raised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no
increase will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the
intermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated
in Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always
to the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the
case of women without children the matter is not quite so important,
and I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a
native proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing
to place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no
more slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with
free people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,
but those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some
trade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It
is not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might
have undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case
very soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should
be paid to all that passes at Manaar.This has been confirmed again
by our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty
from the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done
by the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time
of the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be
awaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,
and in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether
it would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think
that this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously
recommend better supervision.It is unaccountable how so many of
these animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals
sent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,
only one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is
it to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large
number of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not
be looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants
kept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,
while two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than
120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,
although there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby
elephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as
has been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,
which would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,
but even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,
moreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then
a large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,
for I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others
who have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses
and in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must
be carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)
were absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the
way.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only
one cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They
are only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or
15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,
and it is very likely that those that are being transported get still
less, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How
little regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands
of Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,
when questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or
those who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and
inexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned
or even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's
interests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,
and fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the
death of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss
to the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were
held mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of
Mantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in
the stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have
more than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During
the dry season the animals must be distributed over the different
villages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be
taken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias
[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at
present, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should
be appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,
to supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,
and see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly
fed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by
buffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,
and in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise
the transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,
and he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies
for.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his
charge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to
the boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,
and he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them
to the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the
animals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see
that these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements
he could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is
all I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,
are mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the
sale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of
the Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard
to the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked
for pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be
made.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next
fishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard
to the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as
beacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with
the necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the
question as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account
of the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see
that it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure
that a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question
once more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may
be discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held
in the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His
blessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last
time, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account
of the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the
inhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks
about them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the
annexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw
about 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught
with nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly
good race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500
foals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be
large enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three
teams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four
horses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors
and courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible
alike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many
of which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost
useless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service
of the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle
horse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,
25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public
auction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,
as they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at
which the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,
but always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the
interest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further
recommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the
islands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,
where the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little
tamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this
stable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to
whom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is
moreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is
very unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island
Delft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now
found there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing
rapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of
two, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition
to the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed
to increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have
to derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,
but they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated
and must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of
water; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and
it would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and
Beschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;
Aripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks
are necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that
I would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit
the redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in
what way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the
different proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve
preference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,
as it would have to be two miles long.As to the other proposals,
such as that of making a fence of palmyra trees or thorns, or to
dig a moat, I think it would be labour in vain; but whatever is
done must be carried out without expense or trouble to the Company,
in compliance with the orders from the Supreme Government of India.The instructions with regard to the water tanks must be carried
out as far as possible.I agree with what is said here with regard to the public roads.That the elephant stalls and the churches should have been allowed
to fall into decay speaks badly for the way in which those concerned
have performed their duty; and it is a cause of dissatisfaction.The
orders for the stalls in Manaar must also be applied for here,
and repairs carried out as soon as possible.I have been informed
that there are many elephants scattered here and there far from each
other, while only one Vidana acts as chief overseer, so that he cannot
possibly attend to his duty properly.It has been observed that the
elephants should have more parias or men who provide their food.These
and other orders with regard to the animals should be carried out.No remarks are required with regard to this subject of thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Carret, and elephants' tusks.The General Paresse [80] has been held upon my orders on the last
of July.Three requests were made, two of which were so frivolous and
unimportant that I need not mention them here.The
third and more important one was that the duty on native cloth,
which at present is 25 per cent., might be reduced.It was agreed
that from the 31st December it would be only 20 per cent.I was in a
position to settle this matter at once, because orders had been already
received from Batavia that they could be reduced to 20 per cent.,
but no more.As shown in the annexed Memoir, the inhabitants are not
so badly off as they try to make us believe.The further instructions
in the annexed Memoir must be observed; and although I have verbally
ordered the Onderkoopman De Bitter to have the Pattangatyns appear
only twice instead of twelve times a year, as being an unbearable
inconvenience, the Dessave must see that this order is obeyed.He must
also make inquiries whether the work could be done by one Cannekappul,
and, if so, Jeronimus must be discharged.Conclusion.--The advice in this conclusion may be useful to Your
Honours.I confirm the list of members of the Political Council,
to whom the rule of this Commandement in the interest of the Company
is seriously recommended.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

a denomination of currency it came to represent only 48 stivers.Yet
to preserve a fictitious identity with the original rix-dollar, the
local mint turned out stivers of lower value, of which 60 were made
to correspond to 48 of the Dutch stivers.[38] In China a picol is equal to 133-1/3 lb.[39] Probably the Malay word bahar.The
word is also found spelt baar, plural baren, in the Dutch Records.A
baar is equal to 600 lb.[40] Florins, stivers, abassis.[41] These are now known as cheniyas.[42] Plural of onderkoopman.[45] Pardao, a popular name among the Portuguese for a gold and
afterwards for a silver coin.That here referred to was perhaps the
pagoda, which Valentyn makes equal to 6 guilders.[46] A copy of these is among the Archives in Colombo.[47] The Militia, composed of Vryburgers as officers, and townsmen

drawbridge built before the Castle, with a small water mill on one
side to keep the canals always full of sea water; and a miniature
model has already been made."[57] He died on December 15, 1691, on board the ship Drechterland on

destroyed or lost with the rest of the Jaffna records; and there is
no copy in the Archives at Colombo.But an older report of Commandeur
Blom dated 1690 will be translated for this series.[66] The figures are as given in the MS.It is difficult to reconcile
these equivalents with the rate of 3 guilders to the rix-dollar.The
denominations given under florins (guilders) are as follows:--16
abassis = 1 stiver; 20 stivers = 1 florin.[68] Hendrick Zwaardecroon.[71] A fanam, according to Valentyn's table, was equal to 5 stivers.[72] During the early years of the Dutch rule in Ceylon there was,

    Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:--
    "Woe to the wretch who fails to rear
    At this dread sign the ready spear!For, as the flames this symbol sear,
    His home, the refuge of his fear,
      A kindred fate shall know;
    Far o'er its roof the volumed flame
    Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,
    While maids and matrons on his name
    Shall call down wretchedness and shame,
      And infamy and woe."Then rose the cry of females, shrill
    As goshawk's whistle on the hill,
    Denouncing[187] misery and ill,
    Mingled with childhood's babbling trill
      Of curses stammer'd slow;
    Answering, with imprecation dread,
    "Sunk be his home in embers red!And cursed be the meanest shed
    That e'er shall hide the houseless head,
      We doom to want and woe!"A sharp and shrieking echo gave,
    Coir-Uriskin,[188] thy Goblin-cave!And the gray pass where birches wave
      On Beala-nam-bo.[189]

[186] Scorched; charred.[187] Upon the recreant who failed to respond to the "dread sign" of
the Fiery Cross.[188] A ravine of Benvenue supposed to be haunted by evil spirits.[189] The Pass of the Cattle, above Coir-Uriskin.Then deeper paused the priest anew,
    And hard his laboring breath he drew,
    While, with set teeth and clinched hand,
    And eyes that glow'd like fiery brand,
    He meditated curse more dread,
    And deadlier, on the clansman's head,
    Who, summon'd to his Chieftain's aid,
    The signal saw and disobeyed.The crosslet's points of sparkling wood
    He quenched among the bubbling blood,
    And, as again the sign he rear'd,
    Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:
    "When flits this Cross from man to man,
    Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,
    Burst be the ear that fails to heed!Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!May ravens tear the careless eyes,
    Wolves make the coward heart their prize!As sinks that blood stream in the earth,
    So may his heart's blood drench his hearth!As dies in hissing gore the spark,
    Quench thou his light, Destruction dark,
    And be the grace to him denied,
    Bought by this sign to all beside!"He ceased; no echo gave agen
    The murmur of the deep Amen.Then Roderick, with impatient look,
    From Brian's hand the symbol took:
    "Speed, Malise, speed!"he said, and gave
    The crosslet to his henchman brave."The muster-place be Lanrick mead[190]--
    Instant the time--speed, Malise, speed!"Like heath bird, when the hawks pursue,
    A barge across Loch Katrine flew;
    High stood the henchman on the prow;
    So rapidly the barge-men row,
    The bubbles, where they launch'd the boat,
    Were all unbroken and afloat,
    Dancing in foam and ripple still,
    When it had near'd the mainland hill;
    And from the silver beach's side
    Still was the prow three fathom wide,
    When lightly bounded to the land
    The messenger of blood and brand.[190] A meadow at the western end of Loch Vennachar.the dun deer's hide[191]
    On fleeter foot was never tied.such cause of haste
    Thine active sinews never braced.Bend 'gainst the steepy hill thy breast,
    Burst down like torrent from its crest;
    With short and springing footstep pass
    The trembling bog and false morass;
    Across the brook like roebuck bound,
    And thread the brake like questing[192] hound;
    The crag is high, the scaur is deep,
    Yet shrink not from the desperate leap:
    Parch'd are thy burning lips and brow,
    Yet by the fountain pause not now;
    Herald of battle, fate, and fear,
    Stretch onward in thy fleet career!The wounded hind thou track'st not now,
    Pursuest not maid through greenwood bough,
    Nor pliest thou now thy flying pace
    With rivals in the mountain race;
    But danger, death, and warrior deed
    Are in thy course--speed, Malise, speed![191] The shoes or buskins of the Highlanders were made of this hide.Fast as the fatal symbol flies,
    In arms the huts and hamlets rise;
    From winding glen, from upland brown,
    They pour'd each hardy tenant down.Nor slack'd the messenger his pace;
    He show'd the sign, he named the place,
    And, pressing forward like the wind,
    Left clamor and surprise behind.The fisherman forsook the strand,
    The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;
    With changed cheer,[193] the mower blithe
    Left in the half-cut swath the scythe;
    The herds without a keeper stray'd,
    The plow was in mid-furrow stayed,
    The falc'ner toss'd his hawk away,
    The hunter left the stag at bay;
    Prompt at the signal of alarms,
    Each son of Alpine rush'd to arms;
    So swept the tumult and affray
    Along the margin of Achray.that e'er
    Thy banks should echo sounds of fear!The rocks, the bosky[194] thickets, sleep
    So stilly on thy bosom deep,
    The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud,
    Seems for the scene too gayly loud.The lake is past,
    Duncraggan's[195] huts appear at last,
    And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen,
    Half hidden in the copse so green;
    There mayst thou rest, thy labor done,
    Their lord shall speed the signal on.--
    As stoops the hawk upon his prey,
    The henchman shot him down the way.--What woeful accents load the gale?A gallant hunter's sport is o'er,
    A valiant warrior fights no more.Who, in the battle or the chase,
    At Roderick's side shall fill his place!--
    Within the hall, where torch's ray
    Supplies the excluded beams of day,
    Lies Duncan on his lowly bier,
    And o'er him streams his widow's tear.His stripling son stands mournful by,
    His youngest weeps, but knows not why;
    The village maids and matrons round
    The dismal coronach[196] resound.[195] An estate between Lochs Achray and Vennachar.[196] The Scottish wail or song over the dead.He is gone on the mountain,
      He is lost to the forest,
    Like a summer-dried fountain,
      When our need was the sorest.The font, reappearing,
      From the raindrops shall borrow,
    But to us comes no cheering,
      To Duncan no morrow!The hand of the reaper
      Takes the ears that are hoary,
    But the voice of the weeper
      Wails manhood in glory.The autumn winds rushing
      Waft the leaves that are searest,
    But our flower was in flushing,[197]
      When blighting was nearest.Fleet foot on the correi,[198]
      Sage counsel in cumber,[199]
    Red hand in the foray,
      How sound is thy slumber!Like the dew on the mountain,
      Like the foam on the river,
    Like the bubble on the fountain,
      Thou art gone, and forever![198] The side of a hill which the game usually frequents.See Stumah,[200] who, the bier beside,
    His master's corpse with wonder eyed,
    Poor Stumah!whom his least halloo
    Could send like lightning o'er the dew,
    Bristles his crest, and points his ears,
    As if some stranger step he hears.'Tis not a mourner's muffled tread,
    Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead,
    But headlong haste, or deadly fear,
    Urge the precipitate career.All stand aghast:--unheeding all,
    The henchman bursts into the hall;
    Before the dead man's bier he stood;
    Held forth the Cross besmear'd with blood:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead;
    Speed forth the signal!Angus, the heir of Duncan's line,
    Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign.In haste the stripling to his side
    His father's dirk and broadsword tied;
    But when he saw his mother's eye
    Watch him in speechless agony,
    Back to her open'd arms he flew,
    Press'd on her lips a fond adieu--
    "Alas!"she sobb'd,--"and yet, begone,
    And speed thee forth, like Duncan's son!"One look he cast upon the bier,
    Dash'd from his eye the gathering tear,
    Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast,
    And toss'd aloft his bonnet crest,
    Then, like the high-bred colt, when, freed,
    First he essays his fire and speed,
    He vanish'd, and o'er moor and moss
    Sped forward with the Fiery Cross.Suspended was the widow's tear,
    While yet his footsteps she could hear;
    And when she mark'd the henchman's eye
    Wet with unwonted sympathy,
    "Kinsman," she said, "his race is run,
    That should have sped thine errand on;
    The oak has fall'n,--the sapling bough
    Is all Duncraggan's shelter now.Yet trust I well, his duty done,
    The orphan's God will guard my son.--
    And you, in many a danger true,
    At Duncan's hest[201] your blades that drew,
    To arms, and guard that orphan's head!Let babes and women wail the dead."Then weapon clang, and martial call,
    Resounded through the funeral hall,
    While from the walls the attendant band
    Snatch'd sword and targe, with hurried hand;
    And short and flitting energy
    Glanced from the mourner's sunken eye,
    As if the sounds to warrior dear
    Might rouse her Duncan from his bier.But faded soon that borrow'd force;
    Grief claim'd his right, and tears their course.Benledi saw the Cross of Fire,
    It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.[202]
    O'er dale and hill the summons flew,
    Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;
    The tear that gather'd in his eye
    He left the mountain breeze to dry;
    Until, where Teith's young waters roll,
    Betwixt him and a wooded knoll,
    That graced the sable strath with green,
    The chapel of St.Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge,
    But Angus paused not on the edge;
    Though the dark waves danced dizzily,
    Though reel'd his sympathetic eye,
    He dash'd amid the torrent's roar:
    His right hand high the crosslet bore,
    His left the poleax grasp'd, to guide
    And stay his footing in the tide.He stumbled twice--the foam splash'd high,
    With hoarser swell the stream raced by;
    And had he fall'n,--forever there,
    Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!But still, as if in parting life,
    Firmer he grasp'd the Cross of strife,
    Until the opposing bank he gain'd,
    And up the chapel pathway strain'd.[202] The valley in which Loch Lubnaig lies.A blithesome rout, that morning tide,[203]
    Had sought the chapel of St.Her troth Tombea's[204] Mary gave
    To Norman, heir of Armandave,[205]
    And, issuing from the Gothic arch,
    The bridal[206] now resumed their march.In rude, but glad procession, came
    Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame;
    And plaided youth, with jest and jeer,
    Which snooded maiden would not hear;
    And children, that, unwitting[207] why,
    Lent the gay shout their shrilly cry;
    And minstrels, that in measures vied
    Before the young and bonny bride,
    Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose
    The tear and blush of morning rose.With virgin step, and bashful hand,
    She held the kerchief's snowy band;
    The gallant bridegroom, by her side,
    Beheld his prize with victor's pride,
    And the glad mother in her ear
    Was closely whispering word of cheer.[204] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[205] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[206] Those composing the bridal procession.Haste in his hurried accent lies,
    And grief is swimming in his eyes.All dripping from the recent flood,
    Panting and travel-soil'd he stood,
    The fatal sign of fire and sword
    Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead--
    Speed forth the signal!And must he change so soon the hand,
    Just link'd to his by holy band,
    For the fell Cross of blood and brand?And must the day, so blithe that rose,
    And promised rapture in the close,
    Before its setting hour, divide
    The bridegroom from the plighted bride?Clan-Alpine's cause, her Chieftain's trust,
    Her summons dread, brook no delay;
    Stretch to the race--away!Yet slow he laid his plaid aside,
    And, lingering, eyed his lovely bride,
    Until he saw the starting tear
    Speak woe he might not stop to cheer;
    Then, trusting not a second look,
    In haste he sped him up the brook,
    Nor backward glanced, till on the heath
    Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith.--What in the racer's bosom stirr'd?The sickening pang of hope deferr'd,
    And memory, with a torturing train
    Of all his morning visions vain.Mingled with love's impatience, came
    The manly thirst for martial fame;
    The stormy joy of mountaineers,
    Ere yet they rush upon the spears;
    And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,
    And hope, from well-fought field returning,
    With war's red honors on his crest,
    To clasp his Mary to his breast.Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,
    Like fire from flint he glanced away,
    While high resolve, and feeling strong,
    Burst into voluntary song.The heath this night must be my bed,
    The bracken curtain for my head,
    My lullaby the warder's tread,
        Far, far from love and thee, Mary;
    To-morrow eve, more stilly laid,
    My couch may be my bloody plaid,
    My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid!I may not, dare not, fancy now
    The grief that clouds thy lovely brow;
    I dare not think upon thy vow,
        And all it promised me, Mary.No fond regret must Norman know;
    When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe,
    His heart must be like bended bow,
        His foot like arrow free, Mary.A time will come with feeling fraught,
    For, if I fall in battle fought,
    Thy hapless lover's dying thought
        Shall be a thought of thee, Mary.And if return'd from conquer'd foes,
    How blithely will the evening close,
    How sweet the linnet sing repose,
        To my young bride and me, Mary!Not faster o'er thy heathery braes,
    Balquhidder, speeds the midnight blaze,[208]
    Rushing, in conflagration strong,
    Thy deep ravines and dells along,
    Wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow,
    And reddening the dark lakes below;
    Nor faster speeds it, nor so far,
    As o'er thy heaths the voice of war.The signal roused to martial coil[209]
    The sullen margin of Loch Voil,
    Waked still Loch Doine, and to the source
    Alarm'd, Balvaig, thy swampy course;
    Thence southward turn'd its rapid road
    Adown Strath-Gartney's valley broad,
    Till rose in arms each man might claim
    A portion in Clan-Alpine's name,
    From the gray sire, whose trembling hand
    Could hardly buckle on his brand,
    To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow
    Were yet scarce terror to the crow.Each valley, each sequester'd glen,
    Muster'd its little horde of men,
    That met as torrents from the height
    In Highland dales their streams unite,
    Still gathering, as they pour along,
    A voice more loud, a tide more strong,
    Till at the rendezvous they stood
    By hundreds prompt for blows and blood;
    Each train'd to arms since life began,
    Owning no tie but to his clan,
    No oath, but by his Chieftain's hand,
    No law, but Roderick Dhu's command.[208] Blaze of the heather, which is often set on fire by the shepherds
to facilitate a growth of young herbage for the sheep.That summer morn had Roderick Dhu
    Survey'd the skirts of Benvenue,
    And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,
    To view the frontiers of Menteith.All backward came with news of truce;
    Still lay each martial Graeme[210] and Bruce,[211]
    In Rednock[212] courts no horsemen wait,
    No banner waved on Cardross[213] gate,
    On Duchray's[214] towers no beacon shone,
    Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;
    All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye why
    The Chieftain, with such anxious eye,
    Ere to the muster he repair,
    This western frontier scann'd with care?--
    In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,
    A fair, though cruel, pledge was left;
    For Douglas, to his promise true,
    That morning from the isle withdrew,
    And in a deep sequester'd dell
    Had sought a low and lonely cell.By many a bard, in Celtic tongue,
    Has Coir-nan-Uriskin[215] been sung;
    A softer name the Saxons gave,
    And called the grot the Goblin-cave.[210] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[211] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[212] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[213] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[214] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.It was a wild and strange retreat,
    As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.The dell, upon the mountain's crest,
    Yawn'd like a gash on warrior's breast;
    Its trench had stayed full many a rock,
    Hurl'd by primeval earthquake shock
    From Benvenue's gray summit wild,
    And here, in random ruin piled,
    They frown'd incumbent o'er the spot,
    And form'd the rugged silvan grot.The oak and birch, with mingled shade,
    At noontide there a twilight made,
    Unless when short and sudden shone
    Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,
    With such a glimpse as prophet's eye
    Gains on thy depth, Futurity.No murmur waked the solemn still,[216]
    Save tinkling of a fountain rill;
    But when the wind chafed with the lake,
    A sullen sound would upward break,
    With dashing hollow voice, that spoke
    The incessant war of wave and rock.Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,
    Seem'd nodding o'er the cavern gray.From such a den the wolf had sprung,
    In such the wild-cat leaves her young;
    Yet Douglas and his daughter fair
    Sought for a space their safety there.Gray Superstition's whisper dread
    Debarr'd the spot to vulgar tread;
    For there, she said, did fays resort,
    And satyrs[217] hold their silvan court,
    By moonlight tread their mystic maze,
    And blast the rash beholder's gaze.[217] Silvan deities of Greek mythology, with head and body of a man
and legs of a goat.Now eve, with western shadows long,
    Floated on Katrine bright and strong,
    When Roderick, with a chosen few,
    Repass'd the heights of Benvenue.Above the Goblin-cave they go,
    Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo:
    The prompt retainers speed before,
    To launch the shallop from the shore,
    For 'cross Loch Katrine lies his way
    To view the passes of Achray,
    And place his clansmen in array.Yet lags the Chief in musing mind,
    Unwonted sight, his men behind.A single page, to bear his sword,
    Alone attended on his lord;
    The rest their way through thickets break,
    And soon await him by the lake.It was a fair and gallant sight,
    To view them from the neighboring height,
    By the low-level'd sunbeam's light!For strength and stature, from the clan
    Each warrior was a chosen man,
    As even afar might well be seen,
    By their proud step and martial mien.Their feathers dance, their tartans float,
    Their targets gleam, as by the boat
    A wild and warlike group they stand,
    That well became such mountain strand.Their Chief, with step reluctant, still
    Was lingering on the craggy hill,
    Hard by where turn'd apart the road
    To Douglas's obscure abode.It was but with that dawning morn,
    That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn
    To drown his love in war's wild roar,
    Nor think of Ellen Douglas more;
    But he who stems[218] a stream with sand,
    And fetters flame with flaxen band,
    Has yet a harder task to prove--
    By firm resolve to conquer love!Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost,
    Still hovering near his treasure lost;
    For though his haughty heart deny
    A parting meeting to his eye,
    Still fondly strains his anxious ear,
    The accents of her voice to hear,
    And inly did he curse the breeze
    That waked to sound the rustling trees.It is the harp of Allan-Bane,
    That wakes its measure slow and high,
    Attuned to sacred minstrelsy.'Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings._Ave Maria!_[219] maiden mild!Thou canst hear though from the wild,
      Thou canst save amid despair.Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,
      Though banish'd, outcast, and reviled--
    Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ undefiled!The flinty couch we now must share
    Shall seem with down of eider[220] piled,
      If thy protection hover there.The murky cavern's heavy air
      Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;
    Then, Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ stainless styled!Foul demons of the earth and air,
    From this their wonted haunt exiled,
      Shall flee before thy presence fair.We bow us to our lot of care,
      Beneath thy guidance reconciled;
    Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer!_Ave Maria!_

[219] Hail, Mary!The beginning of the Roman Catholic prayer to the
Virgin Mary.[220] "Down of eider," i.e., the soft breast feathers of the eider duck.Died on the harp the closing hymn.--
    Unmoved in attitude and limb,
    As list'ning still, Clan-Alpine's lord
    Stood leaning on his heavy sword,
    Until the page, with humble sign,
    Twice pointed to the sun's decline.Then while his plaid he round him cast,
    "It is the last time--'tis the last,"
    He mutter'd thrice,--"the last time e'er
    That angel voice shall Roderick hear!"It was a goading thought--his stride
    Hied hastier down the mountain side;
    Sullen he flung him in the boat,
    And instant 'cross the lake it shot.They landed in that silvery bay,
    And eastward held their hasty way,
    Till, with the latest beams of light,
    The band arrived on Lanrick height,
    Where muster'd, in the vale below,
    Clan-Alpine's men in martial show.A various scene the clansmen made;
    Some sate, some stood, some slowly stray'd;
    But most, with mantles folded round,
    Were couch'd to rest upon the ground,
    Scarce to be known by curious eye,
    From the deep heather where they lie,
    So well was match'd the tartan screen
    With heath bell dark and brackens green;
    Unless where, here and there, a blade,
    Or lance's point, a glimmer made,
    Like glowworm twinkling through the shade.But when, advancing through the gloom,
    They saw the Chieftain's eagle plume,
    Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide,
    Shook the steep mountain's steady side.Thrice it arose, and lake and fell
    Three times return'd the martial yell;
    It died upon Bochastle's plain,
    And Silence claim'd her evening reign."The rose is fairest when 'tis budding new,
      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears;
    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,
      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.O wilding[221] rose, whom fancy thus endears,
      I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave,
    Emblem of hope and love through future years!"--
      Thus spoke young Norman, heir of Armandave,
    What time the sun arose on Vennachar's broad wave.Such fond conceit, half said, half sung,
    Love prompted to the bridegroom's tongue,
    All while he stripp'd the wild-rose spray.His ax and bow beside him lay,
    For on a pass 'twixt lake and wood,
    A wakeful sentinel he stood.on the rock a footstep rung,
    And instant to his arms he sprung."Stand, or thou diest!--What, Malise?--soon
    Art thou return'd from Braes of Doune.By thy keen step and glance I know,
    Thou bring'st us tidings of the foe."--
    (For while the Fiery Cross hied on,
    On distant scout had Malise gone.)the henchman said.--
    "Apart, in yonder misty glade;
    To his lone couch I'll be your guide."--
    Then call'd a slumberer by his side,
    And stirr'd him with his slacken'd bow--
    "Up, up, Glentarkin!We seek the Chieftain; on the track,
    Keep eagle watch till I come back."Together up the pass they sped:
    "What of the foemen?"Norman said.--
    "Varying reports from near and far;
    This certain,--that a band of war
    Has for two days been ready boune,[222]
    At prompt command, to march from Doune;
    King James, the while, with princely powers,
    Holds revelry in Stirling towers.Soon will this dark and gathering cloud
    Speak on our glens in thunder loud.Inured to bide such bitter bout,
    The warrior's plaid may bear it out;[223]
    But, Norman, how wilt thou provide
    A shelter for thy bonny bride?"know ye not that Roderick's care
    To the lone isle hath caused repair
    Each maid and matron of the clan,
    And every child and aged man
    Unfit for arms; and given his charge,[224]
    Nor skiff nor shallop, boat nor barge,
    Upon these lakes shall float at large,
    But all beside the islet moor,
    That such dear pledge may rest secure?"--

[222] "Boune" itself means "ready" in Scotch: hence its use here is
tautology.[223] "Inured to bide," etc., i.e., accustomed to endure privations,
the warrior may withstand the coming storm."'Tis well advised--the Chieftain's plan
    Bespeaks the father of his clan.But wherefore sleeps Sir Roderick Dhu
    Apart from all his followers true?"--
    "It is, because last evening-tide
    Brian an augury hath tried,
    Of that dread kind which must not be
    Unless in dread extremity;
    The Taghairm[225] call'd; by which, afar,
    Our sires foresaw the events of war.Duncraggan's milk-white bull they slew."The choicest of the prey we had,
    When swept our merry men Gallangad.[226]
    His hide was snow, his horns were dark,
    His red eye glow'd like fiery spark;
    So fierce, so tameless, and so fleet,
    Sore did he cumber our retreat,
    And kept our stoutest kernes[227] in awe,
    Even at the pass of Beal'maha.But steep and flinty was the road,
    And sharp the hurrying pikeman's goad,
    And when we came to Dennan's Row,
    A child might scathless[228] stroke his brow."[225] An old Highland mode of "reading the future.""A person was
wrapped up in the skin of a newly slain bullock, and deposited beside a
waterfall, or at the bottom of a precipice, or in some other strange,
wild, and unusual situation.In this situation he revolved in his
mind the question proposed, and whatever was impressed upon him by
his exalted imagination passed for the inspiration of the disembodied
spirits who haunt the desolate recesses."--_Scott._

[226] South of Loch Lomond."That bull was slain: his reeking hide
    They stretch'd the cataract beside,
    Whose waters their wild tumult toss
    Adown the black and craggy boss
    Of that huge cliff, whose ample verge
    Tradition calls the Hero's Targe.Couch'd on a shelve beneath its brink,
    Close where the thundering torrents sink,
    Rocking beneath their headlong sway,
    And drizzled by the ceaseless spray,
    Midst groan of rock, and roar of stream,
    The wizard waits prophetic dream.Nor distant rests the Chief;--but hush!See, gliding slow through mist and bush,
    The Hermit gains yon rock, and stands
    To gaze upon our slumbering bands.Seems he not, Malise, like a ghost,
    That hovers o'er a slaughter'd host?Or raven on the blasted oak,
    That, watching while the deer is broke,[229]
    His morsel claims with sullen croak?"to other than to me,
    Thy words were evil augury;
    But still I hold Sir Roderick's blade
    Clan-Alpine's omen and her aid,
    Not aught that, glean'd from heaven or hell,
    Yon fiend-begotten monk can tell.The Chieftain joins him, see--and now,
    Together they descend the brow."And, as they came, with Alpine's lord
    The Hermit Monk held solemn word:--
    "Roderick!it is a fearful strife,
    For man endowed with mortal life,
    Whose shroud of sentient clay can still
    Feel feverish pang and fainting chill,
    Whose eye can stare in stony trance,
    Whose hair can rouse like warrior's lance,--
    'Tis hard for such to view, unfurl'd,
    The curtain of the future world.Yet, witness every quaking limb,
    My sunken pulse, my eyeballs dim,
    My soul with harrowing anguish torn,
    This for my Chieftain have I borne!--
    The shapes that sought my fearful couch,
    A human tongue may ne'er avouch;
    No mortal man,--save he, who, bred
    Between the living and the dead,
    Is gifted beyond nature's law,--
    Had e'er survived to say he saw.At length the fateful answer came,
    In characters of living flame!Not spoke in word, nor blazed[230] in scroll,
    But borne and branded on my soul;--
    WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN'S LIFE,
    THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE."--

[230] Emblazoned."Thanks, Brian, for thy zeal and care!Good is thine augury, and fair.Clan-Alpine ne'er in battle stood,
    But first our broadswords tasted blood.A surer victim still I know,
    Self-offer'd to the auspicious blow:
    A spy has sought my land this morn,--
    No eve shall witness his return!My followers guard each pass's mouth,
    To east, to westward, and to south;
    Red Murdoch, bribed to be his guide,
    Has charge to lead his steps aside,
    Till, in deep path or dingle brown,
    He light on those shall bring him down.--But see, who comes his news to show!"At Doune, o'er many a spear and glaive[231]
    Two Barons proud their banners wave.I saw the Moray's silver star,
    And mark'd the sable pale[232] of Mar."--
    "By Alpine's soul, high tidings those!--"To-morrow's noon
    Will see them here for battle boune."--
    "Then shall it see a meeting stern!--
    But, for the place--say, couldst thou learn
    Naught of the friendly clans of Earn?[233]
    Strengthened by them, we well might bide
    The battle on Benledi's side.Clan-Alpine's men
    Shall man the Trosachs' shaggy glen;
    Within Loch Katrine's gorge we'll fight,
    All in our maids' and matrons' sight,
    Each for his hearth and household fire,
    Father for child, and son for sire,
    Lover for maid beloved!--But why--
    Is it the breeze affects mine eye?Or dost thou come, ill-omened tear!sooner may the Saxon lance
    Unfix Benledi from his stance,[234]
    Than doubt or terror can pierce through
    The unyielding heart of Roderick Dhu!'Tis stubborn as his trusty targe.Each to his post--all know their charge."The pibroch sounds, the bands advance,
    The broadswords gleam, the banners dance,
    Obedient to the Chieftain's glance.--I turn me from the martial roar,
    And seek Coir-Uriskin once more.[232] Black band in the coat of arms of the Earls of Mar.Where is the Douglas?--he is gone;
    And Ellen sits on the gray stone
    Fast by the cave, and makes her moan;
    While vainly Allan's words of cheer
    Are pour'd on her unheeding ear.--
    "He will return--Dear lady, trust!--
    With joy return;--he will--he must.Well was it time to seek, afar,
    Some refuge from impending war,
    When e'en Clan-Alpine's rugged swarm
    Are cow'd by the approaching storm.I saw their boats, with many a light,
    Floating the livelong yesternight,
    Shifting like flashes darted forth
    By the red streamers of the north;[235]
    I mark'd at morn how close they ride,
    Thick moor'd by the lone islet's side,
    Like wild ducks couching in the fen,
    When stoops the hawk upon the glen.Since this rude race dare not abide
    The peril on the mainland side,
    Shall not thy noble father's care
    Some safe retreat for thee prepare?"--

[235] "Red streamers," etc., i.e., the aurora borealis.Pretext so kind
    My wakeful terrors could not blind.When in such tender tone, yet grave,
    Douglas a parting blessing gave,
    The tear that glisten'd in his eye
    Drown'd not his purpose fix'd and high.My soul, though feminine and weak,
    Can image his; e'en as the lake,
    Itself disturb'd by slightest stroke,
    Reflects the invulnerable rock.He hears report of battle rife,
    He deems himself the cause of strife.I saw him redden, when the theme
    Turn'd, Allan, on thine idle dream
    Of Malcolm Graeme in fetters bound,
    Which I, thou saidst, about him wound.Think'st thou he trow'd[236] thine omen aught?'twas apprehensive thought
    For the kind youth,--for Roderick too--
    (Let me be just) that friend so true;
    In danger both, and in our cause!Minstrel, the Douglas dare not pause.Why else that solemn warning given,
    'If not on earth, we meet in heaven?'Why else, to Cambus-kenneth's fane,[237]
    If eve return him not again,
    Am I to hie, and make me known?he goes to Scotland's throne,
    Buys his friend's safety with his own;
    He goes to do--what I had done,
    Had Douglas' daughter been his son!"This abbey is not far from Stirling."Nay, lovely Ellen!--dearest, nay!If aught should his return delay,
    He only named yon holy fane
    As fitting place to meet again.Be sure he's safe; and for the Graeme,--
    Heaven's blessing on his gallant name!--
    My vision'd sight may yet prove true,
    Nor bode[238] of ill to him or you.When did my gifted[239] dream beguile?[240]
    Think of the stranger at the isle,
    And think upon the harpings slow,
    That presaged this approaching woe!Sooth was my prophecy of fear;
    Believe it when it augurs cheer.Ill luck still haunts a fairy grot.Of such a wondrous tale I know--
    Dear lady, change that look of woe,
    My harp was wont thy grief to cheer.""Well, be it as thou wilt; I hear,
    But cannot stop the bursting tear."The Minstrel tried his simple art,
    But distant far was Ellen's heart._Alice Brand._

    Merry it is in the good greenwood,
      When the mavis[241] and merle[242] are singing,
    When the deer sweeps by, and the hounds are in cry,
      And the hunter's horn is ringing."O Alice Brand, my native land
      Is lost for love of you;
    And we must hold by wood and wold,[243]
      As outlaws wont to do."O Alice, 'twas all for thy locks so bright,
      And 'twas all for thine eyes so blue,
    That on the night of our luckless flight,
      Thy brother bold I slew."Now must I teach to hew the beech
      The hand that held the glaive,
    For leaves to spread our lowly bed,
      And stakes to fence our cave."And for vest of pall,[244] thy finger small,
      That wont on harp to stray,
    A cloak must shear from the slaughter'd deer,
      To keep the cold away."if my brother died,
      'Twas but a fatal chance;
    For darkling[245] was the battle tried,
      And fortune sped the lance."If pall and vair[246] no more I wear,
      Nor thou the crimson sheen,
    As warm, we'll say, is the russet[247] gray,
      As gay the forest-green.[248]

    "And, Richard, if our lot be hard,
      And lost thy native land,
    Still Alice has her own Richard,
      And he his Alice Brand."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      So blithe Lady Alice is singing;
    On the beech's pride, and oak's brown side,
      Lord Richard's ax is ringing.Up spoke the moody Elfin King,
      Who won'd[249] within the hill,--
    Like wind in the porch of a ruin'd church,
      His voice was ghostly shrill."Why sounds yon stroke on beech and oak,
      Our moonlight circle's screen?Or who comes here to chase the deer,
      Beloved of our Elfin Queen?Or who may dare on wold to wear
      The fairies' fatal green!to yon mortal hie,
      For thou wert christen'd man;
    For cross or sign thou wilt not fly,
      For mutter'd word or ban."Lay on him the curse of the wither'd heart,
      The curse of the sleepless eye;
    Till he wish and pray that his life would part,
      Nor yet find leave to die."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      Though the birds have still'd their singing!The evening blaze doth Alice raise,
      And Richard is fagots bringing.Up Urgan starts, that hideous dwarf,
      Before Lord Richard stands,
    And, as he cross'd and bless'd himself,
    "I fear not sign," quoth the grisly elf,
      "That is made with bloody hands."But out then spoke she, Alice Brand,
      That woman void of fear,--
    "And if there's blood upon his hand,
      'Tis but the blood of deer."--

    "Now loud thou liest, thou bold of mood!It cleaves unto his hand,
    The stain of thine own kindly[250] blood,
      The blood of Ethert Brand."Then forward stepp'd she, Alice Brand,
      And made the holy sign,--
    "And if there's blood on Richard's hand,
      A spotless hand is mine."And I conjure thee, demon elf,
      By Him whom demons fear,
    To show us whence thou art thyself,
      And what thine errand here?""'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in Fairyland,
      When fairy birds are singing,
    When the court doth ride by their monarch's side,
      With bit and bridle ringing:

    "And gayly shines the Fairyland--
      But all is glistening show,
    Like the idle gleam that December's beam
      Can dart on ice and snow."And fading, like that varied gleam,
      Is our inconstant shape,
    Who now like knight and lady seem,
      And now like dwarf and ape."It was between the night and day,
      When the Fairy King has power,
    That I sunk down in a sinful fray,
    And, 'twixt life and death, was snatched away
      To the joyless Elfin bower."But wist[251] I of a woman bold,
      Who thrice my brow durst sign,
    I might regain my mortal mold,
      As fair a form as thine."She cross'd him once--she cross'd him twice--
      That lady was so brave;
    The fouler grew his goblin hue,
      The darker grew the cave.She cross'd him thrice, that lady bold;
      He rose beneath her hand
    The fairest knight on Scottish mold,
      Her brother, Ethert Brand!Merry it is in good greenwood,
      When the mavis and merle are singing,
    But merrier were they in Dunfermline[252] gray,
      When all the bells were ringing.[252] A town in Fifeshire, thirteen miles northwest of Edinburgh, the
residence of the early Scottish kings.Its Abbey of the Gray Friars was
the royal burial place.Just as the minstrel sounds were stayed,
    A stranger climb'd the steepy glade;
    His martial step, his stately mien,
    His hunting suit of Lincoln green,
    His eagle glance, remembrance claims--
    'Tis Snowdoun's Knight, 'tis James Fitz-James.Ellen beheld as in a dream,
    Then, starting, scarce suppress'd a scream:
    "O stranger!in such hour of fear,
    What evil hap has brought thee here?"--
    "An evil hap how can it be,
    That bids me look again on thee?By promise bound, my former guide
    Met me betimes this morning tide,
    And marshal'd, over bank and bourne,[253]
    The happy path of my return."--
    "The happy path!--what!said he naught
    Of war, of battle to be fought,
    Of guarded pass?"Nor saw I aught could augur scathe."[254]--
    "Oh haste thee, Allan, to the kern,[255]
    --Yonder his tartans I discern;
    Learn thou his purpose, and conjure
    That he will guide the stranger sure!--
    What prompted thee, unhappy man?The meanest serf in Roderick's clan
    Had not been bribed by love or fear,
    Unknown to him to guide thee here."Referring to the treacherous guide, Red Murdoch
(see Stanza VII."Sweet Ellen, dear my life must be,
    Since it is worthy care from thee;
    Yet life I hold but idle breath,
    When love or honor's weigh'd with death.Then let me profit by my chance,
    And speak my purpose bold at once.I come to bear thee from a wild,
    Where ne'er before such blossom smiled;
    By this soft hand to lead thee far
    From frantic scenes of feud and war.Near Bochastle my horses wait;
    They bear us soon to Stirling gate.I'll place thee in a lovely bower,
    I'll guard thee like a tender flower"--
    "Oh!'twere female art,
    To say I do not read thy heart;
    Too much, before, my selfish ear
    Was idly soothed my praise to hear.That fatal bait hath lured thee back,
    In deathful hour, o'er dangerous track;
    And how, oh how, can I atone
    The wreck my vanity brought on!--
    One way remains--I'll tell him all--
    Yes!struggling bosom, forth it shall!Thou, whose light folly bears the blame
    Buy thine own pardon with thy shame!But first--my father is a man
    Outlaw'd and exiled, under ban;
    The price of blood is on his head,
    With me 'twere infamy to wed.--
    Still wouldst thou speak?--then hear the truth!Fitz-James, there is a noble youth,--
    If yet he is!--exposed for me
    And mine to dread extremity[256]--
    Thou hast the secret of my heart;
    Forgive, be generous, and depart!"Fitz-James knew every wily train[257]
    A lady's fickle heart to gain;
    But here he knew and felt them vain.There shot no glance from Ellen's eye,
    To give her steadfast speech the lie;
    In maiden confidence she stood,
    Though mantled in her cheek the blood,
    And told her love with such a sigh
    Of deep and hopeless agony,
    As[258] death had seal'd her Malcolm's doom,
    And she sat sorrowing on his tomb.Hope vanish'd from Fitz-James's eye,
    But not with hope fled sympathy.He proffer'd to attend her side,
    As brother would a sister guide.--
    "Oh!little know'st thou Roderick's heart!Oh haste thee, and from Allan learn,
    If thou mayst trust yon wily kern."With hand upon his forehead laid,
    The conflict of his mind to shade,
    A parting step or two he made;
    Then, as some thought had cross'd his brain,
    He paused, and turn'd, and came again."Hear, lady, yet, a parting word!--
    It chanced in fight that my poor sword
    Preserved the life of Scotland's lord.This ring the grateful Monarch gave,
    And bade, when I had boon to crave,
    To bring it back, and boldly claim
    The recompense that I would name.Ellen, I am no courtly lord,
    But one who lives by lance and sword,
    Whose castle is his helm and shield,
    His lordship the embattled field.What from a prince can I demand,
    Who neither reck[259] of state nor land?Ellen, thy hand--the ring is thine;
    Each guard and usher knows the sign.Seek thou the King without delay;
    This signet shall secure thy way;
    And claim thy suit, whate'er it be,
    As ransom of his pledge to me."He placed the golden circlet on,
    Paused--kiss'd her hand--and then was gone.The aged Minstrel stood aghast,
    So hastily Fitz-James shot past.He join'd his guide, and wending down
    The ridges of the mountain brown,
    Across the stream they took their way,
    That joins Loch Katrine to Achray.All in the Trosachs' glen was still,
    Noontide was sleeping on the hill:
    Sudden his guide whoop'd loud and high--
    "Murdoch!--
    He stammer'd forth--"I shout to scare
    Yon raven from his dainty fare."He look'd--he knew the raven's prey,
    His own brave steed:--"Ah!For thee--for me, perchance--'twere well
    We ne'er had seen the Trosachs' dell.--
    Murdoch, move first--but silently;
    Whistle or whoop, and thou shalt die!"Jealous and sullen, on they fared,
    Each silent, each upon his guard.Now wound the path its dizzy ledge
    Around a precipice's edge,
    When lo!a wasted female form,
    Blighted by wrath of sun and storm,
    In tatter'd weeds[260] and wild array,
    Stood on a cliff beside the way,
    And glancing round her restless eye,
    Upon the wood, the rock, the sky,
    Seem'd naught to mark, yet all to spy.Her brow was wreath'd with gaudy broom;
    With gesture wild she waved a plume
    Of feathers, which the eagles fling
    To crag and cliff from dusky wing;
    Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
    Where scarce was footing for the goat.The tartan plaid she first descried,
    And shriek'd till all the rocks replied;
    As loud she laugh'd when near they drew,
    For then the Lowland garb she knew;
    And then her hands she wildly wrung,
    And then she wept, and then she sung--
    She sung!--the voice, in better time,
    Perchance to harp or lute might chime;
    And now, though strain'd and roughen'd, still
    Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,
      They say my brain is warp'd[261] and wrung--
    I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
      I cannot pray in Highland tongue.But were I now where Allan[262] glides,
    Or heard my native Devan's[263] tides,
    So sweetly would I rest, and pray
    That Heaven would close my wintry day!'Twas thus my hair they bade me braid,
      They made me to the church repair;
    It was my bridal morn, they said,
      And my true love would meet me there.But woe betide the cruel guile,
    That drown'd in blood the morning smile![262] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.[263] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.She hovers o'er the hollow way,
    And flutters wide her mantle gray,
    As the lone heron spreads his wing,
    By twilight, o'er a haunted spring."--
    "'Tis Blanche of Devan," Murdoch said,
    "A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
    Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
    When Roderick foray'd Devan-side;
    The gay bridegroom resistance made,
    And felt our Chief's unconquer'd blade.I marvel she is now at large,
    But oft she'scapes from Maudlin's charge.--
    Hence, brain-sick fool!"--He raised his bow:--
    "Now, if thou strikest her but one blow,
    I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
    As ever peasant pitch'd a bar!"[264]--
    "Thanks, champion, thanks!"the maniac cried,
    And press'd her to Fitz-James's side."See the gray pennons I prepare,
    To seek my true love through the air!I will not lend that savage groom,
    To break his fall, one downy plume!No!--deep amid disjointed stones,
    The wolves shall batten[265] on his bones,
    And then shall his detested plaid,
    By bush and brier in mid air stayed,
    Wave forth a banner fair and free,
    Meet signal for their revelry."--

[264] "Pitching the bar" was a favorite athletic sport in Scotland."Hush thee, poor maiden, and be still!"thou look'st kindly, and I will.--
    Mine eye has dried and wasted been,
    But still it loves the Lincoln green;
    And, though mine ear is all unstrung,
    Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue."For oh my sweet William was forester true,
      He stole poor Blanche's heart away!His coat it was all of the greenwood hue,
      And so blithely he trill'd the Lowland lay!"It was not that I meant to tell...
    But thou art wise, and guessest well."Then, in a low and broken tone,
    And hurried note, the song went on.Still on the Clansman, fearfully,
    She fixed her apprehensive eye;
    Then turn'd it on the Knight, and then
    Her look glanced wildly o'er the glen."The toils are pitch'd, and the stakes are set,
      Ever sing merrily, merrily;
    The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
      Hunters live so cheerily."It was a stag, a stag of ten,[266]
      Bearing its branches sturdily;
    He came stately down the glen,
      Ever sing hardily, hardily."It was there he met with a wounded doe,
      She was bleeding deathfully;
    She warn'd him of the toils below,
      Oh, so faithfully, faithfully!"He had an eye, and he could heed,
      Ever sing warily, warily;
    He had a foot, and he could speed--
      Hunters watch so narrowly."[267]

[266] Having antlers with ten branches.[267] "The hunters are Clan-Alpine's men; the stag of ten is
Fitz-James; the wounded doe is herself!"Fitz-James's mind was passion-toss'd,
    When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
    But Murdoch's shout suspicion wrought,
    And Blanche's song conviction brought.--
    Not like a stag that spies the snare,
    But lion of the hunt aware,
    He waved at once his blade on high,
    "Disclose thy treachery, or die!"Forth at full speed the Clansman flew,
    But in his race his bow he drew.The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
    And thrill'd in Blanche's faded breast.--
    Murdoch of Alpine!prove thy speed,
    For ne'er had Alpine's son such need!With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
    The fierce avenger is behind!Fate judges of the rapid strife--
    The forfeit[268] death--the prize is life!Thy kindred ambush lies before,
    Close couch'd upon the heathery moor;
    Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be--
    Thine ambush'd kin thou ne'er shalt see,
    The fiery Saxon gains on thee!--Resistless speeds the deadly thrust,
    As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
    With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain,
    Ere he can win his blade again.Bent o'er the fall'n, with falcon eye,
    He grimly smiled to see him die;
    Then slower wended back his way,
    Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.She sate beneath the birchen tree,
    Her elbow resting on her knee;
    She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
    And gazed on it, and feebly laugh'd;
    Her wreath of broom and feathers gray,
    Daggled[269] with blood, beside her lay.The Knight to stanch the life-stream tried,--
    "Stranger, it is in vain!""This hour of death has given me more
    Of reason's power than years before;
    For, as these ebbing veins decay,
    My frenzied visions fade away.A helpless injured wretch I die,
    And something tells me in thine eye,
    That thou wert mine avenger born.--
    Seest thou this tress?--Oh!still I've worn
    This little tress of yellow hair,
    Through danger, frenzy, and despair!It once was bright and clear as thine,
    But blood and tears have dimm'd its shine.I will not tell thee when 'twas shred,
    Nor from what guiltless victim's head--
    My brain would turn!--but it shall wave
    Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
    Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
    And thou wilt bring it me again.--
    I waver still.--O God!more bright
    Let reason beam her parting light!--
    Oh!by thy knighthood's honor'd sign,
    And for thy life preserved by mine,
    When thou shalt see a darksome man,
    Who boasts him Chief of Alpine's Clan,
    With tartans broad, and shadowy plume,
    And hand of blood, and brow of gloom,
    Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
    And wreak[270] poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!They watch for thee by pass and fell...
    Avoid the path... O God!...A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James;
    Fast pour'd his eyes at pity's claims;
    And now with mingled grief and ire,
    He saw the murder'd maid expire."God, in my need, be my relief,
    As I wreak this on yonder Chief!"A lock from Blanche's tresses fair
    He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
    The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
    And placed it on his bonnet-side:
    "By Him whose word is truth!I swear,
    No other favor will I wear,
    Till this sad token I imbrue
    In the best blood of Roderick Dhu.The chase is up,--but they shall know,
    The stag at bay's a dangerous foe."Barr'd from the known but guarded way,
    Through copse and cliffs Fitz-James must stray,
    And oft must change his desperate track,
    By stream and precipice turn'd back.Heartless, fatigued, and faint, at length,
    From lack of food and loss of strength,
    He couch'd him in a thicket hoar,
    And thought his toils and perils o'er:--
    "Of all my rash adventures past,
    This frantic feat must prove the last!Who e'er so mad but might have guess'd,
    That all this Highland hornet's nest
    Would muster up in swarms so soon
    As e'er they heard of bands[271] at Doune?Like bloodhounds now they search me out,--
    Hark, to the whistle and the shout!--
    If farther through the wilds I go,
    I only fall upon the foe:
    I'll couch me here till evening gray,
    Then darkling try my dangerous way."The shades of eve come slowly down,
    The woods are wrapt in deeper brown,
    The owl awakens from her dell,
    The fox is heard upon the fell;
    Enough remains of glimmering light
    To guide the wanderer's steps aright,
    Yet not enough from far to show
    His figure to the watchful foe.With cautious step, and ear awake,
    He climbs the crag and threads the brake;
    And not the summer solstice,[272] there,
    Temper'd the midnight mountain air,
    But every breeze, that swept the wold,
    Benumb'd his drenched limbs with cold.In dread, in danger, and alone,
    Famish'd and chill'd, through ways unknown,
    Tangled and steep, he journey'd on;
    Till, as a rock's huge point he turn'd,
    A watch fire close before him burn'd.Beside its embers red and clear,
    Bask'd, in his plaid, a mountaineer;
    And up he sprung with sword in hand,--
    "Thy name and purpose?--
    "Rest and a guide, and food and fire.My life's beset, my path is lost,
    The gale has chill'd my limbs with frost."--
    "Art thou a friend to Roderick?"--"No."--
    "Thou darest not call thyself a foe?"to him and all the band
    He brings to aid his murderous hand."--
    "Bold words!--but, though the beast of game
    The privilege of chase may claim,
    Though space and law the stag we lend,
    Ere hound we slip,[273] or bow we bend,
    Who ever reck'd, where, how, or when,
    The prowling fox was trapp'd or slain?Thus treacherous scouts,--yet sure they lie,
    Who say them earnest a secret spy!"--
    "They do, by Heaven!--Come Roderick Dhu,
    And of his clan the boldest two,
    And let me but till morning rest,
    I write the falsehood on their crest."--
    "If by the blaze I mark aright,
    Thou bear'st the belt and spur of Knight."--
    "Then by these tokens mayest thou know
    Each proud oppressor's mortal foe."--
    "Enough, enough;--sit down, and share
    A soldier's couch, a soldier's fare."He gave him of his Highland cheer,
    The harden'd flesh of mountain deer;
    Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
    And bade the Saxon share his plaid.He tended him like welcome guest,
    Then thus his farther speech address'd:--
    "Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
    A clansman born, a kinsman true;
    Each word against his honor spoke,
    Demands of me avenging stroke;
    Yet more, upon thy fate, 'tis said,
    A mighty augury[274] is laid.It rests with me to wind my horn,--
    Thou art with numbers overborne;
    It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
    Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand:
    But, not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
    Will I depart from honor's laws;
    To assail a wearied man were shame,
    And stranger is a holy name;
    Guidance and rest, and food and fire,
    In vain he never must require.Then rest thee here till dawn of day;
    Myself will guide thee on the way,
    O'er stock and stone, through watch and ward,
    Till past Clan-Alpine's utmost guard,
    As far as Coilantogle's ford;
    From thence thy warrant[275] is thy sword."--
    "I take thy courtesy, by Heaven,
    As freely as 'tis nobly given!"--
    "Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry
    Sings us the lake's wild lullaby."With that he shook the gather'd heath,
    And spread his plaid upon the wreath;
    And the brave foemen, side by side,
    Lay peaceful down, like brothers tried,
    And slept until the dawning beam
    Purpled the mountain and the stream.I.

    Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
        When first, by the bewilder'd pilgrim spied,
    It smiles upon the dreary brow of night,
        And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide,
    And lights the fearful path on mountain side;--
      Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
    Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
      Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star,
    Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.That early beam, so fair and sheen,
    Was twinkling through the hazel screen,
    When, rousing at its glimmer red,
    The warriors left their lowly bed,
    Look'd out upon the dappled sky,
    Mutter'd their soldier matins by,
    And then awaked their fire, to steal,[276]
    As short and rude, their soldier meal.That o'er, the Gael around him threw
    His graceful plaid of varied hue,
    And, true to promise, led the way,
    By thicket green and mountain gray.A wildering path!--they winded now
    Along the precipice's brow,
    Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
    The windings of the Forth and Teith,
    And all the vales beneath that lie,
    Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
    Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
    Gain'd not the length of horseman's lance
    'Twas oft so steep, the foot was fain
    Assistance from the hand to gain;
    So tangled oft, that, bursting through,
    Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
    That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
    It rivals all but Beauty's tear!At length they came where, stern and steep,
    The hill sinks down upon the deep.Here Vennachar in silver flows,
    There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
    Ever the hollow path twined on,
    Beneath steep bank and threatening stone;
    An hundred men might hold the post
    With hardihood against a host.The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
    Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak,
    With shingles[277] bare, and cliffs between,
    And patches bright of bracken green,
    And heather black, that waved so high,
    It held the copse in rivalry.But where the lake slept deep and still,
    Dank[278] osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
    And oft both path and hill were torn,
    Where wintry torrent down had borne,
    And heap'd upon the cumber'd land
    Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.So toilsome was the road to trace,
    The guide, abating of his pace,
    Led slowly through the pass's jaws,
    And ask'd Fitz-James, by what strange cause
    He sought these wilds, traversed by few,
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."Brave Gael, my pass in danger tried,
    Hangs in my belt, and by my side;
    Yet, sooth to tell," the Saxon said,
    "I dreamt not now to claim its aid.When here, but three days since, I came,
    Bewilder'd in pursuit of game,
    All seem'd as peaceful and as still
    As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
    Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
    Nor soon expected back from war.Thus said, at least, my mountain guide,
    Though deep, perchance, the villain lied."--
    "Yet why a second venture try?"--
    "A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
    Moves our free course by such fix'd cause
    As gives the poor mechanic laws?Enough, I sought to drive away
    The lazy hours of peaceful day;
    Slight cause will then suffice to guide
    A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
    A falcon flown, a greyhound stray'd,
    The merry glance of mountain maid:
    Or, if a path be dangerous known,
    The danger's self is lure alone.""Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
    Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
    Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
    Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?"--"No, by my word;--of bands prepared
    To guard King James's sports I heard;
    Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
    This muster of the mountaineer,
    Their pennons will abroad be flung,
    Which else in Doune had peaceful hung."--
    "Free be they flung!--for we were loth
    Their silken folds should feast the moth.Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
    Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.But, Stranger, peaceful since you came,
    Bewilder'd in the mountain game,
    Whence the bold boast by which you show[279]
    Vich-Alpine's vow'd and mortal foe?"--
    "Warrior, but yester-morn, I knew
    Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Save as an outlaw'd desperate man,
    The chief of a rebellious clan,
    Who, in the Regent's[280] court and sight,
    With ruffian dagger stabb'd a knight:
    Yet this alone might from his part
    Sever each true and loyal heart."[280] Duke of Albany (see Introduction, p.Wrothful at such arraignment foul,
    Dark lower'd the clansman's sable scowl.A space he paused, then sternly said,
    "And heardst thou why he drew his blade?Heardst thou, that shameful word and blow
    Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?What reck'd the Chieftain if he stood
    On Highland heath, or Holy-Rood?He rights such wrong where it is given,
    If it were in the court of heaven."--
    "Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
    Not then claim'd sovereignty his due;
    While Albany, with feeble hand,
    Held borrow'd truncheon of command,
    The young King, mew'd[281] in Stirling tower,
    Was stranger to respect and power.[282]
    But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
    Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
    Wrenching from ruin'd Lowland swain
    His herds and harvest rear'd in vain.--
    Methinks a soul, like thine, should scorn
    The spoils from such foul foray borne."[282] That period of Scottish history from the battle of Flodden to the
majority of James V. was full of disorder and violence.The Gael beheld him grim the while,
    And answer'd with disdainful smile,--
    "Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
    I mark'd thee send delighted eye,
    Far to the south and east, where lay,
    Extended in succession gay,
    Deep waving fields and pastures green,
    With gentle <DW72>s and groves between:--
    These fertile plains, that soften'd vale,
    Were once the birthright of the Gael;
    The stranger came with iron hand,
    And from our fathers reft[283] the land.See, rudely swell
    Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.Ask we this savage hill we tread,
    For fatten'd steer or household bread;
    Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,--
    And well the mountain might reply,
    'To you, as to your sires of yore,
    Belong the target and claymore!I give you shelter in my breast,
    Your own good blades must win the rest.'Pent in this fortress of the north,
    Thinkst thou we will not sally forth,
    To spoil the spoiler as we may,
    And from the robber rend the prey?Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
    The Saxon rears one shock of grain;
    While, of ten thousand herds, there strays
    But one along yon river's maze,--
    The Gael, of plain and river heir,
    Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share.Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold,
    That plundering Lowland field and fold
    Is aught but retribution true?Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu."Answer'd Fitz-James,--"And, if I sought,
    Thinkst thou no other could be brought?What deem ye of my path waylaid?My life given o'er to ambuscade?"--
    "As of a meed to rashness due:
    Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
    I seek my hound, or falcon stray'd,
    I seek, good faith,[284] a Highland maid,--
    Free hadst thou been to come and go;
    But secret path marks secret foe.Nor yet, for this, even as a spy,
    Hadst thou, unheard, been doom'd to die,
    Save to fulfill an augury."--
    "Well, let it pass; nor will I now
    Fresh cause of enmity avow,
    To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.Enough, I am by promise tied
    To match me with this man of pride:
    Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
    In peace; but when I come agen,
    I come with banner, brand, and bow,
    As leader seeks his mortal foe.For lovelorn swain, in lady's bower,
    Ne'er panted for the appointed hour,
    As I, until before me stand
    This rebel Chieftain and his band!"--

[284] "Good faith," i.e., in good faith.--He whistled shrill,
    And he was answer'd from the hill;
    Wild as the scream of the curlew,
    From crag to crag the signal flew.Instant, through copse and heath, arose
    Bonnets and spears and bended bows;
    On right, on left, above, below,
    Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
    From shingles gray their lances start,
    The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
    The rushes and the willow wand
    Are bristling into ax and brand,
    And every tuft of broom gives life
    To plaided warrior arm'd for strife.That whistle garrison'd the glen
    At once with full five hundred men,
    As if the yawning hill to heaven
    A subterranean host had given.Watching their leader's beck and will,
    All silent there they stood, and still.Like the loose crags, whose threatening mass
    Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
    As if an infant's touch could urge
    Their headlong passage down the verge,
    With step and weapon forward flung,
    Upon the mountain side they hung.The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
    Along Benledi's living side,
    Then fix'd his eye and sable brow
    Full on Fitz-James--"How say'st thou now?These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
    And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!"X.

    Fitz-James was brave:--Though to his heart
    The lifeblood thrill'd with sudden start,
    He mann'd himself with dauntless air,
    Return'd the Chief his haughty stare,
    His back against a rock he bore,
    And firmly placed his foot before:--
    "Come one, come all!this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I."Sir Roderick mark'd--and in his eyes
    Respect was mingled with surprise,
    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
    Down sunk the disappearing band;
    Each warrior vanish'd where he stood,
    In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
    Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
    In osiers pale and copses low;
    It seem'd as if their mother Earth
    Had swallowed up her warlike birth.The wind's last breath had toss'd in air
    Pennon, and plaid, and plumage fair,--
    The next but swept a lone hillside,
    Where heath and fern were waving wide:
    The sun's last glance was glinted[285] back,
    From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
    The next, all unreflected, shone
    On bracken green, and cold gray stone.Fitz-James look'd round--yet scarce believed
    The witness that his sight received;
    Such apparition well might seem
    Delusion of a dreadful dream.Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
    And to his look the Chief replied,
    "Fear naught--nay, that I need not say--
    But--doubt not aught from mine array.Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
    As far as Coilantogle ford:
    Nor would I call a clansman's brand
    For aid against one valiant hand,
    Though on our strife lay every vale
    Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.So move we on;--I only meant
    To show the reed on which you leant,
    Deeming this path you might pursue
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."They mov'd:--I said Fitz-James was brave,
    As ever knight that belted glaive;
    Yet dare not say, that now his blood
    Kept on its wont and temper'd flood,[286]
    As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
    That seeming lonesome pathway through,
    Which yet, by fearful proof, was rife
    With lances, that, to take his life,
    Waited but signal from a guide
    So late dishonor'd and defied.Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
    The vanish'd guardians of the ground,
    And still, from copse and heather deep,
    Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
    And in the plover's shrilly strain,
    The signal-whistle heard again.Nor breathed he free till far behind
    The pass was left; for then they wind
    Along a wide and level green,
    Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
    Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
    To hide a bonnet or a spear.The Chief in silence strode before,
    And reach'd that torrent's sounding shore,
    Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,[287]
    From Vennachar in silver breaks,
    Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
    On Bochastle the moldering lines,
    Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
    Of yore her eagle[288] wings unfurl'd.And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
    Threw down his target and his plaid,
    And to the Lowland warrior said,--
    "Bold Saxon!to his promise just,
    Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
    This head of a rebellious clan,
    Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
    Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
    A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.See here, all vantageless[289] I stand,
    Arm'd, like thyself, with single brand:
    For this is Coilantogle ford,
    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."[287] Katrine, Achray, and Vennachar.[288] The eagle, with wings displayed and a thunderbolt in one of its
talons, was the ensign of the Roman legions.Ancient earthworks near
Bochastle are thought to date back to the Roman occupation of Britain.The Saxon paused:--"I ne'er delay'd
    When foeman bade me draw my blade;
    Nay, more, brave Chief, I vow'd thy death:
    Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
    And my deep debt for life preserv'd,
    A better meed have well deserv'd:
    Can naught but blood our feud atone?And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
    The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
    For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred
    Between the living and the dead:
    'Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
    His party conquers in the strife.'"--
    "Then, by my word," the Saxon said,
    "The riddle is already read.Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
    There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy,
    Then yield to Fate, and not to me.To James, at Stirling, let us go,
    When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
    Or if the King shall not agree
    To grant thee grace and favor free,[290]
    I plight mine honor, oath, and word,
    That, to thy native strengths[291] restored,
    With each advantage shalt thou stand,
    That aids thee now to guard thy land."Dark lightning flash'd from Roderick's eye--
    "Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
    Because a wretched kern ye slew,
    Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!Thou add'st but fuel to my hate:--
    My clansman's blood demands revenge.Not yet prepared?--By Heaven, I change
    My thought, and hold thy valor light
    As that of some vain carpet knight,
    Who ill deserved my courteous care,
    And whose best boast is but to wear
    A braid of his fair lady's hair."--
    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
    For I have sworn this braid to stain
    In the best blood that warms thy vein.and, ruth, begone!--
    Yet think not that by thee alone,
    Proud Chief!can courtesy be shown;
    Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
    Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
    Of this small horn one feeble blast
    Would fearful odds against thee cast.But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
    We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."--
    Then each at once his falchion drew,
    Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
    Each look'd to sun, and stream, and plain,
    As what they ne'er might see again;
    Then foot, and point, and eye opposed,
    In dubious strife they darkly closed.Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
    That on the field his targe he threw,
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull hide
    Had death so often dash'd aside;
    For, train'd abroad[292] his arms to wield,
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.He practiced every pass and ward,
    To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
    While less expert, though stronger far,
    The Gael maintain'd unequal war.Three times in closing strife they stood,
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;
    And, as firm rock, or castle roof,
    Against the winter shower is proof,
    The foe, invulnerable still,
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
    And backward borne upon the lea,
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee."Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
    The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!"--
    "Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!Let recreant yield, who fears to die."--Like adder darting from his coil,
    Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
    Like mountain cat who guards her young,
    Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
    Received, but reck'd not of a wound,
    And lock'd his arms his foeman round.--
    Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
    Through bars of brass and triple steel!--
    They tug, they strain!down, down they go,
    The Gael above, Fitz-James below.The Chieftain's gripe his throat compress'd,
    His knee was planted in his breast;
    His clotted locks he backward threw,
    Across his brow his hand he drew,
    From blood and mist to clear his sight,
    Then gleam'd aloft his dagger bright!--
    --But hate and fury ill supplied
    The stream of life's exhausted tide,
    And all too late the advantage came,
    To turn the odds of deadly game;
    For, while the dagger gleam'd on high,
    Reel'd soul and sense, reel'd brain and eye.but in the heath
    The erring blade found bloodless sheath.The struggling foe may now unclasp
    The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
    Unwounded from the dreadful close,
    But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.He falter'd thanks to Heaven for life,
    Redeem'd, unhoped, from desperate strife;
    Next on his foe his look he cast,
    Whose every gasp appear'd his last;
    In Roderick's gore he dipt the braid,--
    "Poor Blanche!thy wrongs are dearly paid:
    Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
    The praise that Faith and Valor give."With that he blew a bugle note,
    Undid the collar from his throat,
    Unbonneted, and by the wave
    Sate down his brow and hands to lave.Then faint afar are heard the feet
    Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
    The sounds increase, and now are seen
    Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
    Two who bear lance, and two who lead,
    By loosen'd rein, a saddled steed;
    Each onward held his headlong course,
    And by Fitz-James rein'd up his horse,--
    With wonder view'd the bloody spot--
    "Exclaim not, gallants!question not.--
    You, Herbert and Luffness, alight,
    And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
    Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
    We destined for a fairer freight,
    And bring him on to Stirling straight;
    I will before at better speed,
    To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.The sun rides high;--I must be boune,
    To see the archer game at noon;
    But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
    De Vaux and Herries, follow me."--the steed obey'd,
    With arching neck and bended head,
    And glancing eye and quivering ear,
    As if he loved his lord to hear.No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
    No grasp upon the saddle laid,
    But wreath'd his left hand in the mane,
    And lightly bounded from the plain,
    Turn'd on the horse his armed heel,
    And stirr'd his courage with the steel.[293]
    Bounded the fiery steed in air,
    The rider sate erect and fair,
    Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
    Forth launch'd, along the plain they go.They dash'd that rapid torrent through,
    And up Carhonie's[294] hill they flew;
    Still at the gallop prick'd[295] the Knight,
    His merry-men follow'd as they might.they ride,
    And in the race they mock thy tide;
    Torry and Lendrick now are past,
    And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
    They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune,
    They sink in distant woodland soon;
    Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
    They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
    They mark just glance and disappear
    The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
    They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides,
    Dark Forth!amid thy sluggish tides,
    And on the opposing shore take ground,
    With plash, with scramble, and with bound.Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!And soon the bulwark of the North,
    Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
    Upon their fleet career look'd down.[294] About a mile from the mouth of Lake Vennachar.As up the flinty path they strain'd,
    Sudden his steed the leader rein'd;
    A signal to his squire he flung,
    Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
    "Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
    Who townward holds the rocky way,
    Of stature tall and poor array?Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
    With which he scales the mountain side?Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?"--
    "No, by my word;--a burly groom
    He seems, who in the field or chase
    A baron's train would nobly grace."--
    "Out, out, De Vaux!can fear supply,
    And jealousy, no sharper eye?Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
    That stately form and step I knew;
    Like form in Scotland is not seen,
    Treads not such step on Scottish green.'Tis James of Douglas, by St.Away, away, to court, to show
    The near approach of dreaded foe:
    The King must stand upon his guard;
    Douglas and he must meet prepared."Then right-hand wheel'd their steeds, and straight
    They won the Castle's postern gate.The Douglas, who had bent his way
    From Cambus-kenneth's Abbey gray,
    Now, as he climb'd the rocky shelf,
    Held sad communion with himself:--
    "Yes!all is true my fears could frame;
    A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
    And fiery Roderick soon will feel
    The vengeance of the royal steel.I, only I, can ward their fate,--
    God grant the ransom come not late!The Abbess hath her promise given,
    My child shall be the bride of Heaven;[296]--
    --Be pardon'd one repining tear!For He, who gave her, knows how dear,
    How excellent!but that is by,
    And now my business is--to die.within whose circuit dread
    A Douglas[297] by his sovereign bled;
    And thou, O sad and fatal mound![298]
    That oft hast heard the death-ax sound,
    As on the noblest of the land
    Fell the stern headsman's bloody hand,--
    The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
    Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!--
    --But hark!what blithe and jolly peal
    Makes the Franciscan[299] steeple reel?upon the crowded street,
    In motley groups what maskers meet!Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
    And merry morris dancers[300] come.I guess, by all this quaint array,
    The burghers hold their sports to-day.[301]
    James will be there; he loves such show,
    Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
    And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
    As well as where, in proud career,
    The high-born tilter shivers spear.I'll follow to the Castle-park,
    And play my prize;--King James shall mark,
    If age has tamed these sinews stark,[302]
    Whose force so oft, in happier days,
    His boyish wonder loved to praise."[296] "Bride of Heaven," i.e., a nun.[297] William, eighth earl of Douglas, was stabbed by James II.while
in Stirling Castle, and under royal safe-conduct.[298] "Heading Hill," where executions took place.[299] A church of the Franciscans or Gray Friars was built near the
castle, in 1494, by James IV.[300] The morris dance was of Moorish origin, and brought from Spain
to England, where it was combined with the national Mayday games.The
dress of the dancers was adorned with party- ribbons, and little
bells were attached to their anklets, armlets, or girdles.The dancers
often personated various fictitious characters.[301] Every borough had its solemn play or festival, where archery,
wrestling, hurling the bar, and other athletic exercises, were engaged
in.The Castle gates were open flung,
    The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung,
    And echo'd loud the flinty street
    Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
    As slowly down the steep descent
    Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
    While all along the crowded way
    Was jubilee and loud huzza.And ever James was bending low,
    To his white jennet's[303] saddlebow,
    Doffing his cap to city dame,
    Who smiled and blush'd for pride and shame.And well the simperer might be vain,--
    He chose the fairest of the train.Gravely he greets each city sire,
    Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
    Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
    And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
    Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
    "Long live the Commons' King,[304] King James!"Behind the King throng'd peer and knight,
    And noble dame, and damsel bright,
    Whose fiery steeds ill brook'd the stay
    Of the steep street and crowded way.--But in the train you might discern
    Dark lowering brow, and visage stern:
    There nobles mourn'd their pride restrain'd,
    And the mean burgher's joys disdain'd;
    And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan,
    Were each from home a banish'd man,
    There thought upon their own gray tower,
    Their waving woods, their feudal power,
    And deem'd themselves a shameful part
    Of pageant which they cursed in heart.in France, James V.
had checked the lawless nobles, and favored the commons or burghers.Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
    Their checker'd[305] bands the joyous rout.There morrisers, with bell at heel,
    And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
    But chief, beside the butts, there stand
    Bold Robin Hood[306] and all his band,--
    Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
    Old Scathlock with his surly scowl,
    Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
    Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;[307]
    Their bugles challenge all that will,
    In archery to prove their skill.The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
    His first shaft centered in the white,
    And when in turn he shot again,
    His second split the first in twain.From the King's hand must Douglas take
    A silver dart,[308] the archer's stake;
    Fondly he watch'd, with watery eye,
    Some answering glance of sympathy,--
    No kind emotion made reply!Indifferent as to archer wight,[309]
    The Monarch gave the arrow bright.[305] In clothing of varied form and color.[306] A renowned English outlaw and robber, supposed to have lived at
the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, and to
have frequented Sherwood Forest.Characters representing him and his
followers were often introduced into the popular games.[307] All six were followers of Robin Hood.[308] The usual prize to the best shooter was a silver arrow.[309] A simple, ordinary archer.for, hand to hand,
    The manly wrestlers take their stand.Two o'er the rest superior rose,
    And proud demanded mightier foes,
    Nor call'd in vain; for Douglas came.--For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
    Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
    Whom senseless home his comrades bear.Prize of the wrestling match, the King
    To Douglas gave a golden ring,
    While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
    As frozen drop of wintry dew.Douglas would speak, but in his breast
    His struggling soul his words suppress'd;
    Indignant then he turn'd him where
    Their arms the brawny yeoman bare,
    To hurl the massive bar in air.When each his utmost strength had shown,
    The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
    From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
    And sent the fragment through the sky,
    A rood beyond the farthest mark;--
    And still in Stirling's royal park,
    The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
    To strangers point the Douglas-cast,[310]
    And moralize on the decay
    Of Scottish strength in modern day.The vale with loud applauses rang,
    The Ladies' Rock[311] sent back the clang.The King, with look unmoved, bestow'd
    A purse well fill'd with pieces broad.Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
    And threw the gold among the crowd,
    Who now, with anxious wonder, scan,
    And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
    Till whispers rose among the throng,
    That heart so free, and hand so strong,
    Must to the Douglas blood belong;
    The old men mark'd, and shook the head,
    To see his hair with silver spread,
    And wink'd aside, and told each son
    Of feats upon the English done,
    Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
    Was exiled from his native land.The women praised his stately form,
    Though wreck'd by many a winter's storm;
    The youth with awe and wonder saw
    His strength surpassing nature's law.Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd,
    Till murmur rose to clamors loud.But not a glance from that proud ring
    Of peers who circled round the King,
    With Douglas held communion kind,
    Or call'd the banish'd man to mind;
    No, not from those who, at the chase,
    Once held his side the honor'd place,
    Begirt[312] his board, and, in the field,
    Found safety underneath his shield;
    For he, whom royal eyes disown,
    When was his form to courtiers known![311] A point from which the ladies of the court viewed the games.The Monarch saw the gambols flag,
    And bade let loose a gallant stag,
    Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
    Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
    That venison free, and Bordeaux wine,
    Might serve the archery to dine.But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
    Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
    The fleetest hound in all the North,--
    Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.She left the royal hounds midway,
    And dashing on the antler'd prey,
    Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
    And deep the flowing lifeblood drank.The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
    By strange intruder broken short,
    Came up, and with his leash unbound,
    In anger struck the noble hound.--The Douglas had endured, that morn,
    The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
    And last, and worst to spirit proud,
    Had borne the pity of the crowd;
    But Lufra had been fondly bred,
    To share his board, to watch his bed,
    And oft would Ellen, Lufra's neck
    In maiden glee with garlands deck;
    They were such playmates, that with name
    Of Lufra, Ellen's image came.His stifled wrath is brimming high,
    In darken'd brow and flashing eye;
    As waves before the bark divide,
    The crowd gave way before his stride;
    Needs but a buffet and no more,
    The groom lies senseless in his gore.Such blow no other hand could deal
    Though gauntleted in glove of steel.Then clamor'd loud the royal train,
    And brandish'd swords and staves amain.But stern the baron's warning--"Back!Back, on[313] your lives, ye menial pack!behold,
    King James!The Douglas, doom'd of old,
    And vainly sought for near and far,
    A victim to atone the war,
    A willing victim, now attends,
    Nor craves thy grace but for his friends."--
    "Thus is my clemency repaid?the Monarch said;
    "Of thy mis-proud[314] ambitious clan,
    Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
    The only man, in whom a foe
    My woman mercy would not know:
    But shall a Monarch's presence brook
    Injurious blow, and haughty look?--
    What ho!Give the offender fitting ward.--
    Break off the sports!"--for tumult rose,
    And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,--
    "Break off the sports!"he said, and frown'd,
    "And bid our horsemen clear the ground."Then uproar wild and misarray[315]
    Marr'd the fair form of festal day.The horsemen prick'd among the crowd,
    Repell'd by threats and insult loud;
    To earth are borne the old and weak,
    The timorous fly, the women shriek;
    With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
    The hardier urge tumultuous war.At once round Douglas darkly sweep
    The royal spears in circle deep,
    And slowly scale the pathway steep;
    While on the rear in thunder pour
    The rabble with disorder'd roar.With grief the noble Douglas saw
    The Commons rise against the law,
    And to the leading soldier said,--
    "Sir John of Hyndford![316] 'twas my blade
    That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;[317]
    For that good deed, permit me then
    A word with these misguided men."[317] Knighthood was conferred by a slight blow with the flat of a
sword on the back of the kneeling candidate.ere yet for me
    Ye break the bands of fealty.My life, my honor, and my cause,
    I tender free to Scotland's laws.Are these so weak as must require
    The aid of your misguided ire?Or, if I suffer causeless wrong,
    Is then my selfish rage so strong,
    My sense of public weal so low,
    That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
    Those cords of love I should unbind,
    Which knit my country and my kind?Believe, in yonder tower
    It will not soothe my captive hour,
    To know those spears our foes should dread,
    For me in kindred gore are red;
    To know, in fruitless brawl begun
    For me, that mother wails her son;
    For me, that widow's mate expires;
    For me, that orphans weep their sires;
    That patriots mourn insulted laws,
    And curse the Douglas for the cause.Oh, let your patience ward[318] such ill,
    And keep your right to love me still!"The crowd's wild fury sunk again
    In tears, as tempests melt in rain.With lifted hands and eyes, they pray'd
    For blessings on his generous head,
    Who for his country felt alone,
    And prized her blood beyond his own.Old men, upon the verge of life,
    Bless'd him who stayed the civil strife;
    And mothers held their babes on high,
    The self-devoted Chief to spy,
    Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
    To whom the prattlers owed a sire:
    Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
    As if behind some bier beloved,
    With trailing arms and drooping head,
    The Douglas up the hill he led,
    And at the Castle's battled verge,
    With sighs resign'd his honor'd charge.The offended Monarch rode apart,
    With bitter thought and swelling heart,
    And would not now vouchsafe again
    Through Stirling streets to lead his train.--
    "O Lennox, who would wish to rule
    This changeling[319] crowd, this common fool?Hear'st thou," he said, "the loud acclaim
    With which they shout the Douglas name?With like acclaim, the vulgar throat
    Strain'd for King James their morning note;
    With like acclaim they hail'd the day
    When first I broke the Douglas' sway;
    And like acclaim would Douglas greet,
    If he could hurl me from my seat.Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood,
    Thou many-headed monster thing,
    Oh, who would wish to be thy king!"what messenger of speed
    Spurs hitherward his panting steed?I guess his cognizance[320] afar--
    What from our cousin,[321] John of Mar?"--
    "He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
    Within the safe and guarded ground:
    For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
    Most sure for evil to the throne,--
    The outlaw'd Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Has summon'd his rebellious crew;
    'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
    These loose banditti stand array'd.The Earl of Mar, this morn, from Doune,
    To break their muster march'd, and soon
    Your grace will hear of battle fought;
    But earnestly the Earl besought,
    Till for such danger he provide,
    With scanty train you will not ride."[321] Monarchs frequently applied this epithet to their noblemen, even
when no blood relationship existed."Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
    I should have earlier look'd to this:
    I lost it in this bustling day.--Retrace with speed thy former way;
    Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
    The best of mine shall be thy meed.Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
    We do forbid the intended war:
    Roderick, this morn, in single fight,
    Was made our prisoner by a knight;
    And Douglas hath himself and cause
    Submitted to our kingdom's laws.The tidings of their leaders lost
    Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
    Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
    For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.Bear Mar our message, Braco: fly!"--
    He turn'd his steed,--"My liege, I hie,--
    Yet, ere I cross this lily lawn,
    I fear the broadswords will be drawn."The turf the flying courser spurn'd,
    And to his towers the King return'd.Ill with King James's mood that day,
    Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
    Soon were dismiss'd the courtly throng,
    And soon cut short the festal song.Nor less upon the sadden'd town
    The evening sunk in sorrow down.The burghers spoke of civil jar,
    Of rumor'd feuds and mountain war,
    Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
    All up in arms:--the Douglas too,
    They mourn'd him pent within the hold,
    "Where stout Earl William[322] was of old."--
    And there his word the speaker stayed,
    And finger on his lip he laid,
    Or pointed to his dagger blade.But jaded horsemen, from the west,
    At evening to the Castle press'd;
    And busy talkers said they bore
    Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
    At noon the deadly fray begun,
    And lasted till the set of sun.Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
    Till closed the Night her pennons brown.[322] The Douglas who was stabbed by James II.I.

    The sun, awakening, through the smoky air
      Of the dark city casts a sullen glance,
    Rousing each caitiff[323] to his task of care,
      Of sinful man the sad inheritance;
    Summoning revelers from the lagging dance,
      Scaring the prowling robber to his den;
    Gilding on battled tower the warder's lance,
      And warning student pale to leave his pen,
    And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men.what scenes of woe,
      Are witness'd by that red and struggling beam!The fever'd patient, from his pallet low,
      Through crowded hospital beholds its stream;
    The ruin'd maiden trembles at its gleam,
      The debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail,
    The lovelorn wretch starts from tormenting dream;
      The wakeful mother, by the glimmering pale,
    Trims her sick infant's couch, and soothes his feeble wail.At dawn the towers of Stirling rang
    With soldier step and weapon clang,
    While drums, with rolling note, foretell
    Relief to weary sentinel.Through narrow loop and casement barr'd,
    The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard,
    And, struggling with the smoky air,
    Deaden'd the torches' yellow glare.In comfortless alliance shone
    The lights through arch of blacken'd stone,
    And show'd wild shapes in garb of war,
    Faces deform'd with beard and scar,
    All haggard from the midnight watch,
    And fever'd with the stern debauch;
    For the oak table's massive board,
    Flooded with wine, with fragments stored,
    And beakers drain'd, and cups o'erthrown,
    Show'd in what sport the night had flown.Some, weary, snored on floor and bench;
    Some labor'd still their thirst to quench;
    Some, chill'd with watching, spread their hands
    O'er the huge chimney's dying brands,
    While round them, or beside them flung,
    At every step their harness[324] rung.[324] Armor and other accouterments of war.These drew not for their fields the sword,
    Like tenants of a feudal lord,
    Nor own'd the patriarchal claim
    Of Chieftain in their leader's name;
    Adventurers[325] they, from far who roved,
    To live by battle which they loved.There the Italian's clouded face,
    The swarthy Spaniard's there you trace;
    The mountain-loving Switzer[326] there
    More freely breathed in mountain air;
    The Fleming[327] there despised the soil,
    That paid so ill the laborer's toil;
    Their rolls show'd French and German name;
    And merry England's exiles came,
    To share, with ill-conceal'd disdain,
    Of Scotland's pay the scanty gain.All brave in arms, well train'd to wield
    The heavy halberd, brand, and shield;
    In camps licentious, wild, and bold;
    In pillage fierce and uncontroll'd;
    And now, by holytide[328] and feast,
    From rules of discipline released.[325] James V. was the first to increase the army furnished by
the nobles and their vassals by the addition of a small number of
mercenaries.[327] An inhabitant of Flanders, as Belgium was then called.They held debate of bloody fray,
    Fought 'twixt Loch Katrine and Achray.Fierce was their speech, and,'mid their words,
    Their hands oft grappled to their swords;
    Nor sunk their tone to spare the ear
    Of wounded comrades groaning near,
    Whose mangled limbs, and bodies gored,
    Bore token of the mountain sword,
    Though, neighboring to the Court of Guard,
    Their prayers and feverish wails were heard;
    Sad burden to the ruffian joke,
    And savage oath by fury spoke!--
    At length up started John of Brent,
    A yeoman from the banks of Trent;
    A stranger to respect or fear,
    In peace a chaser[329] of the deer,
    In host[330] a hardy mutineer,
    But still the boldest of the crew,
    When deed of danger was to do.He grieved, that day, their games cut short,
    And marr'd the dicer's brawling sport,
    And shouted loud, "Renew the bowl!And, while a merry catch I troll,
    Let each the buxom chorus bear,
    Like brethren of the brand and spear."V.

SOLDIER'S SONG.Our vicar still preaches that Peter and Poule[331]
    Laid a swinging[332] long curse on the bonny brown bowl,
    That there's wrath and despair in the jolly black-jack,[333]
    And the seven deadly sins in a flagon of sack;[334]
    Yet whoop, Barnaby!off with thy liquor,
    Drink upsees out,[335] and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar he calls it damnation to sip
    The ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,
    Says, that Beelzebub[336] lurks in her kerchief so sly,
    And Apollyon[337] shoots darts from her merry black eye;
    Yet whoop, Jack!kiss Gillian the quicker,
    Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar thus preaches--and why should he not?For the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;[338]
    And 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch,
    Who infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.off with your liquor,
    Sweet Marjorie's the word, and a fig for the vicar![335] "Upsees out," i.e., in the Dutch fashion, or deeply.[338] "Placket and pot," i.e., women and wine.The warder's challenge, heard without,
    Stayed in mid-roar the merry shout.A soldier to the portal went,--
    "Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;
    And,--beat for jubilee the drum!--
    A maid and minstrel with him come."Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarr'd,
    Was entering now the Court of Guard,
    A harper with him, and in plaid
    All muffled close, a mountain maid,
    Who backward shrunk to'scape the view
    Of the loose scene and boisterous crew.they roar'd.--"I only know,
    From noon till eve we fought with foe
    As wild and as untamable
    As the rude mountains where they dwell;
    On both sides store of blood is lost,
    Nor much success can either boast."--
    "But whence thy captives, friend?such spoil
    As theirs must needs reward thy toil.Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;
    Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp!Get thee an ape, and trudge the land,
    The leader of a juggler band.""No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.After the fight, these sought our line,
    That aged Harper and the girl,
    And, having audience of the Earl,
    Mar bade I should purvey them steed,
    And bring them hitherward with speed.Forbear your mirth and rude alarm,
    For none shall do them shame or harm."--
    "Hear ye his boast?"cried John of Brent,
    Ever to strife and jangling bent;
    "Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,
    And yet the jealous niggard grudge
    To pay the forester his fee?I'll have my share, howe'er it be,
    Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee."Bertram his forward step withstood;
    And, burning in his vengeful mood,
    Old Allan, though unfit for strife,
    Laid hand upon his dagger knife;
    But Ellen boldly stepp'd between,
    And dropp'd at once the tartan screen:--
    So, from his morning cloud, appears
    The sun of May, through summer tears.The savage soldiery, amazed,
    As on descended angel gazed;
    Even hardy Brent, abash'd and tamed,
    Stood half admiring, half ashamed.Boldly she spoke,--"Soldiers, attend!My father was the soldier's friend;
    Cheer'd him in camps, in marches led,
    And with him in the battle bled.Not from the valiant, or the strong,
    Should exile's daughter suffer wrong."--
    Answer'd De Brent, most forward still
    In every feat or good or ill,--
    "I shame me of the part I play'd;
    And thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!An outlaw I by forest laws,
    And merry Needwood[339] knows the cause.Poor Rose,--if Rose be living now,"--
    He wiped his iron eye and brow,--
    "Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--
    Hear ye, my mates;--I go to call
    The Captain of our watch to hall:
    There lies my halberd on the floor;
    And he that steps my halberd o'er,
    To do the maid injurious part,
    My shaft shall quiver in his heart!--
    Beware loose speech, or jesting rough:
    Ye all know John de Brent.[339] A royal forest in Staffordshire.Their Captain came, a gallant young,--
    Of Tullibardine's[340] house he sprung,--
    Nor wore he yet the spurs of knight;
    Gay was his mien, his humor light,
    And, though by courtesy controll'd,
    Forward his speech, his bearing bold.The high-born maiden ill could brook
    The scanning of his curious look
    And dauntless eye;--and yet, in sooth,
    Young Lewis was a generous youth;
    But Ellen's lovely face and mien,
    Ill suited to the garb and scene,
    Might lightly bear construction strange,
    And give loose fancy scope to range."Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!Come ye to seek a champion's aid,
    On palfrey white, with harper hoar,
    Like errant damosel[341] of yore?Does thy high quest[342] a knight require,
    Or may the venture suit a squire?"--
    Her dark eye flash'd;--she paused and sigh'd,--
    "Oh, what have I to do with pride!--
    Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,
    A suppliant for a father's life,
    I crave an audience of the King.Behold, to back my suit, a ring,
    The royal pledge of grateful claims,
    Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James."[340] Tullibardine was an old seat of the Murrays in Perthshire.[341] In the days of chivalry any oppressed "damosel" could obtain
redress by applying to the court of the nearest king, where some knight
became her champion.X.

    The signet ring young Lewis took,
    With deep respect and alter'd look;
    And said,--"This ring our duties own;
    And pardon, if to worth unknown,
    In semblance mean, obscurely veil'd,
    Lady, in aught my folly fail'd.Soon as the day flings wide his gates,
    The King shall know what suitor waits.Please you, meanwhile, in fitting bower
    Repose you till his waking hour;
    Female attendance shall obey
    Your hest, for service or array.But, ere she followed, with the grace
    And open bounty of her race,
    She bade her slender purse be shared
    Among the soldiers of the guard.The rest with thanks their guerdon took;
    But Brent, with shy and awkward look,
    On the reluctant maiden's hold
    Forced bluntly back the proffer'd gold;--
    "Forgive a haughty English heart,
    And oh, forget its ruder part!The vacant purse shall be my share,
    Which in my barret cap I'll bear,
    Perchance, in jeopardy of war,
    Where gayer crests may keep afar."With thanks--'twas all she could--the maid
    His rugged courtesy repaid.When Ellen forth with Lewis went,
    Allan made suit to John of Brent:--
    "My lady safe, oh, let your grace
    Give me to see my master's face!His minstrel I,--to share his doom
    Bound from the cradle to the tomb.Tenth in descent, since first my sires
    Waked for his noble house their lyres,
    Nor one of all the race was known
    But prized its weal above their own.With the Chief's birth begins our care;
    Our harp must soothe the infant heir,
    Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace
    His earliest feat of field or chase;
    In peace, in war, our rank we keep,
    We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,
    Nor leave him till we pour our verse--
    A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.Then let me share his captive lot;
    It is my right--deny it not!"--
    "Little we reck," said John of Brent,
    "We Southern men, of long descent;
    Nor wot we how a name--a word--
    Makes clansmen vassals to a lord:
    Yet kind my noble landlord's part,--
    God bless the house of Beaudesert!And, but I loved to drive the deer,
    More than to guide the laboring steer,
    I had not dwelt an outcast here.Come, good old Minstrel, follow me;
    Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see."Then, from a rusted iron hook,
    A bunch of ponderous keys he took,
    Lighted a torch, and Allan led
    Through grated arch and passage dread.Portals they pass'd, where, deep within,
    Spoke prisoner's moan, and fetters' din;
    Through rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,
    Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman's sword,
    And many an hideous engine grim,
    For wrenching joint, and crushing limb,
    By artist form'd, who deemed it shame
    And sin to give their work a name.They halted at a low-brow'd porch,
    And Brent to Allan gave the torch,
    While bolt and chain he backward roll'd,
    And made the bar unhasp its hold.They enter'd:--'twas a prison room
    Of stern security and gloom,
    Yet not a dungeon; for the day
    Through lofty gratings found its way,
    And rude and antique garniture
    Deck'd the sad walls and oaken floor;
    Such as the rugged days of old
    Deem'd fit for captive noble's hold.[343]
    "Here," said De Brent, "thou mayst remain
    Till the Leech[344] visit him again.Strict is his charge, the warders tell,
    To tend the noble prisoner well."Retiring then, the bolt he drew,
    And the lock's murmurs growl'd anew.Roused at the sound, from lowly bed
    A captive feebly raised his head;
    The wondering Minstrel look'd, and knew--
    Not his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!For, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,
    They, erring, deem'd the Chief he sought.As the tall ship, whose lofty prore[345]
    Shall never stem the billows more,
    Deserted by her gallant band,
    Amid the breakers lies astrand,[346]
    So, on his couch, lay Roderick Dhu!And oft his fever'd limbs he threw
    In toss abrupt, as when her sides
    Lie rocking in the advancing tides,
    That shake her frame with ceaseless beat,
    Yet cannot heave her from the seat;--
    Oh, how unlike her course on sea!Or his free step on hill and lea!--
    Soon as the Minstrel he could scan,
    "What of thy lady?--of my clan?--
    My mother?--Douglas?--tell me all.Yet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear."--
    (For Allan, who his mood well knew,
    Was choked with grief and terror too.)"Who fought--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--
    Some might--for they had lost their Chief.Who basely live?--who bravely died?"--
    "Oh, calm thee, Chief!"the Minstrel cried;
    "Ellen is safe;"--"For that, thank Heaven!"--
    "And hopes are for the Douglas given;--
    The lady Margaret, too, is well;
    And, for thy clan,--on field or fell,
    Has never harp of minstrel told
    Of combat fought so true and bold.Thy stately Pine is yet unbent,
    Though many a goodly bough is rent."The Chieftain rear'd his form on high,
    And fever's fire was in his eye;
    But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks
    Checker'd his swarthy brow and cheeks.I have heard thee play,
    With measure bold, on festal day,
    In yon lone isle,... again where ne'er
    Shall harper play, or warrior hear!That stirring air that peals on high,
    O'er Dermid's[347] race our victory.--
    Strike it!--and then, (for well thou canst,)
    Free from thy minstrel spirit glanced,
    Fling me the picture of the fight,
    When met my clan the Saxon might.I'll listen, till my fancy hears
    The clang of swords, the crash of spears!These grates, these walls, shall vanish then,
    For the fair field of fighting men,
    And my free spirit burst away,
    As if it soar'd from battle fray."The trembling Bard with awe obey'd,--
    Slow on the harp his hand he laid;
    But soon remembrance of the sight
    He witness'd from the mountain's height,
    With what old Bertram told at night,
    Awaken'd the full power of song,
    And bore him in career along;--
    As shallop launch'd on river's tide,
    That slow and fearful leaves the side,
    But, when it feels the middle stream,
    Drives downward swift as lightning's beam.The Clan-Alpine, or the MacGregors, and the
Campbells, were hereditary enemies.BATTLE OF BEAL' AN DUINE."The Minstrel came once more to view
    The eastern ridge of Benvenue,
    For ere he parted, he would say
    Farewell to lovely Loch Achray--
    Where shall he find, in foreign land,
    So lone a lake, so sweet a strand!There is no breeze upon the fern,
        Nor ripple on the lake,
      Upon her eyry nods the erne,[348]
        The deer has sought the brake;
      The small birds will not sing aloud,
        The springing trout lies still,
      So darkly glooms yon thunder cloud,
      That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
        Benledi's distant hill.Is it the thunder's solemn sound
        That mutters deep and dread,
      Or echoes from the groaning ground
        The warrior's measured tread?Is it the lightning's quivering glance
        That on the thicket streams,
      Or do they flash on spear and lance
        The sun's retiring beams?I see the dagger crest of Mar,
    I see the Moray's silver star,
    Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
    That up the lake comes winding far!To hero bound for battle strife,
        Or bard of martial lay,
      'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
        One glance at their array!"[348] The sea eagle or osprey."Their light arm'd archers far and near
        Survey'd the tangled ground;
      Their center ranks, with pike and spear,
        A twilight forest frown'd;
      Their barbed[349] horsemen, in the rear,
        The stern battalia[350] crown'd.No cymbal clash'd, no clarion rang,
        Still were the pipe and drum;
      Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
        The sullen march was dumb.There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
        Or wave their flags abroad;
      Scarce the frail aspen seem'd to quake,
        That shadow'd o'er their road.Their vaward[351] scouts no tidings bring,
        Can rouse no lurking foe,
      Nor spy a trace of living thing,
        Save when they stirr'd the roe;
      The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
      Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
        High swelling, dark, and slow.The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
    And here the horse and spearmen pause.While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer men.""At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
    Had peal'd the banner cry of hell!Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life!their plight they ply--
      And shriek, and shout, and battle cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
        Pursuers and pursued;
      Before that tide of flight and chase,
      How shall it keep its rooted place,
        The spearmen's twilight wood?--
      'Down, down,' cried Mar, 'your lances down!--
      Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
      That serried grove of lances brown
        At once lay level'd low;
      And closely shouldering side to side,
      The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
      'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
        As their Tinchel[352] cows the game!They come as fleet as forest deer,
        We'll drive them back as tame.'"--

[352] A circle of sportsmen surrounding a large space, which was
gradually narrowed till the game it inclosed was brought within reach."Bearing before them, in their course,
    The relics of the archer force,
    Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
    Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.Above the tide, each broadsword bright
      Was brandishing like beam of light,
        Each targe was dark below;
      And with the ocean's mighty swing,
      When heaving to the tempest's wing,
        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,
    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
    I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
    As if an hundred anvils rang!But Moray wheel'd his rearward rank
    Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,
        --'My banner man, advance!I see,' he cried, 'their column shake.--
      Now, gallants!for your ladies' sake,
        Upon them with the lance!'--
      The horsemen dash'd among the rout,
        As deer break through the broom;
      Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
        They soon make lightsome room.Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
        Where, where was Roderick then?One blast upon his bugle horn
        Were worth a thousand men.And refluent[353] through the pass of fear
        The battle's tide was pour'd;
      Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
        Vanish'd the mountain sword.As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
        Receives her roaring linn,
      As the dark caverns of the deep
        Suck the dark whirlpool in,
    So did the deep and darksome pass
    Devour the battle's mingled mass:
    None linger now upon the plain,
    Save those who ne'er shall fight again.""Now westward rolls the battle's din,
    That deep and doubling pass within.the work of fate
    Is bearing on: its issue wait,
    Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
    Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.Gray Benvenue I soon repass'd,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
          The lowering scowl of heaven
      An inky hue of livid blue
          To the deep lake has given;
    Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
    Swept o'er the lake, then sunk agen.I heeded not the eddying surge,
    Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
    Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
    Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
    And spoke the stern and desperate strife
    That parts not but with parting life,
    Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
    The dirge of many a passing soul.Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
      The martial flood disgorged agen,
          But not in mingled tide;
      The plaided warriors of the North
      High on the mountain thunder forth
          And overhang its side;
      While by the lake below appears
      The dark'ning cloud of Saxon spears.At weary bay each shatter'd band,
      Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
      Their banners stream like tatter'd sail,
      That flings its fragments to the gale,
      And broken arms and disarray
      Mark'd the fell havoc of the day.""Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
    The Saxon stood in sullen trance,
    Till Moray pointed with his lance,
        And cried--'Behold yon isle!--
    See!none are left to guard its strand,
    But women weak, that wring the hand:
    'Tis there of yore the robber band
        Their booty wont to pile;--
    My purse, with bonnet pieces[354] store,
    To him will swim a bowshot o'er,
    And loose a shallop from the shore.Lightly we'll tame the war wolf then,
    Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.'--
    Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
    On earth his casque and corselet rung,
        He plunged him in the wave:--
    All saw the deed--the purpose knew,
    And to their clamors Benvenue
        A mingled echo gave;
    The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
    The helpless females scream for fear,
    And yells for rage the mountaineer.'Twas then, as by the outcry riven,
    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;
    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,
    To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
    For round him shower'd,'mid rain and hail,
    The vengeful arrows of the Gael.--
    In vain--He nears the isle--and lo!His hand is on a shallop's bow.--Just then a flash of lightning came,
    It tinged the waves and strand with flame;--
    I mark'd Duncraggan's widow'd dame--
    Behind an oak I saw her stand,
    A naked dirk gleam'd in her hand:
    It darken'd,--but, amid the moan
    Of waves, I heard a dying groan;
    Another flash!--the spearman floats
    A weltering corse beside the boats,
    And the stern matron o'er him stood,
    Her hand and dagger streaming blood."[354] A bonnet piece is an elegant gold coin, bearing on one side the
head of James V. wearing a bonnet.the Saxons cried--
    The Gael's exulting shout replied.Despite the elemental rage,
    Again they hurried to engage;
    But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
    Bloody with spurring came a knight,
    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,
    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.Clarion and trumpet by his side
    Rung forth a truce note high and wide,
    While, in the Monarch's name, afar
    An herald's voice forbade the war,
    For Bothwell's lord, and Roderick bold,
    Were both, he said, in captive hold."--But here the lay made sudden stand,
    The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!--
    Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
    How Roderick brook'd his minstrelsy:
    At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
    With lifted hand, kept feeble time;
    That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
    Varied his look as changed the song;
    At length, no more his deafen'd ear
    The minstrel melody can hear;
    His face grows sharp,--his hands are clench'd,
    As if some pang his heartstrings wrench'd;
    Set are his teeth, his fading eye
    Is sternly fix'd on vacancy;
    Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew
    His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu!--
    Old Allan-Bane look'd on aghast,
    While grim and still his spirit pass'd:
    But when he saw that life was fled,
    He pour'd his wailing o'er the dead."And art them cold and lowly laid,
    Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
    Breadalbane's[355] boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!For thee shall none a requiem say?--
    For thee,--who loved the Minstrel's lay,
    For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
    The shelter of her exiled line?E'en in this prison house of thine,
    I'll wail for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"What groans shall yonder valleys fill!What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
    When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
    Thy fall before the race was won,
    Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!There breathes not clansman of thy line,
    But would have given his life for thine.--
    Oh, woe for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
    The captive thrush may brook the cage,
    The prison'd eagle dies for rage.And, when its notes awake again,
    Even she, so long beloved in vain,
    Shall with my harp her voice combine,
    And mix her woe and tears with mine,
    To wail Clan-Alpine's honor'd Pine."--

[355] The region bordering Loch Tay.Ellen, the while, with bursting heart,
    Remain'd in lordly bower apart,
    Where play'd, with many- gleams,
    Through storied[356] pane the rising beams.In vain on gilded roof they fall,
    And lighten'd up a tapestried wall,
    And for her use a menial train
    A rich collation spread in vain.The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
    Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
    Or if she look'd, 'twas but to say,
    With better omen dawn'd the day
    In that lone isle, where waved on high
    The dun deer's hide for canopy;
    Where oft her noble father shared
    The simple meal her care prepared,
    While Lufra, crouching by her side,
    Her station claim'd with jealous pride,
    And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
    Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
    Whose answer, oft at random made,
    The wandering of his thoughts betray'd.--
    Those who such simple joys have known,
    Are taught to prize them when they're gone.But sudden, see, she lifts her head!What distant music has the power
    To win her in this woeful hour!'Twas from a turret that o'erhung
    Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.[356] Stained or painted to form pictures illustrating history.LAY OF THE IMPRISONED HUNTSMAN."My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
    My idle greyhound loathes his food,
    My horse is weary of his stall,
    And I am sick of captive thrall.I wish I were, as I have been,
    Hunting the hart in forest green,
    With bended bow and bloodhound free,
    For that's the life is meet for me."I hate to learn the ebb of time,
    From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
    Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
    Inch after inch, along the wall.The lark was wont my matins ring,
    The sable rook my vespers sing;
    These towers, although a king's they be,
    Have not a hall of joy for me."No more at dawning morn I rise,
    And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
    Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
    And homeward wend with evening dew;
    A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
    And lay my trophies at her feet,
    While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
    That life is lost to love and me!"The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
    The list'ner had not turn'd her head,
    It trickled still, the starting tear,
    When light a footstep struck her ear,
    And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.She turn'd the hastier, lest again
    The prisoner should renew his strain."Oh, welcome, brave Fitz-James!"she said;
    "How may an almost orphan maid
    Pay the deep debt"--"Oh, say not so!the boon to give,
    And bid thy noble father live;
    I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
    With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.No tyrant he, though ire and pride
    May lay his better mood aside.'tis more than time--
    He holds his court at morning prime."With beating heart, and bosom wrung,
    As to a brother's arm she clung.Gently he dried the falling tear,
    And gently whisper'd hope and cheer;
    Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,[357]
    Through gallery fair and high arcade,
    Till, at his touch, its wings of pride
    A portal arch unfolded wide.Within 'twas brilliant all and light,
    A thronging scene of figures bright;
    It glow'd on Ellen's dazzled sight,
    As when the setting sun has given
    Ten thousand hues to summer even,
    And from their tissue, fancy frames
    Aerial[358] knights and fairy dames.Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
    A few faint steps she forward made,
    Then slow her drooping head she raised,
    And fearful round the presence[359] gazed;
    For him she sought, who own'd this state,
    The dreaded Prince, whose will was fate!--
    She gazed on many a princely port,
    Might well have ruled a royal court;
    On many a splendid garb she gazed,
    Then turn'd bewilder'd and amazed,
    For all stood bare; and, in the room,
    Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.To him each lady's look was lent;
    On him each courtier's eye was bent;
    Midst furs, and silks, and jewels sheen,
    He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
    The center of the glittering ring,--
    And Snowdoun's Knight[360] is Scotland's King.[360] James V. was accustomed to make personal investigation of the
condition of his people.The name he generally assumed when in disguise
was "Laird of Ballingeich."As wreath of snow, on mountain breast,
    Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
    Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
    And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
    No word her choking voice commands,--
    She show'd the ring--she clasp'd her hands.not a moment could he brook,
    The generous Prince, that suppliant look!Gently he raised her; and, the while,
    Check'd with a glance the circle's smile;
    Graceful, but grave, her brow he kiss'd,
    And bade her terrors be dismiss'd:--
    "Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James
    The fealty of Scotland claims.To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
    He will redeem his signet ring.Ask naught for Douglas; yestereven,
    His Prince and he have much forgiven:
    Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue--
    I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
    Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
    Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
    Our council aided, and our laws.I stanch'd thy father's death-feud stern
    With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
    And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
    The friend and bulwark of our Throne.--
    But, lovely infidel, how now?Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
    Thou must confirm this doubting maid."Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
    And on his neck his daughter hung.The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
    The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
    When it can say, with godlike voice,
    Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!Yet would not James the general eye
    On Nature's raptures long should pry;
    He stepp'd between--"Nay, Douglas, nay,
    Steal not my proselyte away!The riddle 'tis my right to read,
    That brought this happy chance to speed.[361]
    Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
    In life's more low but happier way,
    'Tis under name which veils my power;
    Nor falsely veils--for Stirling's tower
    Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
    And Normans call me James Fitz-James.Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
    Thus learn to right the injured cause."--
    Then, in a tone apart and low,--
    "Ah, little traitress!none must know
    What idle dream, what lighter thought,
    What vanity full dearly bought,
    Join'd to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
    My spellbound steps to Benvenue,
    In dangerous hour, and all but gave
    Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!"--
    Aloud he spoke,--"Thou still dost hold
    That little talisman of gold,
    Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring--
    What seeks fair Ellen of the King?"Full well the conscious maiden guess'd
    He probed the weakness of her breast;
    But, with that consciousness, there came
    A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
    And more she deem'd the Monarch's ire
    Kindled 'gainst him, who, for her sire,
    Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
    And, to her generous feeling true,
    She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu."Forbear thy suit:--the King of kings
    Alone can stay life's parting wings.I know his heart, I know his hand,
    Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;--
    My fairest earldom would I give
    To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
    Hast thou no other boon to crave?Blushing, she turn'd her from the King,
    And to the Douglas gave the ring,
    As if she wish'd her sire to speak
    The suit that stain'd her glowing cheek.--
    "Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
    And stubborn Justice holds her course.--
    Malcolm, come forth!"--and, at the word,
    Down kneel'd the Graeme to Scotland's Lord."For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
    From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
    Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
    Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
    And sought, amid thy faithful clan,
    A refuge for an outlaw'd man,
    Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
    Fetters and warder for the Graeme!"--
    His chain of gold the King unstrung,
    The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
    Then gently drew the glittering band,
    And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.The hills grow dark,
      On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
    In twilight copse the glowworm lights her spark,
      The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.the fountain lending,
      And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
    Thy numbers sweet with Nature's vespers blending,
      With distant echo from the fold and lea,
    And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing[362] bee.Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway!And little reck I of the censure sharp
      May idly cavil at an idle lay.Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
      Through secret woes the world has never known,
    When on the weary night dawn'd wearier day,
      And bitterer was the grief devour'd alone.That I o'erlived such woes, Enchantress!as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
      Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire--
      'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.Receding now, the dying numbers ring
      Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell,
    And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
      A wandering witch note of the distant spell--
    And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!A series of arches supported by columns or piers, either open
or backed by masonry.A kind of cap or head gear formerly worn by soldiers.A wall or rampart around the top of a castle, with openings
to look through and annoy the enemy.A capacious drinking cup or can formerly made of waxed
leather.A person knighted on some other ground than that of
military service; a knight who has not known the hardships of war.To grapple; to come to close quarters in fight.A kind of cap worn by Scottish matrons.The plume or decoration on the top of a helmet.The ridge of the neck of a horse or dog.A bridge at the entrance of a castle, which, when lowered
by chains, gave access across the moat or ditch surrounding the
structure.Something which was bestowed as a token of good will or of
love, as a glove or a knot of ribbon, to be worn habitually by a
knight-errant.A seeming aim at one part when it is
intended to strike another.Pertaining to that political form in which there was a chain of
persons holding land of one another on condition of performing certain
services.Every man in the chain was bound to his immediate superior,
held land from him, took oath of allegiance to him, and became his man.A trumpet call; a fanfare or prelude by one or more trumpets
performed on the approach of any person of distinction.The front of a stag's head; the horns.A long-handled weapon armed with a steel point, and having a
crosspiece of steel with a cutting edge.An upper garment of leather, worn for defense by common soldiers.It was sometimes strengthened by small pieces of metal stitched into it."To give law" to a stag is to allow it a start of a certain
distance or time before the hounds are slipped, the object being to
insure a long chase.A cage for hawks while mewing or moulting: hence an inclosure, a
place of confinement.In the Roman Catholic Church the first canonical hour of prayer,
six o'clock in the morning, generally the first quarter of the day.A stout staff used as a weapon of defense.In using it,
one hand was placed in the middle, and the other halfway between the

of game.A cup of wine drunk on parting from a friend on horseback.A valley of considerable size, through which a river flows.An officer of the forest, who had the nocturnal care of vert
and venison.A song the parts of which are sung in succession; a round.To sing in the manner of a catch or round, also in a full, jovial voice.The skin of the squirrel, much used in the fourteenth century as
fur for garments.A guarding or defensive position or motion in fencing._The Lady of the Lake_ is usually read in the first year of the high
school course, and it is with this fact in mind that the following
suggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

Transcriber's Notes:

     Underscores "_" before and after a word or phrase indicate italics
       in the original text.The word "onomatopoeia" uses an "oe" ligature in the original.A few words use diacritical characters in the original.For in the cunning Brownie crowd
    No domineering is allowed;
    All stand alike with equal power,
    And friendly feeling rules the hour.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' prophecy was true.That night the wind increased and blew,
    And dipped the sails into the wave,
    And work to every Brownie gave;
    Not one on board but had to clew,
    Or reef, or steer, or something do.Sometimes the yachts ran side by side
    A mile or more, then parted wide,
    Still tacking round and shifting sail
    To take advantage of the gale.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Sometimes a sloop beyond control
    At random ran, or punched a hole
    Clean through her scudding rival's jibs,
    Or thumped her soundly on the ribs.Of Brownies there were two or three
    Who tumbled headlong in the sea,
    While they performed some action bold,
    And failed to keep a proper hold.At first it seemed they would be lost;
    For here and there they pitched and tossed,
    Now on the crests of billows white,
    Now in the trough, clear out of sight,
    But all the while with valiant heart
    Performing miracles of art.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Some life-preservers soon were thrown;
    And ready hands let sails alone,
    And turned to render aid with speed
    To those who stood so much in need.But accident could not displace
    Or weaken interest in the race;
    And soon each active Brownie stood
    Where he could do the greatest good;
    It mattered not if shifting sail,
    Or at the helm, or on the rail.With arm to arm and hip to hip,
    They lay in rows to trim the ship.[Illustration]

    All hands were anxious to succeed
    And prove their yachts had greatest speed.But though we sail, or though we ride,
    Or though we sleep, the moments glide;
    And none must bear this fact in mind
    More constantly than Brownie kind.For stars began to lose their glow
    While Brownies still had miles to go.Said one, who scanned the eastern sky
    With doubtless an experienced eye:
    "We'll crowd all sail, for fear the day
    Will find us still upon the bay--
    Since it would prove a sad affair
    If morning light should find us there."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But when the winds began to fail
    And lightly pressed the flapping sail,
    It was determined by the band
    To run their yachts to nearest land,
    So they could reach their hiding-place
    Before the sun revealed his face.[Illustration]

    By happy chance a cove they reached
    Where high and dry the boats were beached,
    And all in safety made their way
    To secret haunts without delay.[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT ARCHERY.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          One night the Brownies strayed around
          A green and level stretch of ground,
          Where young folk oft their skill displayed
          At archery, till evening's shade.The targets standing in the park,
          With arrows resting in the mark,
    Soon showed the cunning Brownie band
    The skill of those who'd tried a hand.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          A few in outer rings were fast,
          Some pierced the "gold," and more had passed
          Without a touch, until they sank
          In trunk of tree or grassy bank.Said one: "On page and parchment old,
          The story often has been told,
          How men of valor bent the bow
          To spread confusion through the foe.And even now, in later times
          (As travelers find in distant climes),
    Some savage tribes on plain and hill
    Can make it interesting still."Another spoke: "A scene like this,
    Reminds me of that valiant Swiss,
    Who in the dark and trying hour
    Revealed such nerve and matchless power,
          And from the head of his brave son
          The apple shot, and freedom won!While such a chance is offered here,
          We'll find the bows that must be near,
          And as an hour or two of night
          Will bring us 'round the morning light,
          We'll take such targets as we may,
            To safer haunts, some miles away.Then at our leisure we can shoot
            At bull's-eyes round or luscious fruit,
            Till like the Swiss of olden time,
            With steady nerves and skill sublime,
            Each one can split an apple fair
            On every head that offers there."[Illustration]

    Now buildings that were fastened tight
    Against the prowlers of the night,
    At the wee Brownies' touch and call
    Soon opened and surrendered all.So some with bulky targets strode,
    That made for eight or ten a load.And called for engineering skill
    To steer them up or down the hill;
    Some carried bows of rarest kind,
    That reached before and trailed behind.The English "self-yew" bow was there,
    Of nicest make and "cast" so rare,
    Well tipped with horn, the proper thing,
    With "nocks," or notches, for the string.Still others formed an "arrow line"
    That bristled like the porcupine.[Illustration]

    When safe within the forest shade,
    The targets often were displayed.At first, however near they stood,
    Some scattered trouble through the wood.The trees were stripped of leaves and bark,
    With arrows searching for the mark.The hares to other groves withdrew,
    And frighted birds in circles flew.But practice soon improves the art
        Of all, however dull or smart;
                             And there they stood to do their best,
                             And let all other pleasures rest,
                             While quickly grew their skill and power,
                             And confidence, from hour to hour.[Illustration]

    When targets seemed too plain or wide,
    A smaller mark the Brownies tried.By turns each member took his stand
    And risked his head to serve the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For volunteers would bravely hold
    A pumpkin till in halves it rolled;
    And then a turnip, quince, or pear,
    Would next be shot to pieces there;
    Till not alone the apples flew
    In halves before their arrows true,
    But even plums and cherries too.For Brownies, as we often find,
    Can soon excel the human kind,
    And carry off with effort slight
    The highest praise and honors bright.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES FISHING.[Illustration]

    When glassy lakes and streams about
    Gave up their bass and speckled trout,
    The Brownies stood by water clear
    As shades of evening gathered near.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                          Said one: "Now country lads begin
                          To trim the rod and bend the pin
                          To catch the frogs and minnows spry
                          That in the brooks and ditches lie.While city chaps with reels come down,
                          And line enough to gird the town,
                          And flies of stranger shape and hue
                          Than ever Mother Nature knew--
                          With horns like crickets, tails like mice,
                          And plumes like birds of Paradise.Thus well prepared for sunny sky
              Or cloudy weather, wet or dry,
              They take the fish from stream and pool
              By native art and printed rule."Another said: "With peeping eyes
              I've watched an angler fighting flies,
              And thought, when thus he stood to bear
              The torture from those pests of air,
              There must indeed be pleasure fine
              Behind the baited hook and line.Now, off like arrows from the bow
    In search of tackle some must go;
    While others stay to dig supplies
    Of bait that anglers highly prize,--
    Such kind as best will bring the pout
    The dace, the chub, and'shiner' out;
    While locusts gathered from the grass
    Will answer well for thorny bass."Then some with speed for tackle start,
    And some to sandy banks depart,
              And some uplift a stone or rail
              In search of cricket, grub, or snail;
    While more in dewy meadows draw
    The drowsy locust from the straw.Nor is it long before the band
    Stands ready for the sport in hand.It seemed the time of all the year
    When fish the starving stage were near:
              They rose to straws and bits of bark,
              To bubbles bright and shadows dark,
              And jumped at hooks, concealed or bare,
              While yet they dangled in the air.Some Brownies many trials met
              Almost before their lines were wet;
              For stones below would hold them fast,
    And limbs above would stop the cast,
    And hands be forced to take a rest,
    At times when fish were biting best.Some stumbled in above their boots,
    And others spoiled their finest suits;
    But fun went on; for many there
    Had hooks that seemed a charm to bear,
    And fish of various scale and fin
    On every side were gathered in.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The catfish left his bed below,
    With croaks and protests from the go;
    And nerve as well as time it took
    From such a maw to win the hook.With horns that pointed every way,
    And life that seemed to stick and stay,
    Like antlered stag that stands at bay,
    He lay and eyed the Brownie band,
    And threatened every reaching hand.The gamy bass, when playing fine,
    Oft tried the strength of hook and line,
    And strove an hour before his mind
    To changing quarters was resigned.Some eels proved more than even match
    For those who made the wondrous catch,
        And, like a fortune won with ease,
        They slipped through fingers by degrees,
        And bade good-bye to margin sands,
        In spite of half a dozen hands.The hungry, wakeful birds of air
        Soon gathered 'round to claim their share,
        And did for days themselves regale
        On fish of every stripe and scale.Thus sport went on with laugh and shout,
        As hooks went in and fish came out,
        While more escaped with wounded gill,
        And yards of line they're trailing still;
        But day at length began to break,
        And forced the Brownies from the lake.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT NIAGARA FALLS.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' Band, while passing through
    The country with some scheme in view,
    Paused in their race, and well they might,
    When broad Niagara came in sight.Said one: "Give ear to what I say,
    I've been a traveler in my day;
    I've waded through Canadian mud
    To Montmorenci's tumbling flood.Niagara is the fall
    That truly overtops them all--
    The children prattle of its tide,
    And age repeats its name with pride
    The school-boy draws it on his slate,
    The preacher owns its moral weight;
    The tourist views it dumb with awe,
    The Indian paints it for his squaw,
    And tells how many a warrior true
    Went o'er it in his bark canoe,
    And never after friend or foe
    Got sight of man or boat below."Another said: "The Brownie Band
    Upon the trembling brink may stand,
    Where kings and queens have sighed to be,
    But dare not risk themselves at sea."[Illustration]

        Some played along the shelving ledge
        That beetled o'er the river's edge;
        Some gazed in meditation deep
        Upon the water's fearful leap;
        Some went below, to crawl about
        Behind the fall, that shooting out
        Left space where they might safely stand
        And view the scene so wild and grand.Some climbed the trees of cedar kind,
        That o'er the rushing stream inclined,
    To find a seat, to swing and frisk
    And bend the boughs at fearful risk;
    Until the rogues could dip and lave
    Their toes at times beneath the wave.Still more and more would venture out
        In spite of every warning shout.At last the weight that dangled there
        Was greater than the tree could bear.And then the snapping roots let go
        Their hold upon the rocks below,
        And leaping out away it rode
        Upon the stream with all its load!Then shouts that rose above the roar
        Went up from tree-top, and from shore,
        When it was thought that half the band
        Was now forever leaving land.It chanced, for reasons of their own,
        Some men around that tree had thrown
        A lengthy rope that still was strong
        And stretching fifty feet along.Before it disappeared from sight,
        The Brownies seized it in their might,
        And then a strain for half an hour
        Went on between the mystic power
        Of Brownie hands united all,
        And water rushing o'er the fall.But true to friends the
        Brownies strained,
        And inch by inch the tree was gained.Across the awful bend it passed
        With those in danger clinging fast,
        And soon it reached the rocky shore
        With all the Brownies safe once more.And then, as morning showed her face,
        The Brownies hastened from the place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' GARDEN.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night, as spring began to show
                In buds above and blades below,
                The Brownies reached a garden square
                That seemed in need of proper care.Said one, "Neglected ground like this
                Must argue some one most remiss,
                Or beds and paths would here be found
                Instead of rubbish scattered round.Old staves, and boots, and woolen strings,
                With bottles, bones, and wire-springs,
    Are quite unsightly things to see
    Where tender plants should sprouting be.This work must be progressing soon,
    If blossoms are to smile in June."A second said, "Let all give heed:
    On me depend to find the seed.For, thanks to my foreseeing mind,
    To merchants' goods we're not confined.Last autumn, when the leaves grew sere
    And birds sought regions less severe,
    One night through gardens fair I sped,
    And gathered seeds from every bed;
    Then placed them in a hollow tree,
    Where still they rest.So trust to me
    To bring supplies, while you prepare
    The mellow garden-soil with care."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another cried, "While some one goes
    To find the shovels, rakes, and hoes,
    That in the sheds are stowed away,
    We'll use this plow as best we may.Our arms, united at the chain,
                Will not be exercised in vain,
                But, as if colts were in the trace,
    We'll make it dance around the place.I know how deep the share should go,
    And how the sods to overthrow.So not a patch of ground the size
    Of this old cap, when flat it lies,
    But shall attentive care receive,
                    And be improved before we leave."Then some to guide the plow began,
                    Others the walks and beds to plan.And soon they gazed with anxious eyes
                    For those who ran for seed-supplies.But, when they came, one had his say,
                    And thus explained the long delay:
                    "A woodchuck in the tree had made
                    His bed just where the seeds were laid.We wasted half an hour at least
                    In striving to dislodge the beast;
          Until at length he turned around,
          Then, quick as thought, without a sound,
          And ere he had his bearings got,
          The rogue was half across the lot."Then seed was sown in various styles,
    In circles, squares, and single files;
    While here and there, in central parts,
    They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts,
    Some using rake, some plying hoe,
    Some making holes where seed should go;
    While some laid garden tools aside
    And to the soil their hands applied.To stakes and racks more were assigned,
    That climbing-vines support might find.Cried one, "Here, side by side, will stand
    The fairest flowers in the land.The thrifty bees for miles around
    Ere long will seek this plot of ground,
    And be surprised to find each morn
    New blossoms do each bed adorn.And in their own peculiar screed
    Will bless the hands that sowed the seed."And while that night they labored there,
    The cunning rogues had taken care
    With sticks and strings to nicely frame
    In line the letters of their name.That when came round the proper time
    For plants to leaf and vines to climb,
    The Brownies would remembered be,
    If people there had eyes to see.But morning broke (as break it will
    Though one's awake or sleeping still),
    And then the seeds on every side
    The hurried Brownies scattered wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: BROWNIE]

    Along the road and through the lane
    They pattered on the ground like rain,
    Where Brownies, as away they flew,
    Both right and left full handfuls threw,
    And children often halted there
    To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair,
    That sprung like daisies from the mead
    Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed.[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' CELEBRATION.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        One night the Brownies reached a mound
        That rose above the country round.Said one, as seated on the place
        He glanced about with thoughtful face:
        "If almanacs have matters right
    The Fourth begins at twelve to-night,--
    A fitting time for us to fill
    Yon cannon there and shake the hill,
    And make the people all about
    Think war again has broken out.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

    'Tis the star spangled banner
    O long may it wave
    O'er the land of the free
    and the home of the brave

[Illustration]

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.But the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend is, the
invasion, or more properly, the successive invasions of North Africa by
the Phoenicians.Their definite establishment on these shores took place
towards the foundation of Carthage, about 820 years before our era.Yet
we know little of their intercourse or relations with the aboriginal
tribes.When the Romans, a century and a half before Christ, received,
or wrested, the rule of Africa from the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians,
they found before them an indigenous people, whom they indifferently
called Moors, Berbers, or Barbarians.A part of these people were called
also Nudides, which is perhaps considered the same term as nomades.Some ages later, the Romans, too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of
other conquerors, were subjugated by the Vandals, who, during a century,
held possession of North Africa; but, after this time, the Romans again
raised their heads, and completely expelled or extirpated the Vandals,
so that, as before, there were found only two people or races in Africa:
the Romans and the Moors, or aborigines.Towards the middle of the seventh century after Christ, and a few years
after the death of Mahomet, the Romans, in the decline of their power,
had to meet the shock of the victorious arms of the Arabians, who poured
in upon them triumphant from the East; but, too weak to resist this new
tide of invasion, they opposed to them the aborigines, which latter were
soon obliged to continue alone the struggle.The Arabian historians, who recount these wars, speak of _Roumi_ or
Romans (of the Byzantine empire) and the Braber--evidently the
aboriginal tribes--who promptly submitted to the Arabs to rid themselves
of the yoke of the Romans; but, after the retreat of their ancient
masters, they revolted and remained a long time in arms against their
new conquerors--a rule of action which all subjugated nations have been
wont to follow.Were we English now to attempt to expel the French from
Algeria, we, undoubtedly, should be joined by the Arabs; but who would,
most probably, soon also revolt against us, were we to attempt to
consolidate our dominion over them.In the first years of the eighth century, and at the end of the first
century of the Hegira, the conquering Arabs passed over to Spain, and,
inasmuch as they came from Mauritania, the people of Spain gave them the
name of Moors (that of the aborigines of North Africa), although they
had, perhaps, nothing in common with them, if we except their Asiatic
origin.Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab
warriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose
etymology is extremely obscure.[13] From this time the Spaniards have
always given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of
Spain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two
denominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of
Morocco and those in the environs of Senegal.The Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of
Asia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into
Ismaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is
considered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption
of the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet.A second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an
epoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat
of his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending in the complete
submission of Morocco to the power of Yousef Ben Tashfin.One cannnot
now distinguish which tribe of Arabs belong to the first or the second
invasion, but all who can shew the slightest proof, claim to belong to
the first, as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warriors.After eight centuries of rule, the Arabs being expelled from Spain, took
refuge in Barbary, but instead of finding the hospitality and protection
of their brethren, the greater part of them were pillaged or massacred.The remnant of these wretched fugitives settled along the coast; and it
is to their industry and intelligence that we owe the increase, or the
foundation of many of the maritime cities.Here, considered as strangers
and enemies by the natives, whom they detested, the new colonists sought
for, and formed relations with Turks and renegades of all nations,
whilst they kept themselves separate from the Arabs and Berbers.This,
then, is the _bona-fide_ origin of the people whom we now generally call
Moors.History furnishes us with a striking example of how the expelled
Arabs of Spain united with various adventurers against the Berber and
North African Arabs.In the year 1500, a thousand Andalusian cavaliers,
who had emigrated to Algiers, formed an alliance with the Barbarossas
and their fleet of pirates; and, after expelling the native prince,
built the modern city of Algiers.And such was the origin of the
Algerine Corsairs.The general result of these observations would, therefore, lead us to
consider the Moors of the Romans, as the Berbers or aborigines of North
Africa, and the Moors of the Spaniards, as pure Arabians; and if,
indeed, these Arabian cavaliers marshalled with them Berbers, as
auxiliaries, for the conquest of Spain, this fact does not militate
against the broad assumption.The so-called Moors of Senegal and the Sahara, as well as those of
Morocco, are chiefly a mixture of Berbers, Arabs and <DW64>s; but the
present Moors located in the northern coast of Africa, are rather the
descendants from the various conquering nations, and especially from
renegades and Christian slaves.The term Moors is not known to the natives themselves.The people speak
definitely enough of Arabs and of various Berber tribes.The population
of the towns and cities are called generally after the names of these
towns and cities, whilst Tuniseen and Tripoline is applied to all the
inhabitants of the great towns of Tunis and Tripoli.Europeans resident
in Barbary, as a general rule, call all the inhabitants of towns--Moors,
and the peasants or people residents in tents--Arabs.But, in Tripoli, I
found whole villages inhabited by Arabs, and these I thought might be
distinguished as town Arabs.Then the mountains of Tripoli are covered
with Arab villages, and some few considerable towns are inhabited by
people who are _bona-fide_ Arabs.Finally, the capitals of North Africa
are filled with every class of people found in the country.The question is then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the
case of nationalities?or can we, with any degree of precision, define
the limits which distinguish the various races in North Africa?With
regard to the Blacks or <DW64> tribes, there can be no great difficulty.The Jews are also easily distinguished from the rest of the people as
well by their national features as by their dress and habits or customs
of living.But, when we come to the Berbers, Arabs, Moors and Turks, we
can only distinguish them in their usual and ordinary occupations and
manners of life.Whenever they are intermixed, or whenever they change
their position, that is to say, whenever the Arab or Berber comes to
dwell in a town, or a Moor or a Turk goes to reside in the country,
adopting the Arab or Berber dress and mode of living, it is no longer
possible to distinguish the one from the other, or mark the limitation
of races.And since it is seen that the aborigines of Northern Africa consisted,
with the exception of the <DW64> tribes, of the Asiatics of the Caucasian
race or variety, many of whom, like the Phoenicians, have peopled
various cities and provinces of Europe, it is therefore not astonishing
we should find all the large towns and cities of North Africa, where the
human being becomes _policed_, refined and civilized sooner than in
remote and thinly-inhabited districts, teeming with a population, which
at once challenges an European type, and a corresponding origin with the
great European family of nations.North Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion.The
people, indeed, have but one religion.Even the extraneous Judaism is
the same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many
of the religious customs, festivals and traditions.And this has a
surprising effect in assimilating the opposite character and sharpest
peculiarities of various races of otherwise distinct and independant
origin.The population of Morocco presents five distant races and classes of
people; Berbers, Arabs, Moors, Jews and <DW64>s.Turks are not found in
Morocco, and do not come so far west; but sons of Turks by Moorish women
in Kouroglies are included among the Moors, that have emigrated from
Algeria.Maroquine Berbers, include the varieties of the Amayeegh [14]
and the Shelouh, who mostly are located in the mountains, while the
Arabs are settled on the plains.The Moors are the inhabitants of towns and cities, consisting of a
mixture of nearly all races, a great proportion of them being of the
descendants of the Moors expelled from Spain.All these races have been,
and will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work.The
proximate amount of this population is six millions.The greater number
of the towns and cities are situate on the coast, excepting the three or
four capitals, or imperial cities.The other towns of the interior
should be considered rather as forts to awe neighbouring tribes, or as
market villages (_souks_), where the people collect together for the
disposal and exchange of their produce.Numerous tribes, located in the
Atlas, escape the notice of the imposts of imperial authority.Their
varieties and amount of population are equally unknown.In the immense
group of Gibel Thelge (snowy mountains), some of the tribes are said to
have their faces shaved, like Christians, and to wear boots.We can
understand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and
perpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like
Christians, this is rather vague.But it is not impossible the Atlas
contains the descendants of some European refugees.The nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of
Spain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from
other parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic,
along which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of
twelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied
surface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the
absence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal
disease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the
most healthy in all Africa.In the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of
Spain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat,
but this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production
of valuable staple articles of commerce.Nevertheless, Morocco has its
extremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.The most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe, is
the vast Atlas chain of mountains [15], which traverses Morocco from
north-east to south-west, whose present ascertained culminating point,
Miltsin, is upwards of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, or equal
to the highest peaks of the Pyrenees.The Maroquine portion of the Atlas
contains its highest peaks, which stretch from the east of Tripoli to
the Atlantic Ocean, at Santa Cruz; and we find no mountains of equal
height, except in the tenth degree of North latitude, or 18,000 miles
south, or 30,000 south, south-east.The Rif coast has a mountainous
chain of some considerable height, but the Atlantic coast offers chiefly
ridges of hills.The coasts of Morocco are not much indented, and
consequently have few ports, and these offer poor protection from the
ocean.The general surface of Morocco presents a large ridge or lock, with two
immense declivities, one sloping N.W.to the ocean, with various rivers
and streams descending from this enormous back-bone of the Atlas, and
the other fulling towards the Sahara, S.E., feeding the streams and
affluents of Wad Draha, and other rivers, which are lost in the sands of
the Desert.This shape of the country prevents the formation of those
vast _Sebhahas_, or salt lakes, so frequent in Algeria and the south of
Tunis.We are acquainted only with two lakes of fresh or sweet
water--that of Debaia, traversed by Wad Draha,--and that of
Gibel-Akhder, which Leo compares to Lake Bolsena.The height of the
mountains, and the uniformity of their <DW72>s, produce large and
numerous rivers; indeed, the most considerable of all North Africa.These rivers of the North are shortest, but have the largest volume of
water; those of the South are larger, but are nearly dry the greater
part of the year.Some abound
with fish, particularly the Shebbel, or Barbary salmon.It is neither so
rich nor so large as our salmon, and is whitefleshed; it tastes
something like herring, but is of a finer and more delicate flavour.They are abundant in the market of Mogudor.The Shebbel, converted by
the Spaniards Sabalo, is found in the Guadalquivir.The products of the soil are nearly the same as in other parts of
Barbary.On the plains, or in the open country, the great cultivation is
wheat and barley; in suburban districts, vegetables and fruits are
propagated.In a commercial point of view, the North exports cattle,
grain, bark, leeches, and skins; and the South exports gums, almonds,
ostrich-feathers, wax, wool, and skins, as principle staple produce.When the rains cease or fail, the cultivation is kept up by irrigation,
and an excellent variety of fruits and esculent vegetables are produced;
indeed, nearly all the vegetables and fruit-trees of Southern Europe are
here abundantly and successfully cultivated, besides those peculiar to
an African clime and soil.In the south, grows a tree peculiar to this
country, the Eloeondenron Argan, so called from its Arabic name Argan.This tree produces fruit resembling the olive, whose egg-shaped, brown,
smooth and very hard stone, encloses a flat almond, of a white colour,
and of a very disagreeable taste, which, when crushed, produces a rancid
oil, used commonly as a substitute for olive-oil.The tree itself is
bushy and large, and sometimes grows of the size to a wide-spreading
oak.Not far from Mogador are several Argan forests.The level country
of the north is covered with forests of dwarfish oak; some bear sweet,
and others bitter acorns, and also the cork-tree, whose bark is a
considerable object of commerce.In the Atlas, has been found the
magnificent cedar of Lebanon.This tree has also been met with in
Algeria, but only on the mountains, some forty thousand feet above the
level of the sea.In the South there is, of course, growing in all its Saharan vigour, the
noble date-palm, and by its side, squats the palmetto, or dwarf-palm (in
Arabic _dauma_).Of trees and plants, the usual tinzah, and snouber or
pine of Aleppo, are used for preparing the fine leathers of Morocco.Many plants are also deleteriously employed for exciting intoxication,
or inflaming the passions.Morocco has its mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, sulphur,
mineral, salt, and antimony; but nearly all are neglected, or unworked.Government will not encourage the industry of the people, for fear of
exciting the cupidity of foreigners.A Frenchman, a short time ago,
reported a silver mine in the south, and Government immediately bribed
him to make another statement that there was no such mine.At Elala and
Stouka, in the province of Sous, are several rich silver mines.Gold is
found in the Atlas and the Lower Sous.But this country is especially
rich in copper mines.A great number of ancient and modern authors speak
of these mines, which are situate in the mountainous country comprised
between Aghadir, Morocco, Talda, Tamkrout, and Akka.The mines most
worked, are those of Tedsi and Afran.At the foot of the Atlas, near
Taroudant, is a great quantity of sulphur.In the neighbourhood of
Morocco, saltpetre is found.In the province of Abda is an extensive
salt lake, and salt has been exported from this country to Timbuctoo.Of
precious stones, some fine specimens of amethyst have been discovered.There are scarcely any animals peculiar to Morocco, or which are not
found in other parts of North Africa.Davidson mentions some curious
facts relative to the desert horse; "_sherb-errech_, wind-bibber, or
drinker of the wind," a variety of this animal, which is not to be met
with in the Saharan regions of Tunis, or Tripoli.This horse is fed only on camel's milk, and is principally used for
hunting ostriches, which are run down by it, and then captured.[16] The
_sherb-errech_ will continue running three or four days together without
any food.It is a slight and spare-formed animal, mostly in wretched
condition, with ugly thick legs, and devoid of beauty as a horse.Division of Morocco into kingdoms or States, and zones or regions.--

such divisions scarcely exist in the administration of the native
princes.The ancient division mentioned by Leo was that of two large
provinces of Morocco and Fez, separated by the river Bouragrag, which
empties itself into the sea between Rabat and Salee; and, indeed, for
several centuries, these districts were separated and governed by
independent princes.Tafilett always, and Sous occasionally, were united
to Morocco, while Fez itself formed a powerful kingdom, extending itself
eastward as far as the gates of Tlemsen.The modern division adopted by several authors, is--

Northern, or the kingdom of Fez.Eastern, or the Province of Tafilett.Some add to this latter, the Province of Draha.Then, a great number of districts are enumerated as comprehended in
these large and general divisions; but the true division of all
Mussulman States is into tribes.There is besides another, which more
approaches to European government, viz, into kaidats, or jurisdictions.The name of a district is usually that of its chief tribe, and mountains
are denominated after the tribes that inhabit them.There is, of course,
a natural division, sometimes called a dividing into zones or specific
regions, which has already been alluded to in enumerating the natural
resources of Morocco, and which besides corresponds with the present
political divisions.I. The North of the Atlas: coming first, the Rif, or mountainous region,
which borders the Mediterranean from the river Moulwia to Tangier,
comprising the districts of Hashbat west, and Gharet and Aklaia east.Then the intermediate zone of plains and hills, which extends from the
middle course of the Moulwia to Tangier on one coast, and to Mogador on
the other.The Central Region, or the great chain of the Atlas.The Deren [17]
of the natives, from the frontiers of Algeria east to Cape Gheer, on the
south-west.This includes the various districts of the Gharb, Temsna,
Beni Hasan, Shawia, Fez, Todla, Dukala, Shragno, Abda, Haha, Shedma,
Khamna, Morocco, &c.

III.South of the Atlas: or quasi-Saharan region, comprising the various
provinces and districts of Sous, Sidi Hisham, Wadnoun, Guezoula, Draha
(Draa), Tafilett, and a large portion of the Sahara, south-east of the
Atlas.As to statistics of population I am inclined fully to admit the
statement of Signor Balbi that, the term of African statistics ought to
be rejected as absurd.Count Hemo de Graeberg, who was a long time Consul
at Tangier, and wrote a statistical and geographical account of the
empire of Morocco, states the number of the inhabitants of the town of
Mazagran to be two thousand.Elton who resided there several months,
assured me it does not contain more than one hundred.Another gentleman
who dwelt there says, three hundred.This case is a fair sample of the
style in which the statistics of population in Morocco are and have been
calculated.Before the occupation of Algeria by the French, all the cities were
vulgarly calculated at double, or treble their amount of population.This has also been the case even in India, where we could obtain, with
care, tolerably correct statistics.The prejudices of oriental and
Africo-eastern people are wholly set against statistics, or numbering
the population.No mother knows the age of her own child.It is
ill-omened, if not an affront, to ask a man how many children he has;
and to demand the amount of the population of a city, is either
constructed as an infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent
Creator, who knows how many people he creates, and how to take care of
them, or it is the question of a spy, who is seeking to ascertain the
strength or weakness of the country.Europeans can, therefore, rarely
obtain any correct statistical information in Morocco: all is proximate
and conjectural.[18] I am anxious, nevertheless, to give some
particulars respecting the population, in order that we may really have
a proximate idea of the strength and resources of this important
country.In describing the towns and cities of the various provinces, I
shall divide them into,

1.Other towns and remarkable places in the interior [19].The towns and ports, on the Mediterranean, are of considerable interest,
but our information is very scanty, except as far as relates to the
_praesidios_ of Spain, or the well-known and much frequented towns of
Tetuan and Tangier.Near the mouth of the Malwia (or fifteen miles distant), is the little
town of Kalat-el-wad, with a castle in which the Governor resides.Whether the river is navigable up to this place, I have not been able to
discover.The water-communication of the interior of North Africa is not
worth the name.Zaffarinds or Jafarines, are three isles lying off the
west of the river Mulweeah, at a short distance, or near its mouth.These belong to Spain, and have recently been additionally fortified,
but why, or for what reason, is not so obvious.Opposite to them, there
is said to be a small town, situate on the mainland.The Spaniards, in
the utter feebleness and decadence of their power, have lately dubbed
some one or other "Captain-general of the Spanish possessions, &c. in
North Africa."Melilla or Melilah is a very ancient city, founded by the Carthaginians,
built near a cape called by the Romans, _Rusadir_ (now Tres-Forcas) the
name afterwards given to the city, and which it still retains in the
form of Ras-ed-Dir, (Head of the mountain).This town is the capital of
the province of Garet, and is said to contain 3,000 souls.It is situate
amidst a vast tract of fine country, abounding in minerals, and most
delicious honey, from which it is pretended the place receives its name.On an isle near, and joined to the mainland by a draw-bridge, is the
Spanish _praesidio_, or convict-settlement called also Melilla,
containing a population of 2,244 according to the Spanish, but Rabbi and
Graeberg do not give it more than a thousand.At a short distance,
towards the east, is an exceedingly spacious bay, of twenty-two miles in
circumference, where, they say, a thousand ships of war could be
anchored in perfect safety, and where the ancient galleys of Venice
carried on a lucrative trade with Fez.Within the bay, three miles
inland, are the ruins of the ancient city of Eazaza, once a celebrated
place.Alhucemos, is another small island and _praesidio_ of the Spaniards,
containing five or six hundred inhabitants; it commands the bay of the
same name, and is situate at the mouth of the river Wad Nechor, where
there is also the Islet of Ed-Housh.Near the bay, is the ancient
capital, Mezemma, now in ruins; it had, however, some commercial
importance in the times of Louis XIV., and carried on trade with France.Penon de Velez is the third _praesidio_-island, a convict settlement of
the Spaniards on this coast, and a very strong position, situate
opposite the mouths of the river Gomera, which disembogues in the
Mediterranean.So
far as natural resources are concerned, Penon de Velez is a mere rock,
and a part of the year is obliged to be supplied with fresh water from
the mainland.Immediately opposite to the continent is the city of
Gomera (or Badis), the ancient Parientina, or perhaps the Acra of
Ptolemy, afterwards called Belis, and by the Spaniards, Velez de la
Gomera.The name Gomera, according to J.A.Conde, is derived from the
celebrated Arab tribe of the Gomeres, who flourished in Africa and Spain
until the last Moorish kings of Granada.Count Graberg pretends Gomera
now contains three thousand inhabitants!whilst other writers, and of
later date, represent this ancient city, which has flourished and played
an important part through many ages, as entirely abandoned, and the
abode of serpents and hyaenas.Gellis is a small port, six miles east of
Velez de Gomera.Tegaza is a small town and port, at two miles or less from the sea near
Pescadores Point, inhabited mostly by fishermen, and containing a
thousand souls.The provinces of Rif and Garet, containing these maritime towns are rich
and highly cultivated, but inhabited by a warlike and semi-barbarous
race of Berbers, over whom the Emperor exercises an extremely precarious
authority.Among these tribes, Abd-el-Kader sought refuge and support
when he was obliged to retire from Algeria, and, where he defied all the
power of the Imperial government for several months.Had the Emir
chosen, he could have remained in Rif till this time; but he determined
to try his strength with the Sultan in a pitch battle, which should
decide his fate.The savage Rifians assemble for barter and trade on market-days, which
are occasions of fierce and incessant quarrels among themselves, when it
is not unusual for two or three persons to be left dead on the spot.Should any unfortunate vessel strike on these coasts, the crew find
themselves in the hands of inhuman wreckers.No European traveller has
ever visited these provinces, and we may state positively that
journeying here is more dangerous than in the farthest wastes of the
Sahara.Spanish renegades, however, are found among them, who have
escaped from the _praesidios_, or penal settlements.The Rif country is
full of mines, and is bounded south by one of the lesser chains of the
Atlas running parallel with the coast.Forests of cork clothe the
mountain-<DW72>s; the Berbers graze their herds and flocks in the deep
green valleys, and export quantities of skins.Tetuan, the Yagath of the Romans, situate at the opening of the Straits
of Gibraltar, four or five miles from the sea, upon the declivity of a
hill and within two small ranges of mountains, is a fine, large, rich
and mercantile city of the province of Hasbat.It has a resident
governor of considerable power and consequence, the name of the present
functionary being Hash-Hash, who has long held the appointment, and
enjoys great influence near the Sultan.Half a mile east of the city
passes from the south Wad Marteen, (the Cus of Marmol) which disembogues
into the sea; on its banks is the little port of Marteen or Marteel, not
quite two miles distant from the coast, and about three from the city,
where a good deal of commerce is carried on, small vessels, laden with
the produce of Barbary, sailing thence to Spain, Gibraltar, and even
France and Italy.The population of Tetouan is from nine to twelve
thousand souls, including, besides Moors and Arabs, four thousand Jews,
two thousand <DW64>s, and eight thousand Berbers.The streets are
generally formed into arcades, or covered bazaars.The Jews have a separate quarter; their women are celebrated for their
beauty.The suburbs are adorned with fine gardens, and olive and vine
plantations.Orange groves, or rather orange forests, extend for miles
around, yielding their golden treasures.A great export of oranges could
be established here, which might be conveyed overland to India.Altogether, Tetuan is one of the most respectable coast-cities of
Morocco, though it has no port immediately adjoining it.Its
fortifications are only strong enough to resist the attack of hostile
Berbers.The town is about two-thirds of a day's journey from Tangier,
south-east.A fair day's journey would be, in Morocco, upwards of thirty
English miles, but a good deal depends upon the season of the year when
you travel.Ceuta is considered to be Esilissa of Ptolemy, and was once the capital
of Mauritania Tingitana.The Arabs call it Sebat and Sebta, _i.e._,
"seven," after the Romans, who called it _Septem fratres_, and the
Greeks the same, apparently on account of the seven mountains, which are
in the neighbourhood.Ceuta, or Sebta, is evidently the modern form of
this classic name.It is a very ancient city and celebrated fortress,
situate fourteen miles south of Gibraltar, nearly opposite to it, as a
species of rival stronghold, and placed upon a peninsula, which detaches
itself from the continent on the east, and turns then to the north.The
city extends over the tongue of land nearest the continent; the citadel
occupies Monte-del-Acho, called formerly Jibel-el-Mina, a name still
preserved in Almina, a suburb to the south-east.In the beginning of the eighth century, Ceuta, which was inhabited by
the Goths, passed into the hands of the Arabs, who made it a point of
departure for the expeditions into Spain.It was conquered by the
powerful Arab family of the Ben-Hamed, one of whom, called Mohammed
Edris, invaded Spain, and, after several conquests, was proclaimed King
of Cordova, in A.D.1,000,

On 21st of August, 1415, the Portuguese conquered it, and it was the
first place which they occupied in Africa.In 1578, at the death of Don
Sebastian, Ceuta passed with Portugal and the rest of the colonies into
the power of Spain; and when, in 1640, the Portuguese recovered their
independence, the Spaniards were left masters of Ceuta, which continues
still in their hands, but is of no utility to them except as a
_praesidio_, which makes the fourth penal settlement possessed by them
on this coast.Ceuta contains a garrison of two or three thousand men.The free
population amounts to some five or six thousand.It has a small and
insecure port.Here is the famed Gibel Zaterit, "Monkey's promontory,"
or "Ape's Hill," which has occasioned the ingenious fable, that,
inasmuch as there are no monkeys in any part of Europe except Gibraltar,
directly opposite to this rock, where also monkeys are found, there must
necessarily be a subterranean passage beneath the sea, by which they
pass and re-pass to opposite sides of the Straits, and maintain a
friendly and uninterrupted intercourse between the brethren of Africa
and Europe.Anciently, the mountains hereabouts formed the African
pillars of Hercules opposite to Gibraltar, which may be considered the
European pillar of that respectable hero of antiquity.Passing Tangier after a day's journey, we come to Arzila or Asila, in
the province of Hasbat, which is an ancient Berber city, and which, when
conquered by the Romans, was named first Zilia and afterwards Zulia,
_Constantia Zilis_.It is placed on the naked shores of the Atlantic,
and has a little port.Whilst possessed by the Portuguese, it was a
place of considerable strength, but its fortifications being, as usual,
neglected by the Moors, are now rapidly decaying.[20] The population is
about one thousand.The next
town on the Atlantic, after another day's journey southwards, is El
Araish, _i.e._, the trellices of vines; vulgarly called Laratsh.This
city replaces the ancient Liscas or Lixus and Lixa, whose ruins are
near.The Arabs call it El-Araish Beai-Arous, _i.e._, the vineyards of
the Beni-Arous, a powerful tribe, who populate the greater part of the
district of Azgar, of which it is the capital and the residence of the
Governor.It was, probably, built by this tribe about 1,200 or 1,300,
AD.El-Araish contains a population of 2,700 Moors, and 1,300 Jews, or
4,000 souls; but others give only 2,000 for the whole amount, of which
250 are Jews.The town is situate upon
a small promontory stretching into the sea, and along the mouth of the
river Cos, or Luccos (Loukkos), which forms a secure port, but of so
difficult access, that vessels of two hundred tons can scarcely enter
it.In winter, the roadstead is very bad; [21] the houses are
substantially built; and the fortifications are good, because made by
the Spaniards, who captured this place in 1610, but it was re-taken by
Muley Ishmael in 1689.In the
environs, cotton is cultivated, and charcoal is made from the Araish
forest of cork-trees.El-Araish exports cork, wool, skins, bark, beans,
and grain, and receives in exchange iron, cloth, cottons, muslins, sugar
and tea.The lions and panthers of the mountains of Beni Arasis
sometimes descend to the plains to drink, or carry off a supper of a
sheep or bullock.Azgar, the name of this district, connects it with one
of the powerful tribes of the Touaricks; and, probably, a section of
this tribe of Berbers were resident here at a very early period (at the
same time the Berber term _ayghar_ corresponds to the Arabic _bahira_,
and signifies "plain.")The ancient Lixus deserves farther mention on account of the interest
attached to its coins, a few of which remain, although but very recently
deciphered by archeologists.There are five classes of them, and all
Phoenician, although the city now under Roman rule, represents the
vineyard riches of this part of ancient Mauritania by two bunches of
grapes, so that, after nearly three thousand years, the place has
retained its peculiarity of producing abundant vines, El-Araish, being
"the vine trellices;" others have stamped on them "two ears of corn" and
"two fishes," representing the fields of corn waving on the plains of
Morocco, and the fish (shebbel especially) which fills its northern
rivers.Strabo says:--"Mauritania generally, excepting a small part desert, is
rich and fertile, well watered with rivers and washed with lakes;
abounding in all things, and producing trees of great dimensions."Another writer adds "this country produces a species of the vine whose
trunk the extended arms of two men cannot embrace, and which yields
grapes of a cubit's length.""At this city," says Pliny, "was the palace
of Antaeus, and his combat with Hercules and the gardens of Hesperides."Mehedia or Mamora, and sometimes, Nuova Mamora, is situate upon the
north-western <DW72> of a great hill, some four feet above the sea, upon
the left bank of the mouth of the Sebon, and at the edge of the
celebrated plain and forest of Mamora, belonging to the province of
Beni-Hassan.According to Marmol, Mamora was built by Jakob-el-Mansour
to defend the embouchure of the river.It was captured by the Spaniards
in 1614, and retaken by the Moors in 1681.The Corsairs formerly took
refuge here.It is now a weak and miserable place, commanded by an old
crumbling-down castle.There are five or six hundred fishermen,
occupying one hundred and fifty cabins, who make a good trade of the
Shebbel salmon; it has a very small garrison.The forest of Mamora,
contains about sixty acres of fine trees, among which are some splendid
oaks, all suitable for naval construction.Salee or Sala, a name which this place bore antecedently to the Roman
occupation, is a very ancient city, situate upon the right bank of the
river Bouragrag, and near its mouth.This place was captured in 1263, by
Alphonso the Wise, King of Castille, who was a short time after
dispossessed of his conquest by the King of Fez; and the Moorish Sultans
have kept it to the present time, though the city itself has often
attempted to throw off the imperial yoke.The modern Salee is a large
commercial and well-fortified city of the province of Beni-Hassan.Its
port is sufficiently large, but, on account of the little depth of
water, vessels of large burden cannot enter it.The houses and public
places are tolerably well-built.The town is fortified by a battery of
twenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the sea, and a redoubt at the
entrance of the river.What navy the Maroquines have, is still laid up
here, but the dock-yard is now nearly deserted, and the few remaining
ships are unserviceable.The population, all of whom are Mahometans, are
now, as in Corsair times, the bitterest and most determined enemies of
Christians, and will not permit a Christian or Jew to reside among them.The amount of this population, and that of Rabat, is thus given,

  _Salee Rabat_
  Graeberg         23,000    27,000
  Washington       9,000    21,000
  Arlett          14,000    24,000

but it is probably greatly exaggerated.A resident of this country reduces the population of Salee as low as two
or three thousand.For many years, the port of Salee was the rendezvous
of the notorious pirates of Morocco, who, together with the city of
Rabat, formed a species of military republic almost independent of the
Sultan; these Salee rovers were at once the most ferocious and
courageous in the world.Time was, when these audacious freebooters lay
under Lundy Island in the British Channel, waiting to intercept British
traders!"Salee," says Lempriere, "was a place of good commerce, till,
addicting itself entirely to piracy, and revolting from the allegiance
to its Sovereign, Muley Zidan, that prince in the year 1648, dispatched
an embassy to King Charles 1, of England, requesting him to send a
squadron of men-of-war to lie before the town, while he attacked by
land."This request being acceded to, the city was soon reduced, the
fortifications demolished, and the leaders of the rebellion put to
death.The year following, the Emperor sent another ambassador to
England, with a present of Barbary horses and three hundred Christian
slaves.Rabat, or Er-Rabat, and on some of the foreign maps Nuova Sale, is a
modern city of considerable extent, densely populated, strong and
well-built, belonging to the province of Temsna.It is situated on the
declivity of a hill, opposite to Salee, on the other side of the river,
or left side of the Bouragrag, which is as broad as the Thames at
London Bridge, and might be considered as a great suburb, or another
quarter of the same city.It was built by the famous Yakob-el-Mansour,
nephew of Abd-el-Moumen, and named by him Rabat-el-Fatah, _i.e._, "camp
of victory," by which name it is now often mentioned.The walls of Rabat enclose a large space of ground, and the town is
defended on the seaside by three forts, erected some years ago by an
English renegade, and furnished with ordnance from Gibraltar.Among the
population are three or four thousand Jews, some of them of great wealth
and consequence.The merchants are active and intelligent, carrying on
commerce with Fez, and other places of the interior, as also with the
foreign ports of Genoa, Gibraltar, and Marseilles.In the middle ages,
the Genoese had a great trade with Rabat, but this trade is now removed
to Mogador, Many beautiful gardens and plantations adorn the suburbs,
deserving even the name of "an earthly paradise."The Moors of Rabat are mostly from Spain, expelled thence by the
Spaniards.The famous Sultan, Almanzor, intended that Rabat should be
his capital.His untenanted mausoleum is placed here, in a separate and
sacred quarter.This prince, surnamed "the victorious," (Elmansor,) was
he who expelled the Moravedi from Spain.He is the Nero of Western
Africa, as Keatinge says, their "King Arthur."Tradition has it that
Elmansor went in disguise to Mecca, and returned no more.Mankind love
this indefinite and obscure end of their heroes.Moses went up to the
mountain to die there in eternal mystery.At a short distance from Rabat
is Shella, or its ruins, a small suburb situated on the summit of a
hill, which contains the tombs of the royal family of the Beni-Merini,
and the founder of Rabat, and is a place of inviolate sanctity, no
infidel being permitted to enter therein.Monsieur Chenier supposes
Shella to have been the site of the metropolis of the Carthaginian
colonies.Of these two cities, on the banks of the Wad-Bouragrag, Salee was,
according to D'Anville, always a place of note as at the present time,
and the farthest Roman city on the coast of the Atlantic, being the
frontier town of the ancient Mauritania Tingitana.Some pretend that all
the civilization which has extended itself beyond this point is either
Moorish, or derived from European colonists.The river Wad-Bouragrag is
somewhat a natural line of demarcation, and the products and animals of
the one side differ materially from those of the other, owing to the
number and less rapid descent of the streams on the side of the north,
and so producing more humidity, whilst the south side, on the contrary,
is of a higher and drier soil.Fidallah, or Seid Allah, _i.e_., "grace," or "gift of God," is a
maritime village of the province of Temsa, founded by the Sultan
Mohammed in 1773.It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.Fidallah is situated on a vast plain, near the river Wad Millah, where
there is a small port, or roadstead, to which the corsairs were wont to
resort when they could not reach Salee, long before the village was
built, called Mersa Fidallah.The place contains a thousand souls,
mostly in a wretched condition.Sidi Mohammed, before he built Mogador,
had the idea of building a city here; the situation is indeed
delightful, surrounded with fertility.Dar-el-Beida (or Casa-Blanco, "white house,") is a small town, formerly
in possession of the Portuguese, who built it upon the ruins of Anfa or
Anafa, [22] which they destroyed in 1468.They, however, scarcely
finished it when they abandoned it in 1515.Dar-el-Beida is situate on
the borders of the fertile plains of the province of Shawiya, and has a
small port, formed by a river and a spacious bay on the Atlantic.The
Romans are said to have built the ancient Anafa, in whose time it was a
considerable place, but now it scarcely contains above a thousand
inhabitants, and some reduce them to two hundred.Sidi Mohammed
attempted this place, and the present Sultan endeavoured to follow up
these efforts.A little commerce with Europe is carried on here.The bay
will admit of vessels of large burden anchoring in safety, except when
the wind blows strong from the north-west.Casa Blanco is two days
journey from Rabat, and two from Azamor, or Azemmour, which is an
ancient and fine city of the province of Dukaila, built by the Amazigh
Berbers, in whose language it signifies "olives."It is situate upon a
hill, about one hundred feet above the sea, and distant half a mile from
the shore, not far from the mouth of the Wad-Omm-er-Rbia (or Omm-Erbegh)
on its southern bank, and is everywhere surrounded by a most fertile
soil.Azamor contains now about eight or nine hundred inhabitants, but
formerly was much more populated.The Shebbel salmon is the principal
commerce, and a source of immense profit to the town.The river is very
deep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and
dangerous.It is frequently of a red colour, and charged with slime like
the Nile at the period of its inundations.The tide is felt five or six
leagues up the river, according to Chenier.Formerly, vessels of every
size entered the river, but now its mouth has a most difficult bar of
sand, preventing large vessels going up, like nearly all the Maroquine
ports situate on the mouths, or within the rivers.Azamor was taken by the Portuguese under the command of the Duke of
Braganza in 1513 who strengthened it by fortifications, the walls of
which are still standing; but it was abandoned a century afterwards, the
Indies having opened a more lucrative field of enterprise than these
barren though honourable conquests on the Maroquine coast.This place is
half a day's journey, or about fourteen miles from Mazagran, _i.the
above Amayeeghs, an extremely ancient and strong castle, erected on a
peninsula at the bottom of a spacious and excellent bay.It was rebuilt
by the Portuguese in 1506, who gave it the name of Castillo Real.The
site has been a centre of population from the remotest period, chiefly
Berbers, whose name it still bears.The Arabs, however, call it
El-Bureeja, i.e., "the citadel."The Portuguese abandoned it in 1769;
Mazagran was the last stronghold which they possessed in Morocco.The
town is well constructed, and has a wall twelve feet thick, strengthened
with bastions.There is a small port, or dock, on the north side of the
town, capable of admitting small vessels, and the roadstead is good,
where large vessels can anchor about two miles off the shore.Its
traffic is principally with Rabat, but there is also some export trade
to foreign parts.[23] After
proceeding two days south-west, you arrive at Saffee, or properly
Asafee, called by the natives Asfee, and anciently Soffia or Saffia, is
a city of great antiquity, belonging to the province of Abda, and was
built by the Carthaginians near Cape Pantin.Its site lies between two
hills, in a valley which is exposed to frequent inundations.The
roadstead of Saffee is good and safe during summer, and its shipping
once enabled it to be the centre of European commerce on the Atlantic
coast.The population amounts to about one thousand, including a number
of miserable Jews.The walls of Saffee are massy and high.The
Portuguese captured this city in 1508, voluntarily abandoning it in
1641.The country around is not much cultivated, and presents melancholy
deserts; but there is still a quantity of corn grown.About forty miles
distant, S.E., is a large salt lake.Saffee is one and a half day's
journey from Mogador.Equidistant between Mazagran and Saffee is the small town of El-Waladia,
situate on an extensive plain.Persons report that near this spot is a
spacious harbour, or lagune, sufficiently capacious to contain four or
five hundred sail of the line; but, unfortunately, the entrance is
obstructed by some rocks, which, however, it is added, might easily be
blown up.The lagune is also exposed to winds direct for the ocean.The
town, enclosed within a square wall, and containing very few
inhabitants, is supposed to have been built in the middle of the
seventeenth century by the Sultan Waleed.This brings us to Mogador, which, with Aghadir, have already been
described.CHAPTER V.

Description of the Imperial Cities or Capitals of the Empire.--
El-Kesar.--Mequinez.--Fez.--Morocco.--The province of Tafilett, the
birth-place of the present dynasty of the Shereefs.The royal or capitals of the interior now demand our attention, which
are El-Kesar, Mequinez, Fez, and Morocco.El-Kesar, or Al-Kesar, [24] styled also El-Kesue-Kesar, is so named and
distinguished because it owes its enlargement to the famous Sultan of
Fez, Almansor, who improved and beautified it about the year 1180, and
designed this city as a magazine and rendezvous of troops for the great
preparations he was making at the time for the conquest of Granada.El-Kesar is in the province of the Gharb, and situate on the southern
bank of the Luccos; here is a deep and rapid stream, flowing W.The town is nearly as large as Tetuan, but the streets are dirty and
narrow, and many of the houses in a ruinous condition, This fortified
place was once adorned by some fifteen mosques, but only two or three
are now fit for service.The population does not exceed four or five
thousand souls, and some think this number over-estimated.The surrounding country is flat meadowland, but flooded after the rains,
and producing fatal fevers, though dry and hot enough in summer.The
suburban fields are covered with gardens and orchards.It was at
El-Kesar, where, in A.D.1578, the great battle of The Three Kings came
off, because, besides the Portuguese King, Don Sebastian, two Moorish
princes perished on this fatal day.But one of them, Muley Moluc, died
very ill in a litter, and was not killed in the fight; his death,
however, was kept a secret till the close of the battle, in order that
the Moors might not be discouraged.With their prince, Don Sebastian,
perished the flower of the Portuguese nobility and chivalry of that
time.War, indeed, was found "a dangerous game" on that woeful day: both
for princes and nobles, and many a poor soul was swept away

  "Floating in a purple tide."But the "trade of war" has been carried on ever since, and these
lessons, written in blood, are as useless to mankind as those dashed off
by the harmless pen of the sentimental moralist.El-Kesar is placed in
Latitude, 35 deg.1 10" N.; Longitude, 5 deg.49' 30" W.

Mequinez, [25] in Arabic, Miknas (or Miknasa), is a royal residence, and
city of the province of Fez, situate upon a hill in the midst of a
well-watered and most pleasant town, blessed with a pure and serene air.The city of Miknas is both large and finely built, of considerable
interest and of great antiquity.It was founded by the tribe of Berbers
Meknasab, a fraction of the Zenatah, in the middle of the tenth century,
and called Miknasat, hence is derived its present name.The modern town
is surrounded with a triple wall thirteen feet high and three thick,
enclosing a spacious area.This wall is mounted with batteries to awe
the Berbers of the neighbouring mountains.The population amounts to
about twenty thousand souls, (some say forty or fifty thousand) in which
are included about nine thousand <DW64> troops, constituting the greater
portion of the Imperial guard.Two thousand of these black troops are in
charge of the royal treasures, estimated at some fifty millions of
dollars, and always increasing.These treasures consist of jewels, bars
of gold and silver, and money in the two precious metals, the greater
part being Spanish and Mexican dollars.The inhabitants are represented as being the most polished of the Moors,
kind and hospitable to strangers.The palace of the Emperor is extremely
simple and elegant, all the walls of which are _embroidered_ with the
beautiful stucco-work of Arabesque patterns, as pure and chaste as the
finest lace.The marble for the pillars was furnished from the ruins
adjacent, called Kesar Faraoun, "Castle of Pharoah" (a name given to
most of the old ruins of Morocco, of whose origin there is any doubt).During the times of piracy, there was here, as also at Morocco, a
Spanish hospitium for the ransom and recovery of Christian slaves.Even
before Mequinez was constituted a royal city, it was a place of
considerable trade and riches.Nothing of any peculiar value has been
discovered among the extensive and ancient ruins about a mile distant,
and which have furnished materials for the building of several royal
cities; they are, however, supposed to be Roman.Scarcely a day's
journey separates Mequinez from Fez.It is not usual for two royal
cities to be placed so near together, but which must render their
fortunes inseparable.According to some, the name Fas, which signifies in Arabia
a pickaxe, was given to it because one was found in digging its
foundations.Others derive it from Fetha, silver.It is no longer the
marvellous city described by Leo Africanus, yet its learning, wealth,
and industry place it in the first rank of the cities of Morocco.During
the eighth century, the Arabs, masters of Tunis, of all Algeria, and the
maritime cities of Morocco, seemed to think only of invading Europe and
consolidating their power in Spain; but at this epoch, a descendant of
Ali and Fatima, Edris Ben Abdalluh, quitted Arabia, passed into Morocco,
and established himself at Oualili, the capital, where he remained till
his death, and where he was buried.His character was generally known
and venerated for its sanctity, and drew upon him the affectionate
regard of the people, and all instinctively placed themselves near him
as a leader of the Faithful, likely to put an end to anarchy, and
establish order in the Mussulman world.His son, Edris-Ben-Edris, who
inherited his virtues and influence, offering a species of ancient
prototype to Abd-el Kader and his venerable father, Mahadin, was the
first _bona-fide_ Mussulman sovereign of the Maroquine empire, and
founded Fez.Fez is a most ancient centre of population, and had long been a famed
city, before Muley Edris, in the year A.D.807 (others in 793), gave it
its present form and character.From that period, however, Fez [26] dates its modern celebrity and rank
among the Mahometan capitals of the world, and especially as being the
second city of Islamism, and the "palace of the Mussulmen Princes of the
West."That the Spanish philologists should make Fut, of the Prophet
Nahum, to be the ancient capital of Fez, is not remarkable, considering
the numerous bands of emigrants, who, emerging from the coast, wandered
as far as the pillars of Hercules; and, besides, in a country like North
Africa, the theatre of so many revolutions, almost every noted city of
the present period has had its ancient form, from which it has been
successively changed.The modern capital is placed in a valley upon the gentle <DW72> of
several hills by which it is surrounded, and whose heights are crowned
with lovely gardens breathing odoriferous sweets.Close by is a little
river, or a branch of the Tebou, named Wad-el-Juhor, or "streamlet,"
which supplies the city with excellent water.The present buildings are divided into old and new Fez.The streets are
so narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely ride abreast; they
are, besides, very dark, and often arched over.Colonel Scott represents
some of the streets, however, as a mile in length.The houses are high,
but not handsome.The shops are numerous and much frequented, though not
very fine in appearance.Fez contains no less than seven hundred
mosques, fifty of which are superb, and ornamented with fine columns of
marble; there is, besides, a hundred or more of very small and ill-built
mosques, or rather, houses of prayer.The most famous of these temples
of worship is El-Karoubin (or El-Karouiin), supported by three hundred
pillars.In this is preserved the celebrated library of antiquity,
where, it is pretended, ancient Greek and Latin authors are to be found
in abundance with the lost books of Titus Livy.[27] But the mosque the more
frequented and venerated, is that dedicated to the founder of the city,
Muley Edris, whose ashes repose within its sacred enclosure.So
excessive is this "hero-worship" for this great sultan, that the people
constantly invoke his name in their prayers instead of that of the
Deity.The mausoleum of this sacro-santo prince is inviolable and
unapproachable.The university of Fez was formally much celebrated, but
little of its learning now remains.Its once high-minded orthodox mulahs
are now succeeded by a fanatic and ignorant race of marabouts.Nevertheless, the few _hommes de lettres_ found in Morocco are
congregated here, and the literature of the empire is concentrated in
this city.Seven large public schools are in full activity, besides
numbers of private seminaries of instruction.The low humour of the
talebs, and the fanaticism of the people, are unitedly preserved and
developed in this notorious doggerel couplet, universally diffused
throughout Morocco:--

  _Ensara fee Senara
  Elhoud fee Sefoud_

  "Christians on the hook
  Jews on the spit," or

  "Let Christians be hooked,
  And let Jews be cooked."The great division of the Arabic into eastern and western dialects makes
little real difference in a practical point of view.The Mogrebbin, or
western, is well understood by all travellers, and, of course, by all
scholars from the East.The palace of the Sultan is not large, but is handsome.There are
numerous baths, and an hospital for the mad or incurable.The population
was estimated, not long ago, at 88,000 souls, of which there were 60,000
Moors and Arabs (the Moors being chiefly immigrants from Spain), 10,000
Berbers, 8,000 Jews, and 10,000 <DW64>s.But this amount has been
reduced to 40,000, or even 30,000; and the probability is, the present
population of Fez does not by any means, exceed 50,000, if it reaches
that number.Nearly all the Jews reside in the new city, which, by its
position, dominates the old one.The inhabitants of Fez, in spite of
their learning and commerce, are distinguished for their fanaticism; and
an European, without an escort of troops, cannot walk in the streets
unless disguised.It was lately the head-quarters of the fanatics who
preached "the holy war," and involved the Emperor in hostilities with
the French.The immense trade of every kind carried on at Fez gives it almost the
air of an European city.In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is
exhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole
world.The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair.Fez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or
Timbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims.The two
great stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett
and Touat.The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days.The Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then
turns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to
Alexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months.All
depends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the
caravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest
caravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half,
or one hundred days.The value of the investments in this caravan has
been estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of
the Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life
that now is, as well as in that which is to come.Fez is surrounded with a vast wall, but which is in decay.It applies almost to every Moorish city and public building in
North Africa.And yet the faith of the false prophet is as strong as
ever, and with time and hoary age seems to strike its roots deeper into
the hearts of its simple, but enthusiastic and duped devotees!The city has seven gates, and two castles, at the east and west, form
its main defence.These castles are very ancient, and are formed and
supported by square walls about sixty feet in front, Ali Bey says,
subterraneous passages are reported to exist between these castles and
the city; and, whenever the people revolt against the Sultan, cannon are
planted on the castles with a few soldiers as their guard.The
fortifications, or Bastiles, of Paris, we see, therefore, were no new
invention of Louis Philippe to awe the populace.The maxims of a subtle
policy are instructive in despotism of every description.The constituted authorities of Fez are like those of every city of
Morocco.The Governor is the lieutenant of the sovereign, exercising the
executive power; the Kady, or supreme judge, is charged with the
administration of the law, and the Al-Motassen fixes the price of
provisions, and decides all the questions of trade and customs.There
are but few troops at Fez, for it is not a strong military possession;
on the contrary, it is commanded by accessible heights and is exposed to
a _coup-de-main_.Fez, indeed, could make no _bona-fide_ resistance to an European army.The manufactures are principally woollen haiks, silk handkerchiefs,
slippers and shoes of excellent leather, and red caps of felt, commonly
called the fez; the first fabrication of these red caps appears to have
been in this city.The Spanish Moorish immigrants introduced the mode of
dressing goat and sheep-skins, at first known by the name of Cordovan
from Cordova; but, since the Moorish forced immigration, they have
acquired the celebrated name of Morocco.The chief food of the people is
the national Moorish dish of _cuscasou_, a fine grained paste, cooked by
steam, with melted fat, oil, or other liquids poured upon the dish, and
sometimes garnished with pieces of fowl and other meat.A good deal of
animal food is consumed, but few vegetables.The climate is mild in the
winter, but suffocating with heat in the summer.This city is placed in
latittude 34 deg.6' 3" N. longitude 4 deg.Morocco, or strictly in Arabic, _Maraksh_, which signifies "adorned,"
is the capital of the South, and frequently denominated the capital of
the Empire, but it is only a _triste_ shadow of its former greatness.It
is sometimes honoured with the title of "the great city," or "country."Morocco occupies an immense area of ground, being seven miles in
circumference, the interior of which is covered with heaps of ruins or
more pleasantly converted into gardens.Morocco was built in 1072 or
1073 by the famous Yousel-Ben-Tashfin, King of Samtuna, and of the
dynasty of the Almoravedi, or Marabouts.Its site is that of an ancient
city, Martok, founded in the remotest periods of the primitive Africans,
or aboriginal Berbers, in whose language it signifies a place where
everything good and pleasant was to be found in abundance.Bocanum Hermerum of the Ancients was also near the site of this capital,
Morocco attained its greatest prosperity shortly after its foundation,
and since then it has only declined.In the twelfth century, under the
reign of Jakoub Almanzor, there were 10,000 houses and 700,000 souls,
(if indeed we can trust their statistics); but, at the present time,
there are only some forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, including 4,000
Shelouhs and 5,000 Jews.Ali Bey, in 1804, estimates its population at
only 30,000, and Captain Washington in 1830 at 80, or 100,000.This vast
city lies at the foot of the Atlas, or about fourteen miles distant,
spread over a wide and most lovely plain of the province of Rhamma,
watered by the river Tensift, six miles from the gates of the capital.The mosques are numerous and rich, the principal of which are
El-Kirtubeeah, of elegant architecture with an extremely lofty minaret;
El-Maazin, which is three hundred years old, and a magnificent building;
and Benious, built nearly seven hundred years ago of singular
construction, uniting modern and ancient architecture.The mosque of the
patron saint is Sidi Belabbess.Nine gates open in the city-walls; these
are strong and high, and flanked with towers, except on the south east
where the Sultan's palace stands.The streets are crooked, of uneven
width, unpaved, and dirty in winter, and full of dust in summer.The Kaessaria, or
commercial quarter, is extensive, exhibiting every species of
manufacture and natural product.The manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally,
silks, embroidery, and leather.The merchants of Mogador have magazines
here; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior,
passing through Wadnoun to the south.The Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls.There are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives
his merchants and the diplomatic agents.The air of the country, at the
foot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious.The city is well supplied
with water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which
flows from the gorges of the Atlas.But the inhabitants, although they
enjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous
for their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character,
still must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a
very low ebb.Its interior wears a deeply dejected, nay a profoundly
gloomy aspect."Horrendum incultumque specus."and the European merchants, when they come up here are glad to get away
as soon as possible.Outside the city, there is a suburb appropriated to lepers, a
Lazar-house of leprosy, which afflicting and loathsome disease descends
from father to son through unbroken generations; the afflicted cannot
enter the city, and no one dare approach their habitations.The Emperor
usually resides for a third portion of his time at Morocco the rest at
Fez and Mequinez.Whenever his Imperial Highness has anything
disagreeable with foreign European powers, he comes down from Fez to
Morocco, to get out of the way.Occasionally, he travels from town to
town of the interior, to awe by his presence the ever restless
disaflfection of the tribes, or excite their loyalty for the Shereefian
throne.35" 30', W.

Tafilett consists of a group of towns or villages, situate on the
south-eastern side of the Atlas, which may he added to the royal cities,
being inhabited in part by the Imperial family, and is the birth-place
of their sovereign power--emphatically called Beladesh-Sherfa, "country
of the Shereefs."The country was anciently called Sedjelmasa, and
retained this name up to 1530 A.D., when the principal city acquired the
apellation of Tafilett, said to be derived from an Arab immigrant,
called Filal, who improved the culture of dates, and whose name on this
account, under the Berber form of Tafilett, was given to a plantation of
dates cultivated by him, and then passed to the surrounding districts.At the present time, Tafilett consists of a group of fortified or
castle-built villages, environed by walls mounted with square towers,
which extend on both sides of the river Zig.There is also a castle, or
rather small town, upon the left side of the river, called by the
ordinary name of Kesar, which is in the hands of the Shereefs, and
inhabited entirely by the family of the Prophet.The principal and most
flourishing place was a long time called Tafilett, but is now according
to Callie, Ghourlan, and the residence of the Governor of the province
of Ressant, a town distinguished by a magnificent gateway surrounded
with various  Dutch tiles, symmetrically arranged in a diamond
pattern.This traveller calls the district of Tafilett, Afile or Afilel.It is probable that from the rains of the ancient Sedjelmasa, some of
the modern villages have been constructed.The towns and districts of
Tafilett once formed an independent kingdom.The present population has
been estimated at some ten thousand, but this is entirely conjectural.Callie mentions the four towns of Ghourlan, L'Eksebi, Sosso and Boheim
as containing eleven or twelve thousand souls.The soil of Tafilett is
level, composed of sand of an ashy grey, productive of corn, and all
sorts of European fruits and vegetables.The natives have fine sheep,
with remarkably white wool.The manufactures, which are in woollen and
silk, are called Tafiletes.Besides being a rendezvous of caravans, radiating through all parts of
the Sahara, Tafilett is a great mart of traffic in the natural products
of the surrounding countries.A fine bridge spans the Zig, built by a
Spaniard.When the Sultan of Morocco finds any portion of his family
inclined to be naughty, he sends them to Tafilett, as we are wont to
send troublesome people to "Jericho."This, at any rate, is better than
cutting off their heads, which, from time immemorial, has been the
invariable practice of African and Oriental despots.The Maroquine
princes may be thankful they have Tafilett as a place of exile.The
Emperors never visit Tafilett except as dethroned exiles.A journey to
such a place is always attended with danger; and were the Sultan to
escape, he would find, on his return, the whole country in revolt.Regarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations.The destinies
of Fez and Mequinez are inseparable.United, they contain one hundred
thousand inhabitants, the most polished and learned in the Empire.Fez
is the city of arts and learning, that is of what remains of the once
famous and profound Moorish doctors of Spain.Mequinez is the strong
place of the Empire, an emporium of arms and imperial Cretsures.The two cities are the capitals of two kingdoms,
never yet amalgamated.The present dynasty belongs not to Fez, but to
Morocco; though a dynasty of Shereefs, they are Shereefs of the south,
and African blood flows in their veins.The Sultan generally is obliged to give a preference to Fez for a
residence, because his presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance
of the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty, his son in the
meanwhile being left Governor during his absence.But all these royal
cities are on the decline, the "sere and yellow leaf" of a well nigh
defunct civilization.Morocco is a huge shell of its former greatness, a
monster of Moresque dilapidations.France may awaken the slumbering
energies of the population of these once flourishing and august cities,
but left to themselves they are powerless, sinking under their own
weight and uncouth encumbrances, and will rise no more till
reconstructed by European hands.Description of the towns and cities of the Interior, and those of the

population.--The Maroquine Sahara.We have briefly to notice the remaining towns and cities of the
interior, with some other remarkable places.First, these distinguished and well ascertained places in the kingdom of
Fez.Seisouan, or Sousan, is the capital of the Rif province, situate also on
the borders of the province of the Habat, and by the sources of a little
river which runs into the Mediterranean, near Cape Mazari.The town is
small, but full of artizans and merchants.The country around is
fertile, being well irrigated with streams.Sousan is the most
beautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range.Sofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon
the river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines
of fossil salt.Wazen, or Wazein, in the province of Azgar, and the region of the Gharb,
is a small city without Walls, celebrated for being the residence of
the High Priest, or Grand Marabout of the Empire.This title is
hereditary, and is now (or up to lately) possessed by the famous
Sidi-el-Haj-el-Araby-Ben-Ali, who, in his district, lives in a state of
nearly absolute independence, besides exercising great influence over
public affairs.This saint, or priest, has, however, a rival at Tedda.The two popes together pretend to decide the fate of the Empire.The
districts where these Grand Marabouts reside, are without governors,
and the inhabitants pay no tribute into the imperial coffers, they are
ruled by their two priests under a species of theocracy.The Emperor
never attempts or dares to contest their privileges.Occasionally they
appear abroad, exciting the people, and declaiming against the vices of
the times.His Moorish Majesty then feels himself ill at ease, until
they retire to their sanctuaries, and employs all his arts to effect
the object, protesting that he will be wholly guided by their councils
in the future administration of the Empire.With this humiliation of
the Shereefs, they are satisfied, and kennel themselves into their
sanctum-sanctorums.Zawiat-Muley-Driss, which means, retirement of our master, Lord Edris
(Enoch) and sometimes called Muley Edris, is a far famed city of the
province of Fez, and placed at the foot of the lofty mountains of
Terhoun, about twenty-eight miles from Fez, north-west, amidst a most
beautiful country, producing all the necessaries and luxuries of human
life.The site anciently called Tuilet, was perhaps also the Volubilis
of the ancients.Here is a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of Edris,
progenitor and founder of the dynasty of Edrisiti.The population, given by Graeberg, is nine thousand, but this is
evidently exaggerated.Not far off, towards the west, are some
magnificent ruins of an ancient city, called Kesar Faraoun, or "Castle
of Pharoah."Dubdu, called also Doubouton, is an ancient, large city, of the district
of Shaous, and once the residence of an independent prince, but now
fallen into decay on account of the sterility of its site, which is upon
the sides of a barren mountain.Dubdu is three days' journey southeast
of Fez, and one day from Taza, in the region of the Mulweeah.Taza is
the capital of the well-watered district of Haiaina, and one of the
finest cities in Morocco, in a most romantic situation, placed on a rock
which is shaped like an island, and in presence of the lofty mountains
of Zibel Medghara, to the south-west.Perhaps it is the Babba of the
ancients; a river runs round the town.The houses and streets are
spacious, and there is a large mosque.The air is pure, and provisions
are excellent.The population is estimated at ten or twelve thousand,
who are hospitable, and carry on a good deal of commerce with Tlemsen
and Fez.Taza is two days from Fez, and four from Oushda.Oushda is the well-known frontier town, on the north-east, which
acquired some celebrity during the late war.It is enclosed by the walls
of its gardens, and is protected by a large fortress.The place contains
a population of from six hundred to one thousand Moors and Arabs.There
is a mosque, as well as three chapels, dedicated to Santous.The houses,
built of clay, are low and of a wretched appearance; the streets are
winding, and covered with flints.The fortress, where the Kaed resides,
is guarded in ordinary times by a dozen soldiers; but, were this force
increased, it could not be defended, in consequence of its dilapidated
condition.A spring of excellent water, at a little distance from
Oushda, keeps up the whole year round freshness and verdure in the
gardens, by means of irrigation.Oushda is a species of oasis of the Desert of Angad, and the aridity of
the surrounding country makes these gardens appear delicious, melons,
olives, and figs being produced in abundance.The distance between Tlemsen and Oushda is sixteen leagues, or about
sixteen hours' march for troops; Oushda is also four or five days from
Oran, and six days from Fez.The Desert commences beyond the Mulweeah,
at more than forty leagues from Tlemsen.Like the Algerian Angad, which
extends to the south of Tlemsen, it is of frightful sterility,
particularly in summer.In this season, one may march for six or eight
hours without finding any water.It is impossible to carry on military
operations in such a country during summer.On this account, Marshal
Bugeaud soon excavated Oushda and returned to the Tlemsen territory.Aghla is a town, or rather large village, of the district of Fez, where
the late Muley Suleiman occasionally resided.It is situated along the
river Wad Vergha, in a spacious and well-cultivated district.A great
market of cattle, wool, and bees'-wax, is held in the neighbourhood.The
country abounds in lions; but, it is pretended, of such a cowardly race,
that a child can frighten them away.Hence the proverb addressed to a
pusillanimous individual, "You are as brave as the lions of Aghla, whose
tails the calves eat."The Arabs certainly do occasionally run after
lions with sticks, or throw stones at them, as we are accustomed to
throw stones at dogs.Nakhila, _i.e._, "little palm," is a little town of the province of
Temsna, placed in the river Gueer; very ancient, and formerly rich and
thickly populated.A great mart, or souk, is annually held at this
place.It is the site of the ancient Occath.Meshru Khaluf, _i.e._, "ford, or watering-place of the wild-boar," in
the district of the Beni-Miskeen, is a populated village, and situated
on the right bank of the Ovad Omm-Erbergh, lying on the route of many of
the chief cities.Here is the ford of Meshra Khaluf, forty-five feet
wide, from which the village derives its name.On the map will be seen many places called Souk.The interior tribes
resort thither to purchase and exchange commodities.The market-places
form groups of villages.It is not a part of my plan to give any
particular description of them.Second, those places distinguished in the kingdom of Morocco, including
Sous, Draha, and Tafilett.Tefza, a Berber name, which, according to some, signifies "sand," and to
others, "a bundle of straw," is the capital of the province of Todla,
built by the aborigines on the <DW72> of the Atlas, who surrounded it
with a high wall of sandstone (called, also, Tefza.)At two miles east
of this is the smaller town of Efza, which is a species of suburb,
divided from Tefza by the river Derna.The latter place is inhabited
certainly by Berbers, whose women are famous for their woollen works and
weaving.Tefza is also celebrated for its native black and white woollen
manufactures.The population of the two places is stated at upwards of
10,000, including 2,000 Jews.Pitideb, or Sitideb, is another fine town in the neighbourhood, built by
the Amazirghs on the top of a high mountain.The inhabitants are
esteemed the most civilized of their nation, and governed by their own
elders and chiefs, they live in a state of almost republican
independence.Some good native manufactures are produced, and a large
commerce with strangers is carried on.The women are reputed as being
extremely fair and fascinating.Ghuer, or Gheu, (War, _i.e._, "difficult?")is a citadel, or rather a
strong, massive rock, and the most inaccessible of all in Morocco,
forming a portion of the mountains of Jedla, near the sources of the Wad
Omm-Erbegh.This rocky fort is the residence of the supreme Amrgar, or
chief of the Amazirghs, who rendered himself renowned through the empire
by fighting a pitch-battle with the Imperial troops in 1819.Such chiefs
and tribes occasion the weakness of the interior; for, whenever the
Sultan has been embroiled with European Powers, these aboriginal
Amazirghs invariably seized the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and
ancient grudges.The Shereefs always compound with them, if they can,
these primitive tribes being so many centres of an _imperium imperio_,
or of revolt and disaffection.Tijijet in the province of Dukkalah, situate on the left bank of the
river Omm-Erbegh, along the route from Fez to Morocco, is a small town,
but was formerly of considerable importance.A famous market for grain is held here, which is attended by the tribe
of the Atlas: the country abounds in grain and cattle of the finest
breed.Bulawan or Bou-el-Awan, "father of commodious ways or journeys," is a
small town of 300 houses, with an old castle, formerly a place of
consequence; and lying on an arm of the river Omm-Erbegh _en route_ from
Morocco to Salee and Mequinez and commanding the passage of the river.It is 80 miles from Morocco, and 110 from Salee.On the opposite side of
the river, is the village of Taboulaunt, peopled mostly with Jews and
ferrymen.Soubeit is a very ancient city on the left bank of the Omm-Erbegh,
surrounded with walls, and situate twenty miles from El-Medina in a
mountainous region abounding with hares; it is inhabited by a tribe of
the same name, or probably Sbeita, which is also the name of a tribe
south of Tangier.Meramer is a city built by the Goths on a fertile plain, near Mount
Beni-Megher, about fourteen miles east of Saffee, in the province of
Dukkala, and carrying on a great commerce in oil and grain.El-Medina is a large walled populous city of merchants and artizans, and
capital of the district of Haskowra; the men are seditious, turbulent
and inhospitable; the women are reputed to be fair and pretty, but
disposed, when opportunity offers, to confer their favours on strangers.There is another place four miles distant of nearly the same name.Tagodast is another equally large and rich city of the province of
Haskowra crowning the heights of a lofty mountain surrounded by four
other mountains, but near a plain of six miles in extent, covered with
rich vegetation producing an immense quantity of Argan oil, and the
finest fruits.This place contains about 7,000 inhabitants, who are a noble and
hospitable race.Besides, Argan oil, Tagodast is celebrated for its red
grapes, which are said to be as large as hen's eggs--the honey of
Tagodast is the finest in Africa.Dimenet or Demnet is a considerable town, almost entirely populated by
the Shelouhs and Caraaite Jews; it is situate upon the <DW72>s of a
mountain of the same name, or Adimmei, in the district of Damnat,
fifteen miles distant from Wad Tescout, which falls into the Tensift.The inhabitants are reputed to be of a bad and malignant character, but,
nevertheless, learned in Mussulman theology, and fond of disputing with
foreigners.Orthodoxy and morality are frequently enemies of one
another, whilst good-hearted and honest people are often hetherodox in
their opinions.Aghmat, formerly a great and flourishing city and capital of the
province of Rhamna, built by the Berbers, and well fortified--is now
fallen into decay, and consists only of a miserable village inhabited by
some sixty families, among which are a few Jews--Aghmat lies at the foot
of Mount Atlas, on the road which conducts to Tafilett, near a river of
the same name, and in the midst of a fine country abounding in orchards
and vine-yards; Aghmat was the first capital of the Marabout dynasty.Fronga is a town densely populated almost entirely by Shelouhs and Jews,
lying about fifteen miles from the Atlas range upon an immense plain
which produces the finest grain in Morocco.Tednest, the ancient capital of the province of Shedmah, and built by
the Berbers, is deliciously placed upon a paridisical plain, and was
once the residence of the Shereefs.It contains a population of four
thousand souls, one thousand eight hundred being Jews occupied with
commerce, whilst the rest cultivate the land.This is a division of
labour amongst Mahometans and Israelites not unfrequent in North Africa.But, as in Europe, the Jew is the trader, not the husbandman.Tekoulet is a small and pretty town, rising a short distance from the
sea, by the mouth of the stream Dwira, in the province of Hhaha.The
water is reckoned the best in the province, and the people are honest
and friendly; the Jews inhabit one hundred houses.Tesegdelt, is another city of the province of Hhaha, very large and
rich, perched high upon a mountain, and that fortified by nature.The
principal mosque is one of the finest in the empire.Tagawost is a city, perhaps the most ancient, and indeed the largest of
the province of Sous.It is distant ten miles from the great river Sous,
and fifty from the Atlas.The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of
stone.Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good
workmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all
engaged in continual hostilities with one another.The men are, however,
honest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish.Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was
born in this city.Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.Fedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,
reclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,
and contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by
republican institutions.It is twenty miles E.N.E.Beneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the
Atlas.It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the
southern Atlas.Beni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of
Draha, and a small place, but populated and commercial.On the river of
the same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.Tatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,
situate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous
for the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.Tatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg.Akka consists of two hundred houses,
inhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews.The environs are highly
cultivated.Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the
foot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg.Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built
by the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all
the cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by
respective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews.Cities are also divided
in this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha.The sea on the
coast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber.The town is named Assah, and
distant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses
on each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea.The place
is of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,
to which many people resort.Assah is
also the name of the district though which the Sous river flows.The
Bas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper
part of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of
Sous.Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about
six hundred people.Talent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber
termination.The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr.It is a strong city, and capital of the province
of Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous.This province is sometimes
called Tesset, or Tissert.A portion of it is also denominated
Blad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded
in 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa.This
prince was the bug-bear of Captain Riley.The district contains upwards
of twenty-five thousand Shelouhs and industrious Arabs.Talent is the
residence of the prince, and is situate on the declivity of a hill, not
far from the river Wad-el-Mesah, or Messa, and a mile from Ilekh, or
Ilirgh, a populous village, where there is a famous sanctuary, resorted
to by the Mahometans of the surrounding regions, of the name of Sidi
Hamed-ou-Mousa, (probably Ben Mousa).The singularity of this sacred
village is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population.But
they seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of
North Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange
of the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European
articles of use and luxury.Shtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or,
as stated by Davidson, a _district_.The fact is, many African districts
are called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice
versa_.This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is
inhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a
Sheikh, nearly independent of Morocco.On Talent and Shtouka, Mr."There is no town called
Stuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is
Tilin.The Mesah flows through Stuka, in which district are twenty
settlements, or rather towns, some of which are large.They are known in
general by the names of the Sheikhs who inhabit them.I stopped at
Sheikh Hamed's.Tilin was distant from this spot a day's journey in the
mountains towards the source of the river.If by Talent, Tissert is
meant, Oferen (a town) is distant six miles."On the province of Sous generally, Don J.A.Conde has this note:--

"In this region (Sous) near the sea, is the temple erected in honour of
the prophet Jonas; it was there he was cast out of the belly of the
whale."This temple, says Assed Ifriki, is made of the bones of whales
which perish on this coast.A little further on, he alludes to the
breaking of horses, and being skilful in bodily exercises, for the Moors
and Numidians have always been renowned in that respect.In the lesser and more remote towns, I have followed generally the
enumeration of Count Graeberg, but there are many other places on the
maps, with varieties of names or differences of position.Our geography
of the interior of Morocco, especially in the South, is still very
obscure, and I have only selected those towns and places of whose
present existence there is no question.My object, in the above
enumeration, has been simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of
the population and resources of this country.Of the strength and number
of the tribes of the interior, we know scarcely anything.The names of
the towns and villages of the South, so frequently beginning and ending
with T., sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the Berber
population, under the names of Shelouh or Amazirgh, whilst the great
error of writers has been to represent the Arabs as more numerous than
this aboriginal population.Monsieur E. Renou, in his geographical description of the Empire of
Morocco (Vol.of the "Exploration Scientifique," &c.)foolishly
observes that there is no way of arriving at correct statistics of this
empire, except by comparing it with Algeria; and then remarks, which is
true enough, "Malheureusement, la population de l'Algerie n'est pas
encore bien connue."When, however, he asserts that the numbers of
population given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost
unpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with
him from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary
countries generally.Jackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen
millions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to.Graeberg
estimates it at eight millions and a half.But how, or why, or
wherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine.Certain
it is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely
represent one million of inhabitants.But for those who like to see
something more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the
estimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those
of Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason.Graeberg thus classifies and
estimates the population.Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000
  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000
  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.3,550,000
  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.740,000
  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500
  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000
  Europeans and Christians                      300
  Renegades                                     200
                                         ----------
                Total                     8,500,000

If two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will
have something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco.It
is hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being
simply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs.I am quite sure there
are no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.Of the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting
cluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq.Shaw mentions them as "a knot
of villagers," noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the
western province of Algeria with dates.We have now more ample
information of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an
agglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are
Maiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega
twelve hundred.The others vary from one or two hundred houses.The
villages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a
quarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf ("river
of the wild boar") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing
varieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round
with prickly-pears.Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides
barley sufficient for consumption.The Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with
inexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by
means of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an
hour.The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the
falling of sand in the hour-glass.Some of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well
built; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,
and the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,
appointed by the Sultan of Morocco.These Saharan villages are eternally
in strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms.On this account,
they are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.The immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of
all life in the desert.But the imaginations of the people are not
satisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause
lies deeply in the human heart.They say, however, their ancestors were
cursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and
this was his anathema, "God make you, until the day of judgment, like
wool-comber's cards, the one gnawing the other!"Their wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and
fruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts
of the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed.They have,
besides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a
long time established.But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and
various branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial
relations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,
generally prosperous.London Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor's garden, and the Argan
Forests.--Another interview with the Governor of Mogador on the
Anti-Slavery Address.--Opinion of the Moors on the Abolition of Slavery.We have at times imported into Mogador a stray London Jew or so, of the
lower lemon-selling sort.These lads from the Minories, are highly
exasperated against the Moors for treating them with so much contempt.Indeed, a high-spirited London Jew-boy will not stop at Mogador, though
the adult merchant will, to get money, for mankind often learn baseness
with age, and pass to it through a golden door.One of these Jew-boys,
being cursed by a man, naturally cursed him again, "an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth."Willshire did not think so; and, on the
complaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into
a Moorish prison, where he remained for some days.This is one more
instance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where
everything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government
authorities.A fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the
rich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being
built chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood.The Governor
got up, and went to the scene of "conflagration;" he cracked a few jokes
with the people and went home to bed.The Moors were sorry the fire did
not extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few
of the merchant's goods.Elton, with other friends, to spend the day
in the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)
sometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours' ride south from
Mogador.The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of
Deeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well
as night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain
having fallen up the country, though none on the coast.These Barbary
streams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of
Job, "deceitful as a brook."To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;
to-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,
covers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is
concealed.Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having
their source in mountains.The book of Job may also refer to the
disappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and
thirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,
and so perish.The country in the valley of the Emperor's garden offers nothing
remarkable.Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos
and Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all
that broke the monotony of a perfect waste.There were no cultivated
lands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents
this desolate aspect.We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,
which the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,
the mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious
surge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no
more nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching
them the mercy of God!the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful
patriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad
sinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an
African sun.A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be
contemplated than a large and lofty branching tree; in its boughs and
leaves, endlessly varying, matted together and intersecting each other,
we see the palpable image of infinity.But in the dry and hot climate of
Africa, this tree is a luxury which cannot be appreciated in Europe.We sat under its fresh shade awhile, gazing with security at the bright
fires of the sun, radiating over and through all visible nature.To
check our enthusiasm, we had strewn at our feet old broken bottles and
crockery, the _debris_ and classic relics of former visitors, who were
equally attentive to creature-comforts as to the grandeur of the Argan
monarch of the surrounding forest.The Emperor's garden contains a well of water and a few fruit-trees, on
the trunk of one of which, a fine fig-tree, were carved, in durable
bark, the names of European visitors.Among the rest, that of a famous
_belle_, whose gallant worshippers had cut her name over all its broad
trunk, though they may have failed to cut their own on the plastic and
india-rubber tablet of the fair one's heart.This carving on the
fig-tree is the sum of all that Europeans have done in Morocco during
several ages.We rather adopt Moorish habits, and descend to their
animal gratifications than inculcate our own, or the intellectual
pleasures of Christian nations.European females brought up in this
country, few excepted, adopt with gusto the lascivious dances of the
Mooresses; and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the
male class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of
their passions?While reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor
related to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these
wilds.At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who
prevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before
them in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and
voluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed
this way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend
to his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.On another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every
leaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid
earth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were
seen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills
among _parterres_ of roses and jessamines.The boughs of the Argan tree
also suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with
luscious fruit; but, on weary travellers descending to slake their
parching thirst and refresh themselves, they fell headlong into the
gaping holes of the ground, and disappeared in the abyss of the dark
entrails of the world.These Argan forests continued under the fearful ban of the enchantress
and wicked jinns, until a holy man was brought from the farthest desert
upon the back of a flying camel, who set free the spell-bound wood by
tying on each bewitched tree a small piece of cork bark on which was
inscribed the sacred name of the Deity.The legends of these haunted
Argan forests remind us of the enchanted wood of Tasso, whose
enchantment was dissolved by the gallant knight, Rinaldo, and which
enabled the Crusaders to procure wood for the machines of war to assault
and capture the Holy City.Two quotations will shew the universality and
permanence of superstition, begotten of human hopes and fears.Such is
the beautiful imagery devoted to superstitious musings, by the
illustrious bard:--

  "While, like the rest, the knight expects to hear
  Loud peals of thunder breaking on his ear,
  A dulcet symphony his sense invades,
  Of nymphs, or dryads, warbling through the shades.Soft sighs the breeze, soft purls the silver rill.The feathered choir the woods with music fill;
  The tuneful swan in dying notes complains;
  The mourning nightingale repeats her strains,
  Timbrels and harps and human voices join,
  And in one concert all the sounds combine!"Then for the streamlets and flowerets--

  "Where'er he treads, the earth her tribute pours,
  In gushing springs, or voluntary flowers.Here blooms the lily; there the fragrant rose;
  Here spouts a fountain; there a riv'let flows;
  From every spray the liquid manna trills,
  And honey from the softening bark distills.Again the strange the pleasing sound he hears,
  Of plaints and music mingling in his ears;
  Yet naught appears that mortal voice can frame.Nor harp, nor timbrel, whence the music came."I had another interview with the Governor on Anti-Slavery subjects.Treppass accompanied me, and assisted to interpret.His Excellency was
very condescending, and even joked about his own slaves, asking me how
much I would give him for them.He then continued:--"I am happy to see
you before your departure.Whilst you have been here, I have heard
nothing of your conduct but what was just and proper.You are a quiet
and prudent man, [28] and I am sorry I could not assist you in your
business (abolition).The Sultan will be glad that you and I have not
quarrelled, but are friends."I then asked His Excellency if a person
were to come direct from our Government, with larger powers and
presents, he would have a better chance of success.The Governor
replied, "Not the least whatever.You have done all that could have been
done.We look at the subject, not the persons.The Sultan will never
listen to anybody on this subject.You may cut off his head, but cannot
convince him.If all the Christians of the world were to come and take
this country, then, of course, the Mussulmen would yield the question to
superior force, to the decree of God, but not till then."Myself.--"How is it, Sidi, that the Bey of Tunis, and the Imaum of
Muscat have entered into engagements with Christians for the suppression
of slavery, they being Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"I'll tell you; we Mussulmen are as bad as you Christians.Some of our people go to one mosque,
and will not go to another.They are foolish (_mahboul_).So it is with
the subject of slaves.Some are with you, but most are with me.The Bey
of Tunis, and the Imaum have a different opinion from us.They think
they are right, and we think we are right; but we are as good as they."Myself.--"Sidi, does not the Koran encourage the abolition of slavery,
and command it as a duty to all pious Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"No, it does not command it, but those who voluntarily
liberate their slaves are therein commended, and have the blessing of
God on them."[29]

Myself.--"Sidi, is it in my power to do anything for you in London?"The Governor.--"Speak well of me, that is all.Tell your friends I did
all I could for you."I may mention the opinions of the more respectable Moors, as to the
mission.They said, "If you had managed your mission well, the Sultan
would have received your Address; your Consul is slack; the French
Consul is more active, because he is not the Sultan's merchant.Our
Sultan must receive every person, even a beggar, because God receives
all.You would not have obtained the liberation of our slaves, but the
Sultan would have promised you everything.All that emanates from the
English people is good this we are certain of; but it would have been
better had you come with letters from the Bey of Tunis, shewing what had
been done in that country."Treppass is also of the opinion, that a
deputation of several persons, accompanied with some presents for the
Emperor and his ministers, would have produced a better effect, by
making an appearance of shew and authority, suitable to the ideas of the
people.[30] If coming direct from Government, it would have greater
weight.He thinks, besides, there are a good number of Moors who are favourable
to abolition.Of the connexion between the east and Morocco, he says,
all the Barbary States look up to the Sultan of Constantinople as to a
great authority, and during the last few years, an active
correspondence, on religious matters, has been carried on between
Morocco and Constantinople, chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the
name of Yousef.If the Turkish Sultan, therefore, would _bona-fide_
abolish the slave-markets, I have no doubt this would produce an
impression in Morocco favourable to abolition.During the time I was in Morocco, I distributed some Arabic tracts,
translated from the English by Professor Lee of Cambridge, on the
abolition of slavery.A few Arabic Bibles and Hebrew New Testaments were
also placed at my disposal for circulation by the Societies.I also
wrote an Anti-slavery circular to the British merchants of Mogador, on
Lord Brougham's Act.El-Jereed, the Country of Dates.--Its hard soil.--Salt Lake.Its vast
extent.--Beautiful Palm-trees.--The Dates, a staple article of Food.--
Some Account of the Date-Palm.--Made of Culture.--Delicious Beverage.--
Tapping the Palm.--Meal formed from the Dates.--Baskets made of the
Branches of the Tree.--Poetry of the Palm.--Its Irrigation.--
Palm-Groves.--Collection of Tribute by the "Bey of the Camp."El-Jereed, or Belad-el-Jereed, the country of dates, or literally, the
country of the palm branches, is a part of the Sahara, or the hot dry
country lying in the immediate vicinity of the Great Desert.Its
principal features of soil and climate offer nothing different from
other portions of the Sahara, or the Saharan regions of Algeria and
Morocco.The Belad-el-Jereed, therefore, may be properly called the
Tunisian Sahara.Shaw observes generally of Jereed:--"This part of the
country, and indeed the whole tract of land which lies between the
Atlantic and Egypt, is by most of the modern geographers, called
Biledulgerid, a name which they seem to have borrowed from
Bloid-el-Jeridde, of the Arabians, who merely signify the dry country;
though, if we except the Jeridde, a small portion of it which is situate
on this side of Lesser Syrtis, and belongs to the Tunisians, all the
rest of it is known by no other general name than the Sahara or Sahra,
among those Arabs, at least, whom I have conversed with."Besides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branching
palms, whose dark depending slender leaves, are depicted by the Arabian
poet as hanging gracefully like the dishevelled ringlets of a beautiful
woman in distress, there is the vast salt lake, El-Sibhah, or literally
the "salt plain," and called by some modern geographers the
Sibhah-el-Soudeeat, or Lake of Marks, from having certain marks made of
the trunks of the palm, to assist the caravans in their marches across
its monotonous samelike surface.This vast lake, or salt plain, was divided by the ancients into three
parts, and denominated respectively, Palus Tritonis, Palus Pallas, and
Palus Libya.The first is derived from the river Triton, which according
to Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, is made to pass through this
lake in its course to the sea, but which is the present river Ghobs,
where it falls into the Mediterranean.The name Pallas is derived from
the tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic
expeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the
Jereed.The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy
English miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection
of water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,
interspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and
extent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in
the particular season."At first, on crossing it," says a tourist, "the grass and bushes become
gradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,
becomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt.This, as you
advance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and
unbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or
other sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in
depth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and
concentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except
with a pickaxe.The horse's shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its
stone-like surface."The salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and
not adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very
agreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of
commerce.The Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as
pieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic
inscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and
undoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no
difficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.The trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.The quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to
foreign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round
numbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.But in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year
entirely on dates."A great number of poles," says Sir Grenville Temple, "are arranged
across the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,
and from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which
compose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the
room is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,
also filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the
jar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick
luscious syrup.It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more
palatable than this'sweet of sweets.'"As we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must
needs give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that
the information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in
some respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa.The
date-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of
North Africa.They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown
trees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or
seven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require
sixteen years to produce fruit.The date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires
communication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid.The age of the
palm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the
Tunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy
years, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them
fifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin
gradually to wither away.But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that
the date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a
hundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before
it withers!The only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in
four or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin
to droop and wither.Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know
that the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain.In
many localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry
season; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm
grows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring.The sap, or
honey of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite
fresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp
taste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating.It is called
poetically _leghma_, "tears" of the dates.When a tree is found not to
produce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped
out of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is
drunk in its pure state without any other preparation.If the tree be
not exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,
at the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped.The palm
is capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be
easily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a
narrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is
allowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.This sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_
or _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,
or what we should call _toddy_.It is usual for persons of distinction
to entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,
with this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose.It
would appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a
cornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,
representing a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was
placed.Dates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,
which will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most
valuable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently
make it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.Certain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal
virtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,
and oil, make an excellent salad.The heart of the tree, which lies at
top between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is
eaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses
a delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.The palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,
superseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes
of the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of
other purposes.The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other
nick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are
made and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when
hardened by age, is used for building.Indeed, we may say, it is the all
and everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the
desert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the
palm_.The Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the
palm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made
for them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,
the palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former
infidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined
away, and died."God," adds the pious Mussulman, "has given us the palm;
amongst the Christians, it will not grow!"But the poetry of the palm is
an inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town
scenery.The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with
the great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred
leaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a
hermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the
serenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely
palm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or
planted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.I must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting
this extraordinary tree.And, after this, I further refer the reader to
a Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding
pages.A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely
less attention than a vineyard.The trees are generally planted in a
_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from
each other of four or five yards.The situation selected is mostly on
the banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring
hills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the
plants and the finer the fruit.For this tree, which loves a warm
climate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent
irrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of
little consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as
in the Jereed.Irrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer.The
water is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual
tree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and
fenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained
there until it soaks into the earth.(All irrigation is, indeed,
effected in this way.)As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit
of one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels' loads of
dates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the
load, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars.Besides the
Jereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country.Jackson says,
"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and
extensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and
picturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the
admiring eye.In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a
horseman may gallop through them without impediment."Our readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description
of the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr.I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,
as botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm
in this respect is just like the human being.The _female_ palm alone
produces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the
_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that
those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in
proportion.In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male
plants which grow wild in the Desert.They hang and shake them over the
female plants, usually in February or March.Koempfe says, that the male
flowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this
state, perform their office, though kept to the following year.The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,
Government deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants.It is visited
every year by the "Bey of the Camp," who administers affairs in this
country as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the
Tunisian throne.Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the
"Bey of the Camp" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his
successor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other
members of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from
father to son, only on the principle of age.At least, this has been the
general rule of succession for many years.The duties of the "Bey of the Camp" is to visit with a "flying-camp,"
for the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of
the Regency.I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,
extracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various
observations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of
Toser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.Tour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr.Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--
Plain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish
Infantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--
Administration of Justice.--The Bey's presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.Hot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr.Richard
Reade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay
their respects to Sidi Mohammed, "Bey of the Camp," and to thank him for
his condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed.The
Bey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, "Guarda-pipa," which
they did in the evening.At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,
one of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head.The Bey
proceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay
charger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of
the troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was
covered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of
attendants, in glorious confusion.The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes
  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20

  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who
  guard the entrance of the Bey's
  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20

  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,
  who are always about the Bey's
  tent, and must be of this country               20

  Turkish Infantry                               300
  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300
  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000
                                               -----
             Total                             2,660

This is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march
they were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of
honorary welcome for the Bey.As they proceeded, the force of the
camp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the
parties going home to their respective tribes.We may notice the total
absence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm.This may have been to
avoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of
the force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected.The
summer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and
other neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.Besides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery.The
band attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,
kettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the
report of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical
discord.After a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.Through the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four
miles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace.The
Turkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted
troops.Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our
respects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, "Guardapipa," as
interpreter.His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for
anything we wanted.Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey's
doctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our
whole tour it is impossible to speak too highly.The doctor had with him
an assistant, and tent to himself.Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several
other Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.About half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square
white house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,
or saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition.They told
us to go on, and joined us soon after.Two hours after us, the Turkish
Agha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men.The
Bey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the
shape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of
state.After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired.The Agha
was saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his
infantry after us.We retired for the night at about eight o'clock.The form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen
very large tents, was as follows:--The Bey's tent in the centre, which
was surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the
Bash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,
Haznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;
then further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the
Bash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with
the cookery establishment.Among the attendants of the Bey were the
"guarda-pipa," guard of the pipe, "guarda-fusile," guard of the gun,
"guarda-cafe," guard of the coffee, "guarda-scarpe," guard of the shoes,
[32] and "guarda-acqua," guard of water.A man followed the Bey about
holding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers
on its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels.There
was also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the
most extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd.The Bey did
not smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis.None of his ladies ever accompany him in
these expeditions.The tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each.Our tent consisted
of our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the
horses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain
Balfour's Maltese, called Michael.The first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we
slept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab
sentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the
camels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost
to drive away slumber from our eyelids.We halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few
things from Tunis which we had neglected to bring.But before returning,
we ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.The guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a
Genoese by birth, but now a renegade.In this country they do not know
what a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning
early, and wait till twelve or one o'clock, when they take a hearty
meal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the
season.Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told
him our object.We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to
pay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions.His
Highness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.On coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all
night.In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents
would not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always
struck at 3 o'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise
to great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest
part of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial
for the health of the men.The reason, however, was, to enable the
camels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular
and continual, is very slow.Of a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.The camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,
packing camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his
Highness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down.The music
was incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the
irregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally
rushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,
reloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.The order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along
about one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who
follow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the
Turkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of
the road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the
water-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry
countries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all
which, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,
or Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness.This done, the Bey gallops off to
the right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most
game--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place
and marches to the next halting-place.One morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback.Rade, "he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom
missed his game."As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they
remarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was
buried there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent
had been discovered.Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of
the remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct.The march was only from six to
eight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah.At day-break, at noon, at
3 o'clock, P.M.and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near
the door of the Bey's tent the hour of prayer.An aide-de-camp also
proclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the
morrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat
them whenever they can lay hands upon them.Captain B. was fortunate in
not bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him.The
Arabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not
partaken of by us.The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn
them into hares by dexterous cooking.The mornings and evenings we found
cold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.We left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only
their tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being
covered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them.The Arabs
were seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting
and pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and
bellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena.He was shot by a mameluke, Si
Smyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood.He was a fine
fellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog.They put him on a
mule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey.When R. arrived at the
camp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that
he would not eat the brain.There is a superstitious belief among the
Moors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes
mad.The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely
attacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only
chained up.He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large
in the woods.The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.Our tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does
not like the sandy and open country of the plain.Very thick brushwood,
and ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his
haunts.Several Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they
had charge.The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,
standing one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet
tied behind him.In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis
is a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being
never performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches.It is
very rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never
did.It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be
overlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes
in this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going
barefoot upon the sharpest stones.Severe punishments of any kind are
rarely inflicted in Tunis.The country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to
dissipate its savage appearance.The women of a few Arab horsehair tents
(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their
shrill looloos.We passed the
ruins of several towns and other remains.The camels were always driven
into camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,
or one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are
made to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait
and moody character.We continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,
and encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.One morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very
high and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge
remained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable
_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater
difficulty.Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the
disinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,
the camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way
of Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch
which would scarcely cost a thousand piastres!This stream or river is
the same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive
plain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or
circular villages of the Arabs dotted about.We saw hares, but, the
ground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few.Bevies
of partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them.In the evening,
the Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten
miles, and halted at Ben Sayden.The following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;
saw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,
but the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged
partridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot.Our
ride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for
the few inhabitants.After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and
bagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,
the Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm
had befallen us.On leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,
on which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.North Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along
our entire route.We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as
several single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did
not grace our supper with any.Saw several birds called Kader, about the
size of a partridge, but we shot none.A good many hares and partridges
either crossed our path or whirred over our heads.Passed over a running
stream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,
but in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in
good repair.Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in
which are laid the ashes of a saint.We had seen many such in the hills;
indeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more
frequently on elevations.We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish
infantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars
compared to the Arabs.On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,
and some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords
and small wooden and metal shields before the Bey.The officers kissed
the hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must
call their tumtums and squeaking-pipes.This ceremony took place every
morning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours.They
kept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by
their eternal cry of "Alleya," which means, "Be off," or "Keep your
distance!"These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will
soon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the
once formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of
course, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be
most unshaken.As we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little
cultivation.An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,
however, there was some undulating ground.Passed a good stone bridge;
were supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were
many droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and
gazelles.One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds
caught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good
half of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to
make a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate
creature savagely down.There were several good courses after hares,
though her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the
dogs and heading her in every possible way.Prince Pueckler
Muskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835.The town is clean, but
many houses are in ruins.The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham
are quartered here.The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to
enter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from
Giovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples.The
house of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.Going along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our
attendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned
man, and who taught Mr.R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,
jumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and
then seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave
the ragged ruffian-like saint.At last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of
exceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness
must have done the same.The saint accompanied us to the Kaed's house;
and, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping
on account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the
guards of the camp.We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats
which had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,
as we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the
sweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and
other jargon.We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by
order of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be
deposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure
of visiting his future burial-place.In this city, a lineal descendant
of the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the
essential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint.Saints of
one order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,
whom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call
_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing
with their habits of fleecing the poor people.Sidi Amour Abeda's hands
ought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with
devout and slavering obeisance.The renegade doctor of the Bey told us
that the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to
see us English infidels burnt alive.Fanaticism seems to be the native
growth of the human heart!We afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a
curiosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up
the water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the
drinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage
to all holy Mohammedan cities.We returned to the Kaed's, and sat down to a capital dinner.The old
Governor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with
him, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted.We visited
the fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi
Reschid, an artillery-officer.We then returned to the camp, and found
Santa Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,
employed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.He was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey.It was given
out, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and
Tripoli, by his Government.He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular
as some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of
us, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it
like a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey's tent in person, and
asking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.We went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,
morning and evening, whilst at Kairwan.There were many plaintiffs, but
no defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary
manner.To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to
obtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs.The Bey,
being in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who
drove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked
("taba,") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey's property.It was
a curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot
iron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late
different owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants
of the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of
necessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice.About two
hundred changed hands in this way.The Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out.He
has overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;
these let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,
at so much per head.The overseers annually render an account of them to
Government, and, when called upon, supply the number required.At this
time, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had
been very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just
mentioned.If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted
thirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin
districts, the Bey's acquisition in this way is considerable.A few
years ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty
camels, the duty for which the Bey remitted.The camel, if ever so
healthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never
supersede the labour of mules.The camel is only useful where there are
vast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,
and some parts of the East Indies.A hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey
for inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,
firing off their long guns.We crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many
gallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,
unless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except
found asleep.On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs
caught.R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he
was insulted by an Arab.R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the
Bey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and
to be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up
and generously begged him off.This is the end of most bastinados in the
country.We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some
persons, and was very dangerous.A muddy stream, they add, is often very
fatal to travellers.The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a
handsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the
Frenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to
the Bey's mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.Under such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.The Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,
with black wings, and flies like a plover.We had a large
hawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,
which sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.Marched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an
ancient town.Shaw says, "Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum
Chilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla.We have
here the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some
other fragments of large buildings.According to the tradition of the
Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle
pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing
hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground.For Ja Elma
signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!'an expression we are to
imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream."During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.We proceeded about
twenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah.This river
comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp
arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district
to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched.When
we arrived, the water had just come.We saw warrens of hares, and caught
many with the dogs.Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was
fired at, and went off scampering on three legs.The hawks caught a
beautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the
small hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of
long white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,
which they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye.A curious
prickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its
leaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert.The Bey made R. a
present of the hobara.One day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.'s greyhound,
which behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every
now and then attacking him in the hind-quarters.Saw seven or eight
hobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a
gazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an
Arab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating
"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of
the saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once
thickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more
Arabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of
horses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an
opportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of
hobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,
also some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;
after a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging
out of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,
but which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out
from its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,
catches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the
other; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the
other, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon
a herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the
gazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely
time to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of
which lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of
strong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we
started a great number.We saw another description of bird, called
rhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more
swiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient
Roman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen
miles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign
of such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates
which they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;
some remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct
leading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and
following it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the
camels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which
the soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly
thorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,
chopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the
chiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,
riding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These
palanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,
tinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance
makes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine
horses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were
joined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"
and kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them
managed themselves and their arms and horses with great address,
balancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,
throwing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once
losing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;
two of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful
gash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and
looked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in
view of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and
green after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a
range of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with
dirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally
hot and mineral waters.Although the Moors, by their religion, are
enjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change
their linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,
however, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the
neighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their
hahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women
are often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs
extended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and
continuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the
phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were
observed by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities
besides them.Shaw says: "'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'
and the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of
the mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like
quality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they
become cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville
Temple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five
degrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in
this stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and
resemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce
mentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of
Feriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and
pieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it
one half the natural size:

[Illustration]

The snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut
represents the snake half its natural size:

[Illustration]

The fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the
hot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates
that, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot
waters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the
apprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the
Gulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or
80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]

Many a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,
since water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all
regions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or
cooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be
no physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our
tourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily
irrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous
riches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning
simoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about
charming our Boab.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the
middle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing
the while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after
several attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach
something in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of
holy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish
next spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed
him down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also
his head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of
this sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented
the holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed's house; this
functionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch
of the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was
not a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,
upon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of
ruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an
irregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in
perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a
building is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;
the Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors
endeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,
even in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their
troops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an
earnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The
oil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between
stones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of
paste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub
with water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they
skim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,
they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;
the stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of
the oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below
where this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a
girl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed
herself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by
some twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took
off our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited
curiosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and
wished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces
with amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two
women screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one
of them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with
handlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,
something like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped
like a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of
large jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like
the guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a
young hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly
more like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in
with a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or
Jerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the
sovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of
Tunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if
asking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their
republic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance
like the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they
get nitre.The water which we drank was
brought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched
across a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was
congealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among
which also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called
Ghorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of
which grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and
reminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North
Africa are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the
presence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the
soil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being
occasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,
nearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the
ground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were
unusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of
about two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the
camp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious
spring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called
mokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and
of a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this
bird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on
the ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the
surface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when
it opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering
another series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it
rises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was
now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,
watered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade
of the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and
beauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the
towns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most
humbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped
just beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft
spar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline
effloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only
birds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We
particularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,
at a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry

arrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate
the famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as
far as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond
these and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an
immeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could
have sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before
entering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before
the Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with
open mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey
left his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his
Highness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had
also a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be
found in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable
assemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams
and the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the
date-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,
all of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt
new vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and
were surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the
date-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs
of Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable
town of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its
neighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the
traveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his
tent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of
_mud-houses_."Shaw,
who says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and
rafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been
made of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very
natural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was
the finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large
as Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and
crenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a
market-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare
on the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have
flat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part
built from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from
the common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old
houses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or
sun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little
rocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called
_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself
afterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having
irrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the
sand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are
insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water
from Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,
Abbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou
Lifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit
their grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,
Oulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the
finest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The
dead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,
more decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed
sepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents
the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted
the leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked
it.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the
evening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the
Jereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which
his Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here
is the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready
for the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each
date-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum
when the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is
very rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only
food here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its
stead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman
carried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's
officers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they
attended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing
for the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from
the burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and
found it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is
pretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are
supplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,
but with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his
taking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was
a large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,
hardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in
Toser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly
so; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The
neighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air
is filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;
the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures
the eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the
preservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of
all sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in
many cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,
particularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in
the Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North
Africa.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called
Jereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my
father;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish
breasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them
under the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making
them as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a
lark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and
shineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely
preferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all
attempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have
failed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive
whilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that
live in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the
same, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of
millstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the
walls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of
grain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with
onions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;
they colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,
though it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were
exceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of
ear-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a
thousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample
bosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low
down as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,
and carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where
they put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged
their hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's
mark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any
animal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,
receiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey
and his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a
mark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance
of a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders
and loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three
legs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as
possible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may
remark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all
the animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell
into the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept
their best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was
moving among them.The bastinadoes with which he
had been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being
applied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving
one hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people
being sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming
to anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He
was then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of
dollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of
Barbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be
found, the owners of them having died before they could point out their
hoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually
in the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing
whatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it
from immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that
under all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men
or demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long
journeys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and
making plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to
convince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with
incredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the
Sahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the
left an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of
liquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus
Libya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh
like the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very
respectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the
Bey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty
or sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort
immediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou
Aly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of
age.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very
clever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent
appearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in
his courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered
dates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which
has the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,
first dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,
which deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh's saint also
distributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as
well as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious
veneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would
not be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian
territories from the south, being five days' journey, or about
thirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'
from Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of
villages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent
of surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages
are Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,
and Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,
takes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of
earth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in
two, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,
and fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a
forest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the
water (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and
luxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group
of villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which
serves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the
aristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The
Shereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom
the Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of
the population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most
towns advanced in the Desert.They
are strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection
of the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the
very opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is
sojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on
condition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not
mount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has
placed the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as
the rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours
towards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the
gate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks
during late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the
Jereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes
place at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a
portion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed
proprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the
tranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the
happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of
Nefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens
are delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit
in the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty
peculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose
themselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route
laid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are
only known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in
these dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the
bordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,
cover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the
well-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while
dying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the
wiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The
weather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the
sky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so
many sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same
way as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot
make him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and
that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has
collected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much
pity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under
the protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone
upwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of
these snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small
bags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags
being extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their
mouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around
their arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile
screaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the
bystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually
perform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar
in their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives
them a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and
date-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is
extensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept
in the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in
passing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound
the poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for
Christians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_
towards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a
species of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is
tossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles
off we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising
perpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the
view was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only
just been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of
tuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first
animal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the
opposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,
prevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a
mass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of
him within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,
and he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our
attempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab
tribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in
the country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the
marks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab
brought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young
ones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though
one of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a
greyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our
want of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least
attended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a
horrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any
game at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic
plants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as
fresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an
ocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath
was water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in
reality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were
apparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps
of sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,
plains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown
together for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless
these savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind
as the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being
perfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming
an essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also
added to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been
coming in to a great amount.The
principal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and
almost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate
sort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are
also the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more
mealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very
fine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness
being attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the
past year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the
tree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions
of the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and
dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up
to R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the
Treasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the
brute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these
fellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,
lascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their
entertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The
Moorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the
French in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a
good old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often
distinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before
Constantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of
Arabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man
has just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For
robbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so
intricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali
brought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is
about a fallowdeer's size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but
long hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over
the fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from
the Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a
range of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought
from some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about
twelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the
excessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the
Government were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of
one was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode
the horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge
for the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and
exceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching
desert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels
reeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before
the tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the
weather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,
for during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three
died four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been
no change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared
the same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,
could not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden
transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of
the next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these
disastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite
unprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,
all the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required
comforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the
death of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which
the poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of
the weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a
soul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,
worthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at
200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better
built than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water
and the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good
as those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here
took our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of
the summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give
an account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to
Tripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke
Arabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from
Toser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued
cold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of
houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up
the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are
all that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses
perished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of
the camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about
two pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of
for four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to
the _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in
a like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good
horse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other
buildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is
seen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of
aqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this
country--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers
to Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be
constructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the
whole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying
water from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the
best and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the
Jereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this
country, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond
an old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from
jealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we
passed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be
remembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,
where are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour's halt,
and when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished
us with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to
Momakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,
the air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little
distance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of
those near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of
the city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse
belonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land
around.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached
to this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the
guard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish
musicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish
airs.We must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns.He
boasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four
at once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat
advanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he
can put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A
certain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her
two suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her
once a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be
separated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money
which he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he
himself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without
assigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum
in the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was
the Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and
injustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our
tourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,
and many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and
find that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned
men, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an
embarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor
creatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford
connubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to
divorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her
husband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself
from her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to
marry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the
Bardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small
date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a
few live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his
return, and both Captain B. and Mr.R. have had every reason to be
extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey
of the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the
Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various
impediments.Our tourists say generally:--

  Camel-loads.[40]
  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I
  imagine, the latter.)23

  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6

  Dates (these were collected at Toser,
    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding
    districts)                                     500
                                                  ----
                 Total                             529

  It is impossible, with this statement
    before us, to make out any exact
    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen
    to twenty-five shillings, say on an
    average a pound sterling; this will
    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads
    at five cantars per load                    L2,500

  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,
    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360
                                                ------
                   Total                        L2,860

The money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to
200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:

  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:
  in goods                                      L2,860
  Ditto, in money:                               6,250
                                                ------
                   Total                        L9,110

To this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and
other beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *

Before leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his
Excellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He
accompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting
until I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and
nearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was
satisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my
cordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during
my residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul
not excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to
accompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his
engagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of
his goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so
closely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the
following day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we
were at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my
journal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,
successive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner
was a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little
water, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely
under water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,
through huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this
time, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little
biscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most
accurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,
would now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and
wrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died
after a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that
died a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]

An aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for
the Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and
comfortably lodged in the Regent's Park.After my return from Africa, I
paid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of
smoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the
Morocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,
written at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the
present time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at
9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French
had taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some
brigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,
and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving
the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the
next morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred
French were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with
the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,
after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and
as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle
killed, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with
others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on
account of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people
from destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,
'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and
preventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to
save, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained
Europeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the
captain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the
Moorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the
British and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even
peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,
upon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband
and wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my
duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving
Mogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,
thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in
some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the
city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would
say, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their
best gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became
dispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,
about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly
all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and
the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to
defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves
of famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the
French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These
wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages
around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of
the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,
assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding
the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in
the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise
exposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his
wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential
was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent
confusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers
appeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by
hundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking
places for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their
rapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular
documents.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and
others setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and
licentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it
was that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight
through the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding
band, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,
insisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her
throat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would
the ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul
having prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at
this juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born
here, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force
to her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the
blood of their countrywomen.The chief of
the party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in
contact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which
the Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative
security.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad
forebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but
not before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a
sabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised
above, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded
it off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the
detested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine
years old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling
out _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson
joined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,
"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the
family, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties
of blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered
by the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,
was a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of
day was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their
condition more precarious.Lucas, who never once
failed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these
imminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most
hazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,
he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.Should any dispute occur in the English
territories, between a Moor and an English subject, it shall be decided
by an equal number of the Moors residing there and of Christians,
according to the custom of the place, if not contrary to the Moorish
law."We have for any complaint,
substituted serious personal injury, and I cannot but observe that the
making of the Emperor the final judge, in such case, is a stretch of too
great confidence in Moorish justice.Not that a Sultan of Morocco is necessarily bad or worse than an
European Sovereign, but because a personage of such power and character,
armed with unbounded attributes of despotism over his own subjects, who
are considered his Abeed, or slaves, whilst feebly aided by the
perception of the common rights of men, and imperfectly acquainted with
European civilization, can never, unless, indeed by accident or miracle,
justly decide upon the case of an Englishman, or upon a dispute between
his own and a foreign subject; for besides the ideas and education of
the Emperor, there is the necessity which his Imperial Highness feels,
despot as he is, of exhibiting himself before his people as their
undoubted friend and partial judge.So strongly have Sultans of Morocco felt this, that many anecdotes might
be cited where the Emperor has indemnified the foreigner for injury done
to him by his own subjects, whilst he has represented to them that he
has decided the case against the stranger.It is surprising how a
British Government could surrender the settlement of the dispute of
their subjects to the final appeal of the Court of Morocco in the
nineteenth century, and, moreover, allow them to be decided, according
to the maxims of the Mohammedan code, or comformable to the Moorish law!It is not long ago since, indeed just before my arrival in Morocco, that
the Emperor decided a dispute in rather a summary manner, without even
the usual Moorish forms of judicial proceedure by decapitating, a
quasi--European Jew, under French protection, and who once acted as the
Consul of France.There is something singularly deficient and wrong, although to persons
unacquainted with Barbary, it looks sufficiently fair and just, in the
provision--"he (the English guilty subject) shall not be punished with
more severity than a Moor could be," fairly made?In the first place,
although this does not come under the idea of "serious personal injury,"
would the English people approve of their countrymen suffering the same
punishment as the Moors for theft, by cutting off their right hand?Moors and Arabs have been so maimed for life, on being convicted of
stealing property to the value of a single shilling!Who will take upon
himself to enumerate the punishments, which may be, and are inflicted
for grave offences?It may be replied that this stipulation of punishing
British subjects, like Moorish, is only on paper, and we have no
examples of its being put into execution.I rejoin, without attempting
to cite proof, that, whilst such an article exists in a treaty, said to
be binding on the Government of England as well as Morocco, there can be
no real security for British subjects in this country; for in the event
of the Maroquines acting strictly upon the articles of this treaty, what
mode of inculpation, or what colour of right, can the British Government
adopt or shew against them?and what are treaties made for, if they do
not bind both parties?In illustration of the way in which British subjects have their disputes
sometimes settled, according to Articles VII and VIII, I take the
liberty of introducing the case of Mr.Saferty, a respectable Gibraltar
merchant, settled at Mogador.A few months before my arrival in that
place, this gentleman was adjudged, in the presence of his Consul, Mr.Willshire, and the Governor of Mogador, for repelling an insult offered
to him by a Moor, and sentenced to be imprisoned with felons and
cut-throats in a horrible dungeon.Saferty was attended by
a numerous body of his friends; so when the sentence was given, a cry of
indignation arose, a scuffle ensued, and the prisoner was rescued from
the Moorish police-officers.Willshire found the means of patching
up the business with the Moorish authorities, and the case was soon
forgotten.I do not say that the Moors are determinedly vindictive, or seek
quarrels with Europeans; on the contrary, I believe the cause of the
dispute frequently rests with the European, and the bona-fide agressor,
some adventurer whose conduct was so bad in his own country, that he
sought Barbary as a refuge from the pursuit of the minister of justice.What I wish to lay stress on is, the enormous power given to the
Emperor, by a solemn treaty, in making him the final judge, and the
imminent exposure of British subjects to the barbarous punishments of a
semi-civilized people."Renegades from the English nation, or
subjects who change their religion to embrace the Moorish, they being of
unsound mind at the time of turning Moors, shall not be admitted as
